LILLIAN SELAPISA My biggest dream is to heal. These were the words of Kopano Kgagodi, 16, from Mohurutshe in Zeerust, North West, who dreams of one day being a medical doctor and the future Miss South Africa.Kgagodi s immediate dream, though, is to get a lung transplant, or at least get a portable breathing machine that will help her live an almost normal life as she waits for a new lung.She was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease in 2013, an unusual condition at her young age.The 16-year-old s health problems started when she was five years old but it was not until she turned 13 that doctors were able to identify her condition. When she was five, she started vomiting. The doctors told us she was sick but could not tell us exactly what was wrong with her.As years went on, I realised that her condition got worse and I decided to take her to a doctor in Rustenburg, her mother, Innocentia Kgagodi, said.The anxious mother, who remains hopeful that her daughter will get the help she needs, said that despite doing all the necessary tests, the doctor could not tell them what was wrong.They only said that her daughter s lungs were failing.She was then referred to a lung specialist who could determine the cause of the lung failure.Kgagodi has not been to school since her diagnosis and is being home schooled.Her breathing machine needs to be constantly plugged in and is heavy for her to carry around.Despite her lively nature, a walk from her house to the gate is often strenuous for Kgagodi. It is quite hard being indoors and not being able to do all the things that others my age do, like going out with friends, Kgagodi said.Kgagodi, who stays cooped in her house because of her condition, welcomes guests with an infectious smile.After Kgagodi s diagnosis, her mother had to sell her house and they moved back to their grandmother s house to cover the medical bills.Her dream of being able to go out with her friends might soon come true with the help of a local non-profit organisation, the Keemisetso Foundation.The foundation aims to raise money for a mobile breathing machine through a fun walk under the theme of #Kopano4HopeCampaign.The walk will culminate in a concert, with the proceeds going to Kgagodi. We are selling T-shirts to raise money but we also wanted to do something that would be a temporary solution for Kopano because she deserves to go out and socialise like other children her age.All we want is a pulse flow oxygen machine, so we re fighting for this machine, founder Kgomotso Mokgosi said.Kgagodi s mother expressed gratitude at the support that she has received from the organisation. She said it has taken some weight off her shoulders. Every time I am at work, I worry about the electricity going off or something happening that may require her to go to hospital and I am not there to do something. The machine would make things better, she said.She said all she wanted was for her daughter to be able to live a normal life and enjoy being a teenager.snn4@thenewage.co.za
