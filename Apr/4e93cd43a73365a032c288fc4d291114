APRIL Fool s gags are annoying at the best of times. But what happens when they manage to screw you up big time?This is the place Google found itself in when as an April Fool s joke it decided to attach an animated GIF picturing a Minion (from the Minions film) dropping a mic as a sign-off.Great, if you re emailing a friend. Not so great if you re emailing your boss, or a prospective employer, or perhaps a bereaved loved one.After an avalanche of complaints, Google removed the offending attachment. We can t wait to see what they come up with next year. Jack WyattFor a weekly review of what s hot in your tech environment, don t miss TechKnowAge in The New Age every Tuesday
