Businessman Ajay Gupta, representing the Gupta family, dispelled rumours and aspersions that his family has captured the state and said he is not a lobbyist.Speaking at The New Age Business Briefing during a rare television appearance, the eldest Gupta brother was responding to questions posed him regarding allegations of state capture.&#8220;I&#8217;m not a lobbyist, I&#8217;m not a state capturer, as it stands I am a friend only,&#8221; a charismatic and energetic Ajay Gupta told delegates on Wednesday.The real state capture is done by the banks &amp; corporate SA the Guptas are just a convenient scapegoat #TNABizBrief Baba ka antshali (@MtshaliMdu) June 22, 2016#TNABizBrief Ajay Gupta says a total of 1% of business is with government, so how did we capture the state?&#8221; Mandla Nhleko (@Mgilija5) June 22, 2016An accountant by profession, Ajay Gupta rebutted the notion that his family has captured the state saying that what was actually going on, was what he termed &#8220;media capture&#8221; in reference to consistent media attacks on the Gupta family and Oakbay investments which create a public outcry once published but upon closer inspection have minimal to no verifiable evidence.With respect to the allegations of offering government ministerial posts, Ajay Gupta also poured cold water on such allegations while paying due respect to Deputy minister Mncebisi Jonas referring to him as a &#8220;respectable minister of our country&#8221;.&#8220;How can we be capturers but not win an account? Make up yr mind? Are we capturers or not&#8221; Gupta on Montana&#8217;s entry into fray #TNABizBrief Pinky Khoabane (@pinkykhoabane) June 22, 2016&#8220;Nobody can say anything bad about him even I won t say he is doing anything wrong. That&#8217;s how we are as a family. We are never going to say this person or that person is wrong.&#8221;&#8220;However when the Sunday Times publishes my name and that of our chairman at the time Mr Atul Gupta [in relation to Jonas&#8217; allegations] he was out of the country at the time. He never met with him. He [Atul] is an administrator and focuses on business matters.&#8221;&#8220;I oath that I have never seen him [Mncebisi Jonas] in my life,&#8221; continued Gupta.AJ Gupta is a great speaker; incorporating humour. Insisting that Gupta&#8217;s aren&#8217;t lobbying any business from the SA government. #TNABizBrief Bonolo Moeng (@Style_ChiefTess) June 22, 2016Oakbay&#8217;s strategic &amp; aggressive business model driven by being pro people. A true disruptor in the business sector. #TNABizBrief #influencer Bonolo Moeng (@Style_ChiefTess) June 22, 2016Following Deputy Finance Minister Jonas and a number of others allegations that the Gupta family had offered them ministerial posts at different times, the ANC launched a probe into the claims.However the probe fell flat when, according to Secretary General of the ANC Gwede Mantashe, only one person made a written submission.According to Ajay Gupta, meetings between himself and members of the government have in the past taken place in formal engagements, at least since Thabo Mbeki era.&#8220;We have sat down with Ministers many times to discuss issues. Every 1st Sunday of the month we met at the Presidential Guesthouse&#8221;AjayGupta Leanne Manas (@LeanneManas) June 22, 2016Ajay Gupta served on the International Marketing Council board (now Brand SA) under former President Thabo Mbeki since its inception in 2002.&#8220;The first time I ever sat in such a meeting was when the former President put together a consultative forum during every first Sunday of the month and we would sit in the Presidential guesthouse.&#8221;&#8220;Many cabinet ministers were a part of that, many businessmen such as mining magnet Patrice Motsepe and Naspers chairman Koos Bekker were also a part of the forum to talk about what we can do for the country,&#8221; said Gupta.Former CEO of the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) Themba Maseko was part of the International Marketing Council (IMC) representing government.Meanwhile businessman and former Minister Tokyo Sexwale told delegates that it was normal for business people to lobby government but warned that no one should be given unfair advantage.-Siphiwe Mchunu
