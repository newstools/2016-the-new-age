Presenter and actress Boity Thulo has hit back at critics of her sheer blue dress which she wore at the annual South African Music Awards last week Saturday.Boity&#8217;s blue number left tongues wagging when a photograph of her alleged &#8216;private parts&#8217;, supposedly seen through her dress, started making the rounds on social media.&#8220;OF COURSE I have to defend myself from all the harsh things I have been reading about my dress and the negative sexual connotations created,&#8221; Boity tweeted on Monday.&#8220;The picture going around of my &#8220;supposed private parts&#8221; was created/photoshopped by people who revel in cyber bullying&#8230;&#8221;Some people on social media defended the presenter arguing that it was not her private parts showing but a shadow while others remained adamant that there was a case of a wardrobe malfunction.HOOOOOLD UP IS THAT BOITY&#8217;S&#8230;.Her dress showing her&#8230;nvm pic.twitter.com/s38mAL6kJR grind (@vho_stxvxx) June 4, 2016Guys, surely ya&#8217;ll dont REALLY think Boity&#8217;s vag is on her thighs , come on now ! Those things look like shadows of the prints on the dress pearlzikhali (@PearlZ98) June 4, 2016Boity did not take kindly to all the sexual comments made about her and has made it clear in a series of tweets that all the negative comments were made in an attempt to demean her, which she found hurtful and disturbing.&#8220;And to pretend that what I&#8217;ve been reading has no effect on me is a blatant lie,&#8221; she tweeted.Only someone who hasn&#8217;t seen a woman&#8217;s private part would think Boity&#8217;s was showing in the dress she wore to the SAMAs bougie smalls (@Armely_) June 6, 2016The club 808 star took to Twitter to express her disappointment at those who tried to make her feel small for wearing something she felt comfortable in.We are always told to &#8220;not say anything because you&#8217;re in the public eye&#8221;, &#8220;Let them talk but don&#8217;t respond.&#8221; Well&#8230; Boity Thulo (@Boity) June 6, 2016&#8220;I will not wear something that does not satisfy me for the sake of pleasing people who are angry at how comfortable I am in my skin.&#8221; Boity proceeded tweeting making it clear that she will wear what she wants.All created in the attempt of demeaning me. How can I not defend myself? I&#39;m not a robot. I am a human being who has feelings.&mdash; Boity Thulo (@Boity) June 6, 2016We are always told to &quot;not say anything because you&#39;re in the public eye&quot;, &quot;Let them talk but don&#39;t respond.&quot; Well&#8230;&mdash; Boity Thulo (@Boity) June 6, 2016My line of work does not make my feelings immune to the negative words I read. And when necessary, I will respond.&mdash; Boity Thulo (@Boity) June 6, 2016I&#39;m truly disappointed as I&#39;ve realized that most of the shaming comes from fellow women. It baffles me.&mdash; Boity Thulo (@Boity) June 6, 2016I cannot and I will not allow your projection to force me into disliking MY body, how I treat it and how I dress it up.&mdash; Boity Thulo (@Boity) June 6, 2016I will not wear something that does not satisfy me for the sake of pleasing people who are angry at how comfortable I am in my skin.&mdash; Boity Thulo (@Boity) June 6, 2016I encourage and stand for women to dress as they please, in whatever they feel comfortable and good in.&mdash; Boity Thulo (@Boity) June 6, 2016Stop encouraging women to feel enslaved by who you think they should be instead of allowing genuine freedom of self-expression.&mdash; Boity Thulo (@Boity) June 6, 2016We do not share the body nor do we make a joint effort in clothing it and taking care of it.&mdash; Boity Thulo (@Boity) June 6, 2016-Nontokozo Gxumisa
