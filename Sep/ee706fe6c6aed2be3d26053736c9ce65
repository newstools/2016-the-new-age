Defiant University of Limpopo students who refused to go home when management closed down the campus on Wednesday, were yesterday happy when the Mankweng Magistrate s Court outside Polokwane dropped charges of public violence against their three colleagues.Police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo said the court dismissed the charges against the three students, saying there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the charges. Initially we arrested six students on Tuesday night and released three on Wednesday and now the court has released the remaining three, Mojapelo said yesterday.Angry students still gathered around the closed campus yesterday with only staff members remaining on duty after vice-chancellor Prof Mahlo Mokgalong ordered the indefinite suspension of lectures on Wednesday.Some students, coming from as far away as Zimbabwe and other countries joined theirSouth African counterparts who refused to go home, complaining of lack of money for transport to leave the campus.Mokgalong said the closure of academic programmes was in the interests of safety of students and university property.This after students broke down the palisade fence surrounding the university, shattered some windows and ignited fires in plastic dust bins deliberately placed inside buildings.They have also ordered local businesses to close down, claiming the move would force the government to accede to student demands for free quality education at tertiary institutions. We are closely monitoring the situation to prevent criminal elements from seizing the opportunity, Mojapelo said.Montsho Matlalamontshom@thenewage.co.za
