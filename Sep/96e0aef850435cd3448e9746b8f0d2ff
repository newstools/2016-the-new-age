With only 20 days left for matriculants to sit for their final exams, the Western Cape Education Department has organised a series of tutoring programmes aimed at ensure that their students are fully prepared for the upcoming exams. “One of our main objectives is to ensure that many learners as possible pass their NSC, making this a critical period for identifying weak areas and targeting support according to individual needs,”said Western Cape Minister of Education Debbie Schafer. Schafer said the programme will benefit both teachers and students. “There are also a number of spring holiday programmes for Grade 12 learners, as well as various workshops and development programmes for our teachers,” said Schafer. Schafer further said the department has also put in place safety precautions. ”To protect our schools, as far as possible, from burglary and vandalism over the holiday period, the WCED’s Safe Schools directorate has arranged increased security at identified schools”. Grade 12 learner from Hottentots Holland High School , Lihle Gxaba said that she looks forward to the programme. “I will be attending Spring school as I feel it will help me be fully prepared for my final exam,” said Gxaba. The programme will allow students to ask tutors specific questions on what they do not understand in each subject. Tutoring will occur on different dates for different schools. Aviwe Maxheke
