One thousand jobs are expected to be created during the R20m revamp of Mtubatuba s CBD, which will revive the historic area and boost tourism.Spearheaded by the department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta), Mtubatuba is one of the areas reaping the benefits of being part of the R400m small town rehabilitation jobs programme in the province.Cogta said its community works programme has created jobs for about 1 000 people in the municipality and another 1 000 will be created through the expansion of the programme. This upgrade is part of efforts to ensure that the town continues to be seen as a viable investment destination by business, Cogta spokesperson Lennox Mabaso said.Cogta MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube, who was in the area to introduce the contractor tasked with the revamping of the CBD, also officially opened a community gym in the Nordale area. The gym that we opened today is a sign of our commitment to seeing our communities being healthy. This gym also has a jungle gym which is being utilised by children as a place where they can enjoy themselves. We are also seeing the elderly who have various illnesses like arthritis and high blood pressure utilise this gym to keep themselves fit, she said.Mtubatuba is situated close to the iSimangaliso Wetlands which is a world-renowned heritage site.In the past, political infighting had stifled service delivery, forcing the department to take firm action against warring councillors in the interest of the community.The town itself is popular among tourists and the upgrade of the N2 going past the town is being extended to be more safe.&#8211;SBONGISENI MAPHUMULO
