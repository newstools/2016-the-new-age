Mabala Noise Entertainment announced on Thursday that it has just signed twelve artists ranging from the old school artists to new kids on the block.The record label recently signed Sidl&#8217;ukotini hit maker Rikcy Rick and has just expanded the family with more artists.&#8220;Yes, signing these artists means that the Mabala family has grown,&#8221; Nzuza said. Damn did Mabala Noise just sign Major League and Nasty C? That&#8217;s dope. Tshepang Mollison (@TwiggyMoli) July 21, 2016 Mabala Noise will compete with Ambitious Entertainment. This is a dope moment for South African entertainment! R A B U T H E A P E (@RabuTheApe) July 21, 2016The record label has signed kwaito star Zola, Latoya Makhene, PRO, DJ Finzo, Nasty C, Zakwe, Khanyi Mbau, the DJ duo Major League, Gigi Lamyne, Mbali Knosi, Uzalo&#8217;s Kay Sibiya and Jay Spitter. #MabalaNoise ia making all the right noises, let&#8217;s hope these artists are not hearing a very high pitch scarFace (@BuntuGqirana) July 21, 2016 Mabala Noise Entertainment has however dismissed claims that their artists get paid a monthly salary of between R500 000- R800 000.This follows a tweet that quickly went viral claiming that artists from the stable receive that amount of money after the announcement of 12 artists signing to the record label. Mabala Noise is giving artists a salary actually, Nasty is getting 500K a month and Ricky 800K. They also give them an album budget of 3mil New Boss (@Los_Acacios) July 21, 2016 Sikhulile Nzuza from Mabala Noise Entertainment told the New Age that the tweet bears false information and does not come from the entertainment company.&#8220;We distance ourselves from such, you know when you announce good news someone will always try to bring bad news, there is no such thing,&#8221; Nzuza said.-Nontokozo Gxumisa
