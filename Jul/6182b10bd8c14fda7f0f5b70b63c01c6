The North West Department of Health MEC Dr Magome Masike has officially opened Joe Morolong Memorial Hospital in Vryburg on Thursday.The MEC also unveiled a memorial stone in honour of the late freedom fighter and struggle icon Kesimolotse Taolo Joseph Morolong who was widely involved in the anti-apartheid campaigns and the defiance campaign of 1952 along with Ruth First.The construction of Joe Morolong Memorial Hospital has cost more than R553 million.During the official opening MEC Dr Magome Masike said that the delay in opening the hospital was mainly because the department wanted to make sure all roads leading to the hospital were tarred and good condition. I wanted to make sure that our ambulances are not damaged by the bad roads leading to this hospital that we had before. Now we are happy because we have the best hospital for the people of Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District. We also have good roads leading to this hospital. This allows us to render best quality health services for our people which they deserve, said MEC Dr Masike.The new Joe Morolong Memorial Hospital, formerly known as the old Vryburg hospital which was opened in 1947, was not coping with the growing demands to a point where the democratic government approved the construction of a new 120 bed level 2 hospital.The hospital provides much needed hospital services including inpatient, outpatient and accident and emergency units. Other services offered include a rehabilitation Unit, Theatre and 6 beds High Care Unit, On-site laboratory, Blood Blank, and Forensic Mortuary.MEC said that during the apartheid era only white people were good enough to utilise facilities like this one, and said blacks did not benefit from services like these. I am pleased today because we are giving you a facility which defines us as people who matter. These are kind of services that freedom fighters like the late Joe Morolong fought for,&#8221; said MEC Masike.The new hospital comes with a residential area made of eight three bedroom houses, 10 two bed room houses, 46 bachelor flats, a club house and tennis court, this is to help fight the challenge of shortage of health professionals. We are making sure that our facilities have quality residential areas to attract health professionals and retain those that we have. Having them stay within our facilities also make it easy for them to attend to their daily responsibilities and ensure that we achieve our mandate of providing quality health care for our people, said MEC Masike.-Dikeledi Ramabopa
