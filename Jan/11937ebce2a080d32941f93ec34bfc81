Several people were injured when a minibus taxi they were travelling in overturned on the N1 near Mokopane yesterday. Some of the critically injured were airlifted to hospitals by helicopter but none were certified dead on the scene. The cause of the crash is under investigation. The taxi was travelling south when it overturned, provincial transport, safety, security and liaison department spokesperson Kagiso Mootane said.The number of road fatalities in the province since the start of the festive season is estimated at 100. We are waiting for the national transport minister to announce the statistics before the official figure for the province can be known. Mootane said although traffic volumes subsided on major roads of the province yesterday, traffic officers would maintain patrols until the weekend. A lot of travelling in and outside the province will take place this weekend as schools reopen for the year next week. We have noted with sadness that speeding, negligent driving as well as driving while under the influence of alcohol were some of the causes of most of the crashes. Meanwhile, health workers have also joined in the safety campaigns by checking on drivers for sugar levels and high blood pressure.This after road safety authorities noted that driver fatigue was also a major cause of road accidents.Traffic officers have urged drivers to take rests at safe places on the roads to avoid fatigue.-Montsho Matlala
