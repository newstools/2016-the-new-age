Tshepo Masekela:&#8221;I&#8217;m planning to study for a Bachelors of Accounting at UJ. I feel really happy and proud of myself because it was not easy staying up late and waking up early to study, but I knew very well that it would be worth it.I&#8217;m glad that I could make my school proud&#8221;. &nbsp;Kirsten Klein:&#8221;I feel elated because I&#8217;m finally done with Matric. It has been a year of hard work and dedication which I think has prepared me for what lies ahead at university. I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to obtain the results I did without the support from my parents, family and teachers at Fred Norman Secondary School. M y Plans are to study Pharmacy at the University of North West and I&#8217;m really looking forward to it&#8221;.
