The provincial department of health has promised to provide wheelchairs to all deserving people living with disabilities in the entire province to enable them to reach short destinations.The promise was made by the health MEC Gillion Mashego when he was handing over wheelchairs to 30 people living with disabilities at the Tintswalo Hospital in the Acornhoek area near Bushbuckridge at the weekend.Mashego said his department was appealing to various households to bring forward people living with disabilities to their respective healthcare centres for a medical examination before they could be registered as people who deserved wheelchairs.He said the handover of the wheelchairs was held by his department in partnership with the Disabled People South Africa (DPSA).Mashego said the majority of the people living with disabilities were suffering, especially when they had to move around to collect medication at the clinic and monthly pension grants. The department will ensure that every person living with a disability that deprives them of mobility will get a wheelchair. I am advising community members to assist the department by bringing disabled people to their nearest clinics to be properly assessed by a qualified physiotherapist so that they get assistance. We are certain that the lives of the beneficiaries will never be the same due to the availability of the wheelchairs. We also applaud the partnership between the DPSA and the department of health in identifying and providing health care to people living with disabilities, Mashego said.France Nyakafrancen@thenewage.co.za
