Andrea Dovizioso won his first MotoGP race in seven years Sunday, pulling away from motorcycling legend Valentino Rossi late in the Malaysia Grand Prix to take the checkered flag for Ducati. Starting from the pole position, the Italian fell back early but took over the lead with six laps to go and quickly opened a gap on his compatriot Rossi. Dovizioso finished 3.115secs ahead of Rossi for his maiden win of the season and first since 2009. -AFP
