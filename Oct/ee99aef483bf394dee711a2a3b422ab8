The Kings of The Weekend DJ Sphectacula and Naves have dropped their summer smash single titled “I Do, I Do” featuring Zain SA on Friday. The dynamic duo is currently the reigning song of the year title holders and are now back with another banger which has the potential to be another song of the year smash single and a summer wedding anthem. “This is the next big thing this summer, it’s a promise to deliver music made with love and yes I do I do and yes I do.” The DJ duo bagged five nominations in the best dance, best duo, best video, best collaboration and song of the year categories at the Metro FM awards earlier this year. Fans took to Twitter to express their excitement about the long awaited hit. So the #KOTW have a new song out @SPHEctacula @DJNAVES I must have it.
