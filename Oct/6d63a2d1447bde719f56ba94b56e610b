The Egyptians are here to build again as they look to down a motivated Sundowns team that looks to achieve its first continental title. “But what’s more important is to win the trophy. I keep dreaming of the FIFA Club World Cup, but first we have to win this final. We are going to give all it takes to achieve that,” said Zamalek forward Bassem Morsy. #MomenSoliman: I’ve been in charge of #ZamalekSC for two months now, and our philosophy is different to the one we used in the group stages. — Zamalek SC English (@ZSCOfficial_EN) October 14, 2016 Zamalek coach Moamen Soliman said on the Caf website that he cannot imagine not winning the title. Mamelodi Sundowns will however not take the drive for the title, by the Egyptian side, lying down. “Our plan is simply unfolding. We played against Zamalek home and away and won both games. It is all about the mentality how we think about it. We have a fair chance home and away, but critically, it is important to score away and to make sure our opponents do not score on our home ground,” said Mosimane on his club’s website. Star player and PSL player of the season Khama Billiat said as a team, they do not want to get close to the victory and come back with nothing. The Zimbabwean said that the players want to be champions of Africa and they will fight with everything they have. “I cannot say we spent the whole week working on the plan for the final because the day we got into this competition, the plan was to win it. The belief is there. We will not look too much into the matches we played against Zamalek or what happened along the road, but this one has to be ours,” said the striker.
