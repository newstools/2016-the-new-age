The ANC in the province s legislature has dismissed claims by the DA that it was blocking opposition party members from being elected to leadership positions in the provincial legislature. The rules are very clear a chairperson of a committee is elected at a committee meeting and as far as I know there is nothing stopping any member, including from the DA, from contesting, ANC provincial legislature chief whip Nontembeko Boyce said.The DA criticised the practice in the provincial legislature that makes it impossible for members of the opposition to be elected as committee chairs. The fact that candidates are only sought from within ANC ranks means that those individuals appointed are not necessarily the best available. The exclusion of opposition candidates also has the effect of closing down opportunity for multiparty engagement rather than opening the space to democratic participation, Mark Steele, provincial DA chief whip, said.However, Boyce said there was no other way of electing committee chairs. Members of the committee vote and the candidate who gets a majority becomes the chair. If the DA wants to change the rules, the party is welcome to submit its proposal, she said.The provincial legislation recently elected a number of portfolio committee chairs after the position had become vacant following the recent cabinet reshuffle that saw some committee chairs elevated to MEC positions.CLIVE NDOU
