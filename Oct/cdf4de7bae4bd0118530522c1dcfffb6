The call for chambers of commerce to be established in villages, townships and small towns across the province takes centre stage this week.From today until Friday, Premier Supra Mahumapelo will lead the charge in the establishment of the chambers of commerce programme under the villages, townships and small dorpies (VTSD) development strategy.This will be supported by the provincial department of finance, economy and enterprise development.The VTSD chambers of commerce campaign is expected to mobilise business (formal and informal) to contribute to the targeted provincial economic growth of 6% by 2020.MEC Wendy Nelson said the chambers of commerce will also assist in facilitating engagements between the government and business community on matters relating to economy and enterprise development programmes in the context of the five concretes. This is in line with the fifth administration s vision and policies which have the potential to reshape the course of sustainable development of business in the province. The programme is among strategies aimed at addressing the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality within Bokone Bophirima province, she said.Nelson said this strategy was an essential ingredient for the achievement of the National Development Plan and five concretes that emphasise that the spatial distortions of the apartheid regime should be adequately addressed in an accelerated manner.The programme will be jointly implemented by the departments of finance, economy and enterprise development, tourism, local government and human settlements, office of the premier (planning commission), municipalities and traditional authorities.The chambers of commerce will be set at different levels in all villages, townships, small dorpies, municipalities and districts. Our approach is to build an inclusive VTSD economy that promotes economy and enterprise development, reduce unemployment in rural areas and utilise existing capacities within rural households to promote entrepreneurship, Nelson said.The MEC encouraged all formal and informal businesses to get in touch with their local municipalities in order to participate in the programme. Very often markets fail the poor such as in rural areas, or in the development of new products or services markets. The risks and costs of participating in markets may be too high. In other instances, social or economic barriers may mean that the poor are excluded from markets. The status quo cannot forever characterise our VTSD economies hence we have taken initiative that businesses in the province begin to participate in the mainstream economy, she said.Elfas Toreraielfast@thenewage.co.za
