Tensions have flared up at Hlangani near Giyani after a boy who was believed to have been abducted on Sunday last week was found dead inside a cattle dip a day later.The seven-year-old boy was reportedly playing with friends at Olifantshoek on Sunday afternoon when a red sedan pulled up and the driver called him. The vehicle then sped off with the seven year old on board. The boy was reported missing and police started searches until his lifeless body was found on Tuesday floating inside a cattle dip at Olifantshoek, police spokesperson Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said.Police have identified him as Hluvuko Design Vukeya.The incident has provoked anger among residents with some starting to point fingers at suspected killers and speculating on the possible motives including ritual murder or rivalry between parents for the killing.This has prompted provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba to condemn the killing and appealed to community members to remain calm. The motive and suspects in this case are still unknown. Community members are therefore requested to give police space to investigate this matter in full. Anyone with information may contact police on 082 451 7553 or the nearest police station or crime stop number 0860010111, Ngoepe said.Meanwhile, a 10-year-old boy Maboko Koketso Madibana who went missing from Desmond Park in Senwabarwana on March 29 has not yet been accounted for.Madibana was not seen again after he reportely followed an unknown man who approached a group of boys playing next to the local shopping mall, claiming he sought assistance to move a small fridge.Police have appealed to anyone with information to approach the nearest police station.Montsho Matlalamontshom@thenewage.co.za
