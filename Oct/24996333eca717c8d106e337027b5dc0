Facebook has launched a new feature for Facebook Live that allows users to don a variety of scary masks without putting on a stitch of makeup. With just a few taps, Facebook users can wish their friends and family a happy Halloween wearing a variety of limited-edition masks skull, evil queen, pumpkin and witch — when sharing live video. A selection of masks will also be made available after Halloween. Likewise, Facebook reactions will take on Halloween-themed symbols for a limited time with the Like symbol turning into a skeleton, Love turning into a candy heart, a laughing witch denoting Haha, a ghostly Wow, a Sad Frankenstein and scowling pumpkin to express anger. Facebook’s Halloween masks will be rolling out over the next few days on iOS in the US, UK and New Zealand. More masks will be made available on Android around the world.
