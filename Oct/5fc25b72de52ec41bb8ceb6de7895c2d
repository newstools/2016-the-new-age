Following protracted internal squabbles within the ANC in the Newcastle area, the party s provincial leadership has announcement the disbandment of its regional structure, saying the infighting is compromising programmes in the area.Tensions in the Emalahleni region have been linked to several political killings in the area, including the killing of ANC Youth League leader Wandile Ngubeni, who was gunned down in May, and ANC councillor candidate Thembi Mbongwa. To us the issue of unity and cohesion is critical, particularly given that factionalism has been blamed on the recent ANC support decline, ANC provincial spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli said. The provincial executive committee (PEC) had to intervene after realising that the region was being run along factional lines, Divisions in the region deepened after the 2014 regional elective conference when factions could not agree on who the party s leaders should be. Ntuli said factions in the region had made it impossible for the disbanded leadership to fulfil its duties in line with party regulations. The regional executive committee (REC) could no longer lead because of the faction, Ntuli said.The REC was replaced by an interim regional task team led by PEC members Sipho Gcabashe and Bheki Sibiya. Meanwhile, Ngubeni s alleged killers will be back in court this week.Sibusiso Sibiya and Cebo Buthelezi were reported to have been hiding in Johannesburg and were arrested as part of an intensified campaign to bring to book those behind political killings in Emalahleni.Five people have died in Intshanga in recent months due to tensions between the SACP and ANC supporters in the area. A police task team investigating political killings in the province has made several arrests in recent months The ANC, which had conducted its own internal investigation concerning the killings, welcomed the arrests. We have been demanding that those behind these deaths should be arrested so that we could all know who exactly is behind these killings, Ntuli said.The KwaZulu-Natal provincial government has also announced the establishment of a commission of inquiry to investigate the killings.Clive Ndouprovinces@thenewage.co.za
