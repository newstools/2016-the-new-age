The upliftment of the Eastern Cape s poorest communities through digital skills development was part of discussions among members of the IT fraternity at the Eastern Cape Broadband Skills Development Workshop in East London recently.About 40 delegates from the public and private sector, including provincial government departments, universities, TVET colleges, telecommunications and IT solutions companies congregated in the city to deliberate on the development of a provincial digital skills plan that will respond to the socio-economic ills of poverty and unemployment.The workshop was hosted by the e-Skills CoLab based at Walter Sisulu University in collaboration with the office of the premier Human Resource Directorate, Provincial ICT Working Group and Eastern Cape Socio Economic Consultative Council (Ecsecc). Let us work together to give our people the digital skills and opportunities to rise up from poverty, to rise up from unemployment, to rise up from illiteracy and innumeracy, to rise up from discrimination, to take their rightful place as equals in the new world in the cloud in the connected world, e-Skills CoLab coordinator Lorna van der Merwe said.Speaking on behalf of the provincial ICT working group, Chris Motsilili said on the status of activities in the province, related to the broadband rollout which will initially see the connection of up to 1 400 sites in the OR Tambo municipal district the majority of which will be schools and clinics. The development of skills to enable people to effectively utilise connectivity must proceed even though the implementation is delayed, he said.CSIR Merika Institute s Zaaid du Toit, a member of the national SIP15 team, said the skills deficit between government s infrastructure provision and digital skills competencies on the ground should be bridged urgently. Experience has shown that change management training for administrators and managers will be crucial for the success of the project. The significance of up-skilling and reskilling current and future labour markets in the acquisition of digital skills in the face of an ever-shifting digital work environment was highlighted in an electrifying presentation on what is known as Industry 4.0 and the gig economy.Esecc sector development specialist Tebogo Qholosha said a concerted effort was needed to address unemployment by training people with the requisite marketable skills. People in the province must be trained to keep up or participate in the ever shifting paradigm of work that needs and demands e-skills. We must initiate a skills development drive that recognises provincial development priorities and skills needed in the contemporary and future labour market, he said.Newly-appointed Nemisa board chairperson Prof Walter Claassen said e-Skills CoLabs were part of a national programme for e-skills development and work with multiple role-players in achieving their objectives. Skills development plans and digital skills planning should go hand in hand. This approach also calls for digital skills development which is linked to a more comprehensive framework of digital skills, Claassen said.provinces@thenewage.co.za
