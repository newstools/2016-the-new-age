A new high-performance touring motorcycle that references American bagger style design has been unveiled by German manufacturer BMW Motorrad. Based on a previous 6-cylinder sports tourer, the K 1600 GT, the K 1600 B incorporates a completely remodeled rear section, a lowered passenger seat, and effective wind and weather protection among its features, BMW said in a statement. Electronic suspension, assists for reverse gear as well as up and down shifts, fixed side cases and a folding rear mudguard are also included. The Shift Assist Pro means that riders can shift up and down without using the clutch in most cases; an Intelligent Emergency Call option for Europe ensures “the fastest possible assistance in the event of an accident or in situations of emergency and danger can save people’s lives — something that particularly affects motorcyclists,” BMW advises. A 6-cylinder engine posts 160hp, 118kW output at 7,750rpm, with a maximum torque of 178Nm at 2,250rpm. Price and date for the K 1600 B have not yet been announced. -Relaxnews
