Small businesses in the province are key to creating employment and generating higher production volumes and skills.The department of finance, economic development and tourism recently held an economic research day in Kimberley to support emerging entrepreneurs.The department said the purpose of the one-day event was to build sound and sustainable relations with relevant stakeholders. We plan to bring small, medium and micro enterprise support agencies, government, private sector and other institutions, that have the interest of development in the sector, the department said.The research day is to focus on strengthening small, medium and micro enterprises. The programme included a demonstration by the knowledge management and innovation unit of the department, on innovation and technology for small businesses, the department said.The purpose of the research day is to share knowledge with participants on best practices within the SMMEs development sector. A major challenge that was highlighted during the event is the fact that so much is being done by so many stakeholders in terms of growth and development of SMMEs, but there is a serious lack of integration and synergy in the everyday running of businesses, the department said.Provincial research day comes ahead of the provincial indaba event scheduled for November, provincial MEC for finance and tourism Mac Jack said.Jack said the indaba would also focus on the potential benefits to be realised when economic growth, job creation, income generation and the competitiveness of South African products, become points of emphasis and attention. The department, with the help of state owned entities, will initiate and support public education programmes that are aimed at promoting fair and legal trade with other countries, Jack said.He said to ensure the informal traders were able to survive, the government needed to support and nurture them. To ensure localisation and ringfencing of certain economic sectors to achieve real transformation, the government must ensure that a meaningful percentage of 70% of expenditure is procured from local SMMEs, Jack said.The indaba will be attended by different stakeholders including government officials and leaders in the informal trade. The department commits to cooperate with the South African Revenue Service and work with enforcement agencies to prevent illegal imports and dumping of unsafe products, he said.Jack, who was speaking at the annual small enterprise development agency stakeholder forum in Kimberly, said he was happy with progress made in the sector.The call to support small business was also made by Minister Lindiwe Zulu. She said supporting informal traders needed to be a priority for everyone, including the government because not everyone can be employed . We are working to open up procurement opportunities, especially in the public sector, for SMMEs, she saidprovinces@thenewage.co.za
