Accident victims in KZN have been encouraged to lodge claims directly with the Road Accident Fund (RAF) instead of using lawyers who sometimes charge enormous fees to help lodge and successfully pursue claims.Speaking in Durban this week, Ntsoaki Kunene, the fund s manager in KwaZulu-Natal, said by lodging their claims without lawyers, victims would have their cases speedily settled within 120 days and settled fairly.Without prejudicing lawyers, the fund said that some lawyers dragged out claims issues so that it became a court case (litigation) where they stand to benefit more. The longer the case drags on in court, the bigger the benefits for lawyers are. So by lodging the claims directly with us, we will determine a settlement and settle a claim within 120 days as stipulated by the law. So we are encouraging people to do it themselves so that they can save on legal fees charged by lawyers, pleaded Kunene.However, Kunene said the RAF was faced with the challenge of trying to locate claimants who changed their addresses and contact details.This, she said, was problematic as it causes unnecessary backlogs by blocking claims that could be swiftly settled as they have all the info needed verified.Kunene also revealed that they had problems settling claims older than five years and urged victims to lodge their claims within three years of an accident.She said this enabled the RAF to process the claim without prejudicing the claimants who came without a lawyer. Older cases are not easy to settle as we often try to deal with fresh cases and settle them as soon as we can, she said.Kunene said KwaZulu-Natal had about 8000 cases of people who lodged their claims directly and disappeared without trace. She said this made their work difficult as tracing these claimants was cumbersome and costly. The most important message today is that people should follow up on their claims and deal directly with us in order to help them easily. We plead with people to come to us to follow up on their claims, she said.SIHLE MAVUSO
