Following the publication of the news in The New Age on Monday of the establishment of a commission of inquiry into political killings in KZN, this newspaper has been inundated with calls from members of the public who want to come forward with information.The announcement of the commission was made by Premier Willies Mchunu.There has also been reaction on social media from across the country.The director-general in the Presidency Cassius Lubusi wrote on Facebook: This is a great step indeed. We need to understand this terrible phenomenon and rid our country of it for the sake of the democracy which we fought so hard for. We thank Premier Mchunu for this bold move. Without fear, favour or prejudice, the commission, under the able leadership of advocate Marumo Moerane, should expose the machinations of this evil force. Another member of the public, Mhlangano Maphalala, said the wheels of the government grind slowly, but when they do, they yield results. Given that one is close to some of those killings in northern KZN and how they are perceived in the communities, is somewhat akin to taxi killings, perpetrators get away with murder. Secondly, can we have tougher gun laws for possession, promised at the time of Senzo Meyiwa s killing two years ago? Addressing the media, Mchunu said while the provincial legislature was characterised by robust debate and a climate of coexistence of political parties despite them holding different opinions, there are elements hell-bent on creating anarchy in the province.He called on all political leaders to unite and grapple head-on with killings associated with intra or inter-political killings. These killings will be traced back to 2011 until 2016 before and after local government elections.He said the provincial government was determined to ensure that there is peace in this province. He cautioned that the peace-building is a process not a hit and run event.Members of the public who are in possession of information which may be relevant to the matters to be enquired into by the commission and who wish to give evidence before the commission are invited to contact the secretary of the commission on 0333454022 and solo@mdledleinc.co.za.Nokuthula Ntulinokuthulan@thenewage.co.za
