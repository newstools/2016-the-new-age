National and World Boxing Foundation (WBF) Intercontinental Junior Middleweight champion Nkululeko Bulldog Mhlongo has vowed to overcome challenger Frans Ramabolu tomorrow night. Mhlongo reckons he will not only floor the challenger, he will do his best to win over Ramabolu s home town fans in the process.The two gladiators come face to face at the Dr Molemela Indoor Stadium in a tournament that forms part of the Macufe Mangaung African Cultural Festival in Bloemfontein. Mhlongo is from Eshowe, KwaZulu-Natal while Ramabolu hails from Virginia in Free State.It will be the second time the two lock horns and Ramabolu will be looking to redeem himself. He was stopped in the 10th round by Mhlongo in Kimberley in February. I want to maul Frans. I have been noticing with concern the noise he s been making about making amends. There won t be room for amends because I will devour him from the first gong.His family and fans won t be able to recognise his face after I have severely thrashed him. In most fights I have seen fans of my opponents rally behind me. That s because when I turn on the style, they are impressed and entertained, Mhlongo who is trained by Sechaba Mabuya in Soweto, said. The champion boasts 14 wins from 17 fights, losing just once.news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Xamba
