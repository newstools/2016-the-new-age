Aoout 1 300 RDP house beneficiaries in four local municipalities under the Nkangala district municipality could not hold back their happiness when they were handed title deeds from the department of human settlements.The handover ceremony of the title deeds was held in Klarinet near Emalahleni on Tuesday. The beneficiaries are from municipalities including Emakhazeni, Emalahleni, Victor Khanye and Steve Tshwete.Among the joyful recipients of the title deeds was 54-year-old Olivia Mokgope in Klarinet. Mokgope said her life would never be the same again as she now had a title deed attesting her the legitimate ownership of the house. I am now living in the house as a legal beneficiary because of the title deed. I will have to safeguard this important document and I am proud because no one can remove me from the house. I thank our government for its commitment to continue housing us decently. Had it not been the caring government, I would still be living in a dilapidated shack in the informal settlements, Mokgope said.The title deeds were presented on behalf of human settlements MEC Speedy Mashilo by the Emalahleni executive mayor, Lindiwe Ntshalintshali. She said the occupants of the RDP houses were moved from the nearby informal settlement. Our people never had a chance to own a house in the past regime. So today, as the ANC-led government, we are hard at work in enhancing the lives of our people through a variety of viable provision of services including decent housing with title deeds confirming the legal ownership of the property, Ntshalintshali said.France Nyakafrancen@thenewage.co.za
