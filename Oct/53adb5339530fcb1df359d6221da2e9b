Residents of Ditsobotla local municipality should expect improved service delivery in the next five years, mayor Daniel Tebogo Buthelezi said.Buthelezi gave the commitment at his inauguration ceremony in Bodibe village, outside Mahikeng.He also launched his community outreach programme as he introduced Ditsobotla s newly elected councillors, promising that the team would work for better service delivery.Buthelezi and his entourage visited four needy families in the Bodibe area, donating groceries.Present at the inauguration ceremony were Ngaka Modiri Molema district mayor, Tshepo Makolomakwe, Ramotshere Moiloa council mayor, Kereng Mothoagae and Ditsobotla council speaker Mosidi Mmota. As a municipality, we will embark on a radical programme for socioeconomic development in our community, to restore the confidence people have shown in the ANC. Services that include electricity, water and sanitation remain non-negotiable human rights issues. We have made progress in terms of connecting people to the electricity grid, he said.The mayor was upbeat about establishing a crime-free residential environment so that the residents could live in peace. A R3m budget has been set aside to help with the installation of high mast lights in Verdwaal, Bodibe, Itsoseng, Ga-Motlatla and Springbokpan, Buthelezi said.On water supplies, Buthelezi said the council had a budget for bulk water projects and to resuscitate malfunctioning boreholes to increase water supply. This initiative will attract investors and retain big companies because they are part of the job creation initiatives in Ditsobotla. We will not rest until we are sure that water challenges in Ditsobotla have been adequately addressed, he said.Roads in the municipality have been a major source of concern but the mayor promised that attention would be paid to those challenges . As part of the rehabilitation of the roads infrastructure, Nelson Mandela Drive is being resealed to boost local investors and to regenerate the central business district which is pivotal to job creation. Better road infrastructure will help the community to access all the social amenities such as health centres and economic activities. More roads and stormwater drainage infrastructure will be constructed during the next medium term, he said.In line with the North West provincial government s villages, townships and small towns strategy,Buthelezi said the municipality had reallocated certain projects on service delivery and infrastructure provision to villages, townships and small towns.The municipality has also pledged to support emerging farmers by making available 640ha of arable land for crop production. The provincial department of rural, environment and agricultural development will provide technical support, Buthelezi said. This will also strengthen local economies by creating jobs and promoting job placement especially for the youth. In partnership with the department of social development, the municipality has succeeded in supporting two agricultural cooperatives, Tshireletso and Term City, by entering into a two-year lease agreement for vegetables and piggery projects as part of their contribution to food security and sustainable livelihoods, the mayor said.No sooner after Buthelezi had taken over than the municipality had provided tools of trade to 15 small to medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) owners. The beneficiaries were taken through a capacity-building workshop.In the previous two years, the municipality has managed to create 200 short-term jobs through extended public work programme (EPWP).At the moment, 43 EPWP beneficiaries serve the municipality on temporary contracts. A budget has been allocated for the implementation of a labour-intensive cleaning programme in various places such as Boikhutso, Blydeville, Itsoseng and Tlhabologang, he said.Buthelezi said that the municipality wanted to ensure that local contractors were considered within the legal prescripts governing supply chain management so that entities with capacity could also be appointed for capital projects.He said that the projects to fence and build ablution blocks at cemeteries planned for Ga-Motlatla and Springbokpan, would be implemented during the financial year. The process of establishing formal townships in Tlhabologang Ext 8 and Blydeville Ext 4 is already under way and the municipality is in consultation with Eskom and Sedibeng Water for electrification and the provision of water and sanitation in the areas. The municipality has finalised the draft layout plan for the new township establishment in Itekeng and is working closely with the department of local government and human settlements to address the backlog of housing in villages such as Bodibe, he said.Ditsobotla local municipality s housing delivery projects are under way in Verdwaal, Itekeng, Grasfontein, Bakerville, Boikhutso and Tlhabologang.Buthelezi promised that his leadership collective would work with all stakeholders including traditional leaders so that there was peace and harmony in our communities .Elfas Toreraielfast@thenewage.co.za
