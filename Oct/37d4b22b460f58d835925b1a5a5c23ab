Christopher Panayiotou s former employee Mawonga Ndedwa&#8217;s credibility was under scrutiny when he took the stand at the Port Elizabeth Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Friday .A phone call conversation Ndedwa made to Christopher&#8217;s mother, Fanoula Panayiotou was played for the judge and legal counsel during a short adjournment. In this call Ndedwa allegedly told Fanoula that he will bring her the phone Panayiotou allegedly used to call Luthando Siyoni.According to defence lawyer Terry Price, Ndedwa wanted to return the phone to Fanoula in order to get a reward. You told Fanoula you would bring phone back and were expecting a reward, he said.Ndedwa claims to have had a change of heart due to remembering everything Christopher had done for him.Price then asked Ndedwa if he thought Christopher was a man with money and further questioned Ndedwa&#8217;s whereabouts on the day Jayde Panayiotou went missing.Panayiotou&#8217;s lawyer went out of his way to show the court that the witness was not a credible source, due to him getting the time frame wrong in which he saw the R30K in the office and also down playing his relationship with Siyoni.Ndedwa testified on Thursday that a week prior to Jayde Panayiotou s disappearance he saw R30k in the storeroom and called Panayiotou to ask him about it.Price claims that Ndedwa would go to Infinity club for drinks with Siyoni. Ndedwa deliberately downplayed his relationship with Siyoni. They were a lot closer,&#8221; said Price.Witness claims that he would see Siyoni around but would not engage with him. Ndedwa claims that all 27 calls made from his phone to Siyoni were all made by Panayiotou.Ndedwa told the court that he went to the police after reading an article that stated the police were looking for the owner of the 0717059736 number that he owned.According to his testimony, Panayiotou used his phone two weeks before Jayde Panayiotou went missing. Panayiotou used the phone to call Luthando Siyoni. Siyoni has since turned state witness. Ndedwa says that the accused gave him R1000 to buy himself a new phone because his phone would lead the police to him.The case of Panayiotou and his co accused Sinethemba Nemembe and Zolani Sibeko is in the Port Elizabeth magistrate court. They are accused of the murder, kidnapping and robbing of Christopher&#8217;s wife, Jayde Panayiotou.Court has been adjourned until Monday morning.-TNA Reporter&nbsp;
