Oscar host Chris Rock has penned what is thought to be a record-breaking two-show deal with Netflix.
The award-winning comedian will deliver two stand-up specials to Netflix, and at $40m combined, the fee is said to make him the highest paid comedian where such deals are concerned (per The Hollywood Reporter.)
The first of those two shows is to be recorded in 2017, ahead of a world tour.
Well known for “Top Five,” “The Chris Rock Show,” and “Everybody Hates Chris,” Chris Rock picked up an Emmy nomination as the director of an Amy Schumer special on HBO, in addition to another nod for hosting the Academy Awards show in 2016. -AFP
