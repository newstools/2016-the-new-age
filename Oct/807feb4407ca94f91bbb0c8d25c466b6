The Sekhukhune district municipality has made a frantic appeal to residents to use water sparingly as severe drought takes its toll on water sources.According to municipality spokesperson Willy Mosoma, Burgersfort was severely affected as water from Spekboom river was reduced due to restrictions imposed by the National Department of Water and Sanitation.Mosoma said the municipality was pumping about 40% of the required residential demand for Burgersfort. This means if water is not used sparingly, communities will experience low water pressure and some residents may not receive water at all, Mosoma said.Orhigstad was also under threat, with the upper reservoir level at 69% and booster pump station at 53% at the weekend.The Flag Boshielo dam, which also feeds areas in Polokwane, dropped to the 20.2% level on Friday. We have reduced raw water abstraction by 30% to the entire communities who receive water from Flag Boshielo dam. The 20.2% water level will last until February if the rainfall situation does not improve, he said.Levels of dams in the district are drastically reduced. Readings on Friday were as follows: De Hoop dam 82.7%, Vergelegen dam 78.8%and Loskop dam 44.7% The municipality advised residents to close their taps in certain areas. No brushing of teeth on a full running tap. Install dual flush systems instead of the large flush which uses nine litres while the small flush uses four litres per flush. Not everything must be flushed down the toilet. Dispose of sanitary towels in bins instead of a flush toilet, the spokesperson said.Montsho Matlalamontshom@thenewage.co.za
