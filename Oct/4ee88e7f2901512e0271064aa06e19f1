Cooperatives are seen as a safety net that can relieve pressure on the government to meet all the social and economic needs of impoverished people in the province.Acting social development MEC Fenny Gaolaolwe said when properly run, cooperatives can give people a chance to break out of the poverty cycle.She was speaking to hundreds of people who gathered to mark the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty in Huhudi, Vryburg. Cooperatives are community-based enterprises that residents can form to improve their own socio-economic conditions. People should not rely on the government only. We urge you to form cooperatives so that you can sell your products to the government, businesses and everyone in this township, Gaolaolwe said.The day sought to draw attention to the impact of poverty in communities.Gaolaolwe appealed to residents to use the services of newly established community nutrition and development centres situated in deprived wards in all local municipalities.Community nutrition and development centres have been established in Tlapa village in Rustenburg, Ga Mootla village in Moretele, Moshana village in Ramotshere Moiloa, Matloding village in Ratlou, Nommer One village in Greater Taung, Phola Park township in Naledi and Khuma township in Matlosana local municipalities.About 16 other community nutrition centres will be added to areas across the province.At the community nutrition centres, the government has used the services of home-based care organisations to provide cooked, nutritious meals to individuals and households that cannot afford to feed themselves. We have implemented this programme jointly with the national Department of Social Development to feed the needy in most deprived wards in the province. Each centre has been funded with an amount of R19000 a month over a period of eight months. Gaolaolwe and a team of officials handed over grocery hampers to 16 impoverished households in Huhudi, Phola Park and other surrounding informal settlements in Vryburg.One of the recipients, Susan de Huis, a pensioner, said the food came at the right time. I look after my grandchildren and this food came at the right time because there was nothing to prepare for my family to eat, De Huis said.The International Day for the Eradication of Poverty has been observed every year since 1993, when the United Nations General Assembly took a resolution to promote awareness of the need to eradicate poverty and destitution in all countries.
