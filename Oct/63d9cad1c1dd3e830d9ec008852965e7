Africa s largest independent power plant, Avon Peaking Power Plant, located in Shakaskraal, KwaDukuza, has been hailed for putting the area on the international map with the historical move.The plant which went live in July was applauded by KwaDukuza mayor Ricardo Mthembu, for bringing international investors to the area, which has led to an increase in job creation for the community.Mthembu was speaking at a thanksgiving function in KwaDukuza on Tuesday. We celebrate because this is just one project that demonstrates that the country s policy instruments are geared towards the transformation of the economy while ensuring that we deliver services to our citizens, Mthembu said.The independent power project model initiated by the Department of Energy has been bolstered by the success of this project and the skills being developed with the community.Since inception in April 2014, more than 4 million hours of labour have been invested into building the 670MW power plant and more than 1500 jobs were created during its construction.A total of 88% of jobs were reserved for black employees of which 63% were skilled labour and from KwaDukuza with recruitment done incollaboration with the municipality.Avon Peaking Power CEO Arnaud de Limburg said that in the next 15 years of partnership with the government under power purchase agreements with Eskom, it was certain that more direct and indirect jobs would be created. The construction of the Avon and Dedisa power plants demonstrates the strength of the partnership between the South African government and the private sector. The plants will provide much needed power and energy security during peak demand periods. They will equally benefit the socio-economic development of the communities surrounding each project, Mthembu said with the new development the municipality would be able to continue with the expansion of the electrification programme to the remaining areas and rolling out solar energy in certain areas.He said this would have not been achievable if the national grid was under strain due to power demand and the provision of alternative sources of energy would help alleviate the plight of the people of KwaDukuza. We are in the process of finalising funding requirements for the amount of R2,5m as part of the agreement that was made at the beginning of the construction of the power plant, Mthembu said.The Avon plan has been developed by an Italian company.SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULO
