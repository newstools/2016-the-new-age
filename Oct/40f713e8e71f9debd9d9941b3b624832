Another counterfeit clothing factory has been busted by the Hawks in Durban, with fake Nike and Guess goods worth an estimated R5m confiscated.The factory in the industrial area of Mobeni, near Isipingo, was raided by the Hawks counterfeit team, ORS Durban Harbour anti-smuggling unit and Border Security Crime Intelligence following a long term investigation.Hawks spokesperson Cpt Simphiwe Mhlongo said they seized the goods and manufacturing equipment but no arrests have been made yet. The owner of the company will be summoned to appear in the Durban Specialised Commercial Court to face charges of contravention of the Counterfeit Goods Act 37 of 1997, he said.Mhlongo also said a Nike brand protection manager was at the scene to identify their brand and assist in confirming that the goods manufactured at the plant were fake.Nike spokesperson Seruscka Naidoo confirmed they had worked closely with the police to eliminate the growing number of counterfeit products. Nike has a zero tolerance policy against counterfeiting. Not only are they supporting criminal organisations and illegal trade, they are also purchasing counterfeit products that are potentially harmful, as these products are manufactured from sub-standard and toxic materials, Naidoo said.In June, the Hawks closed down a counterfeit factory in the Durban CBD following a complaint from Nike about street vendors selling their brand.Mhlongo said the information led them to a building that was then searched on June 28. Counterfeit goods including Nike, Puma, Vans, Levis, Adidas and Roxy branded clothing valued at about R900000 were seized, Mhlongo said.SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULO
