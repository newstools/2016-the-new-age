GAUTENG leads the list of the Miss SA 2017 top 26 finalists, with 14 beauties representing the province. The second biggest number of young ladies running for the coveted top-12 spot of South Africa’s biggest beauty pageant comes from the Western Cape, with seven beauty queens making up the list.  KwaZulu-Natal comes in at a distant third with only three young beauties. Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, and Limpopo are all on the same footing with one contestant each. The announcment was made yesterday by Sun International, organiser and custodian of the pageant. The list boasts a medical doctor, speech therapist, several law students, a student about to qualify as an engineer, an owner of a construction company and a newsreader at Soweto TV. Two contestants are Miss South Africa finalists who placed in the top 12 in 2014 and 2015, one of whom was awarded her Protea colours in rhythmic gymnastics at the age of 13 and was a gold medal winner at the All African Championships. Football is represented by Jessica Tovey from Randpark Ridge, Johannesburg, who is the daughter of legendary former Bafana Bafana captain Neil Tovey. The pageant’s spokesperson, Claudia Henkel, said all the finalists came from diverse communities.
