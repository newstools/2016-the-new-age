The North West education and sport development department handed over newly renovated buildings at Micha-Kgasi Secondary School in Kgabalatsane village near Brits.The renovations were done at a cost of R12m as part of improving teaching and learning conditions in the area.Education and sport development MEC Sello Lehari handed over the renovated buildings on Saturday.The school was built in 1967 through the initiative of the communities of Hebron, Rabokala and Kgabalatsane villages.Each household in the three villages contributed R5 towards the school building fund. The school was named after the first teacher in the community of Kgabalatsane and builders provided their building services free of charge.The school has produced prominent people who are contributing to the economy of the country.Some of them are Leslie Sedibe, the former CEO of South African Football Association and presently the CEO of Proudly South African and Philimon Kotsokoane, a director of information and communication technology at the education and sport development department.The renovations were done on the administration block, computer laboratory, car park, paving, 18 classrooms, toilets, eight mobile classrooms, library and the roof for the whole school.In the past three years, Micha-Kgasi has obtained more than an 85% pass rate in the matric results.School governing body chairperson, Matshidiso Moatlhodi thanked the department and challenged pupils and teachers to do their best. To pupils and teachers of our school, the department has delivered on renovation. Therefore we do not have any excuse to hide behind the schools buildings, all we are targeting is a 100% pass rate, Moatlhodi said.Segomotso Kungwane, a Grade 11 pupil and a representative council of learners (RCL) member said the renovations would help them to achieve their dreams of completing matric with flying colours.In his remarks, MEC Lehari strongly condemned the destruction and burning down of public property happening in other communities. We came to celebrate the good work done by the caring government of the people. This celebration comes at a time when other communities in our country continue to burn down schools to address challenges in their communities. In other areas communities prevent pupils from going to school to receive their constitutional right, which is the right to education, he said. I want to commend the parents and the community of Kgabalatsane at large who decided to appreciate the good gesture of the government. The department has spent R12m to renovate the school, this is done to ensure that learning and teaching happens in a safe and conducive environment at all times. As the government of Bokone Bophirima, we strongly condemn the destruction and burning down of public property because these buildings are intended to benefit the future generations the MEC said.Lehari wished the best to all pupils sitting for their matric examinations later this month.Elfas Toreraiefast@thenewage.co.za
