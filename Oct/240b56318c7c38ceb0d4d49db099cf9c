Women&#8217;s tennis has entered a new era no longer dominated by Serena Williams, 18-time Grand Slam winner Chris Evert said Saturday.&#8220;I don&#8217;t think nobody will dominate in the near future anyway like Serena Williams, and kudos to her, it shows how great she was as a player, but I think now this is how we&#8217;re going to form some new rivalry where the girls will have to play it out,&#8221; she said at the WTA Finals in Singapore.&#8220;We&#8217;re going to see new winners every single week, different winners every single week. The variety and depth, different age groups, different styles of play, so I think we&#8217;re entering a new era,&#8221; Evert told reporters at a joint press conference with fellow legend Martina Navratilova.The elite season-ending competition has been the most evenly matched in recent history with American powerhouse Williams skipping the event due to a shoulder injury and Russian Maria Sharapova still serving out a doping suspension for the banned medication meldonium.Navratilova, who also won 18 singles Grand Slams in her career, said it was &#8220;not quite&#8221; a changing of the guard but that the game is now much closer &#8212; though players still need to watch out for when Williams returns.&#8220;There&#8217;s a saying that when you injure a king, you have to make sure to kill [him] because they have a habit of coming back,&#8221; she said with a laugh.Asked about Sharapova&#8217;s return next year, Navratilova said: &#8220;Well she didn&#8217;t dominate when she was playing but top four, absolutely.&#8221;She defended Sharapova over her doping ban, pointing out that meldonium was a drug that had been allowed for many years.&#8220;It was pretty clear that she wasn&#8217;t meaning to cheat as I&#8217;ve said many times before. She took a drug that was legal for so many years&#8230;&#8220;The price that she&#8217;s paid and is still paying is bigger than her mistake but that&#8217;s how it goes. Now she has an opportunity to come back,&#8221; Navratilova added.AFP
