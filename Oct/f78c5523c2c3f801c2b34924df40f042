The department of basic education in the Eastern Cape said it took all the necessary steps to ensure that pupils were ready for the matric examinations which started yesterday across the province.Eastern Cape was the worst performing province last year with a pass rate of 56.8% and it is expecting an improved performance with the goal of reaching a 70% pass rate.Eastern Cape s poor performance of last year played a significant role in the decline in the national pass rate to 70.7% which prompted Minister Angie Motshekga to demand progress.Speaking yesterday as the pupils and teachers got down to work, education spokesperson Malibongwe Mtima said they hoped that the efforts of the department would bear fruit with an improved percentage. As a department we have taken all the required steps to equip both teachers and pupils to be ready, to manage and execute this last push. The department has fast-tracked the appointment of teachers like no other year before. The distribution of hybrid supplementary materials to support teaching and learning has been extended to even those schools that performed above 60% as long as they were between quintile 1 and 3, he said.Pupils started exams with computer applications tech P1 practical and they continue today with information technology P1.Cyriac Zacharias, who is a teacher at Holy Cross Education Centre said he expected today s paper to be similar to that of last year.Zacharias said that eight of his pupils last year got level 7 with three getting level 6 and that he was confident that they will make him proud. IT is a subject that requires the use of a computer and the school once experienced challenges like power failure but luckily they had generators on standby. We are ready, there will be no disruptions and we have a generator on standby, he said.Sanelisiwe Mhambi, who is a matriculant at Holy Cross Education Centre, said she was ready for the final examinations because they were given enough time to practice in the computer lab. All computers are working properly and there is a generator that is always on standby to make sure that if there is a power failure we continue with our exams, Mhambi said.The department confirmed that the number of full-time pupils who are registered to write the exams this year increased from 91810 to 94928 and they will be using 18 marking centres around the province.Mtima said marking would start on November 28 and 30 and would be finalised on December 15 and selection of markers was already taking place with verification processes at school and district level.All staff working with the national question papers had signed a confidentiality agreement which barred them from disclosing any information in the papers.Indiphile Boyceprovinces@thenewage.co.za
