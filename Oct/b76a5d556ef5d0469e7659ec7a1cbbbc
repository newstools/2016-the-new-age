Nevondwe allegedly masqueraded as a prosecutor and promised a man arrested for intimidation that he could withdraw the case if he paid him R500. The victim allegedly gave the suspect R300 and the case was indeed withdrawn. The victim then informed the Hawks and on October 27 the alleged prosecutor was arrested after receiving the outstanding R200 from the victim, Hawks provincial spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke said.In another development, the Polokwane Magistrate s Court has issued a warrant of arrest against Leon du Preez, 35, for failing to appear in court on charges relating to perjury and defeating the ends of justice.
