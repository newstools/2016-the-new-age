Education MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe and Venda king, Khosikhulu Vho-Toni Mphephu Ramabulana will launch the matric examination countdown campaign at Vuwani community hall in Vhembe today. The campaign is aimed at encouraging different stakeholders including pupils to work even harder in the final preparations for the final examination, provincial education department spokesperson Dr Naledzani Rasila said.Teachers unions, traditional leaders, pastors, politicians and pupil representatives are expected at the event.During the launch, district teams to assist under performing schools would be introduced. The department will also announce a plan for further assistance to the schools. These are the schools that were also assisted through the departmental strategy implemented throughout the year, Rasila said.The choice of venue to hold the event in Vuwani is seen as an attempt to boost the morale of pupils in the area who spent more than three months boycotting classes as violent protests related to municipal borders raged on in the past four months.More than 30 schools were damaged during the violence and several teaching and learning materials went up in smoke.Most pupils in the area are now attending lessons under trees or inside mobile classrooms while plans are under way to rebuild the damaged schools.Some Grade 12 pupils told Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga during her visit to the area last month that despite hot conditions inside mobile classrooms and learning under trees, they were optimistic about passing the final examinations.The final examinations across the country start on October 24 and end on November 29.Montsho Matlalamontshom@thenewage.co.za
