THE Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has vowed to continue pressing charges against people violating the Animal Protection Act by abusing animals particularly donkeys and dogs in various villages.The warning was issued after people watched in disbelief when the SPCA officials rescued two wounded donkeys being used to transport wood for business purposes in Section E, Tweefontein near KwaMhlanga on Friday.The beasts were rescued when the SPCA officials spotted them with serious injuries all over their bodies and pulling the loaded wagon with four men whipping the animals with sjamboks in order to make them move faster on the road to collect wood from the bushes.SPCA inspector Andrew Lekana said they had no choice but to summon a horsebox (trailer transporting the beasts) from their offices in Pretoria after rescuing the animals which were taken for medical treatment due to the serious injuries they had sustained.Lekana said they were concerned because their preliminary investigation also showed that the animals were transporting wood and other goods from the bushes for the entire day without getting water and food.He said such ill-treatment to animals would not be tolerated by the SPCA as it was against the Animal Protection Act. We are compelled to take away the donkeys because the people have violated the Animal Protection Act no 71 of 1962 which does not allow the abuse of animals.The animals were being used for business purposes despite the serious injuries they sustained. The animals will undergo checkups with our vet in order to determine the exact extent of the injuries. The medical report will also play a vital role in supporting the prosecution against the people for violating the act. We are also confident that the rescuing of the animals will serve as a warning to other people still promoting cruelty to animals, Lekana said.He said the donkey cart was also putting the lives of motorists in danger since it did not comply with the traffic rules because it did not have reflector lights. The owner of the donkeys, Popeti Masango admitted that the donkeys were seriously injured and being abused by collecting wood without receiving medical treatment.Masango said the animals were attacked by unknown people. I had four donkeys assisting me to put food on the table and now I am left with only two. This will make my business move slowly. But I have to blame myself for continuing to use the animals while they were wounded and not taking them for medical treatment, he said. francen@thenewage.co.za
