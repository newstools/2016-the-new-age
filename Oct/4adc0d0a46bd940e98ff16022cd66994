Spanish winger Manuel Arana has signed for Brisbane Roar just a week before the start of Australia’s A-League season, the club said on Saturday. Arana, 31, played three seasons in La Liga with Racing Santander and comes to Brisbane after two years playing in Spain’s second division with Mallorca, scoring 10 goals in 52 appearances. “He is a winger with an eye for goal, very versatile and can play anywhere in the front three,” Roar head coach John Aloisi said. Roar kick off the new A-League season at home to Melbourne Victory on Friday. AFP
