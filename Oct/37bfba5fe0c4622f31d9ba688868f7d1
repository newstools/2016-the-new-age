Actors Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon have been tapped to star in an adaptation of Doug Stanton’s book “Horse Soldiers”, to be directed by Nicolai Fuglsig. The story, based on real life events, is a dramatic account of a small band of Special Forces soldiers who secretly entered Afghanistan in the weeks after 9/11 and later rode to war on horses against the Taliban. Adapted for the screen by Peter Craig and Ted Tally, the film is being co-financed by Black Label Media, with Molly Smith, Trent Luckinbill and Thad Luckinbill producing, along with Jerry Bruckheimer and his Jerry Bruckheimer Films banner. Chad Oman will be executive producer. Commenting on the addition of both actors to the cast, Bruckheimer said: “I am so happy that we’re finally getting this great project off the ground with wonderful leading actors, Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon.” (via Deadline) -Relaxnews
