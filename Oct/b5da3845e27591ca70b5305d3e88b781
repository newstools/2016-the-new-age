Cyber criminals are using the names of high profile figures and government departments dealing with procurement to con unsuspecting South Africans.The latest name to be used was Telecommunications and Postal Services Minister Siyabonga Cwele.Cwele s name was used in a fake email announcing that South African students had been awarded 2016 Brics New Development Bank international grants.The email said they had to pay R5000 to complete their registration. However, it remains unclear how many people fell victim to that email.The email came after Department of Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane s name was also used on Facebook to solicit money.Deputy Minister for Telecommunications and Postal Services Hlengiwe Mkhize said cybercriminals were targeting people they deemed financially viable. It s done by sophisticated people with technical knowledge, who research and see who is a financially viable target. They get all the information correct and they put it nicely such that if you re familiar with the person you re able to believe the information supposedly sent by them. They create an opportunity online and send it out, Mkhize said.Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said there were ongoing investigations on a number of cases while others were in court. There are a lot of high profile people used in these scams and we have received several reports. In some cases, we re able to trace the cyber-criminals but in some instances they use an IP address once and close it, making it difficult to track them down, Mulaudzi said.Mthokozisi Dube| mtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
