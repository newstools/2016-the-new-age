The provincial department of education has voiced concern regarding the number of teachers in the province tending their resignations every year.The department has called on teachers to remain committed in their jobs until their retirement in order to encourage upcoming teachers to develop passion in the profession.Education MEC, Reginah Mhaule expressed her dissatisfaction over the resignation of teachers yesterday when she was conveying her message of gratitude to teachers in the province as part of her World Teachers Day celebrations. The celebration was happening under the theme: Valuing teachers, improving their status.Mhaule said the province consisted of a total number of 32 405 teachers and the department was hard at work in bringing enhancement to the culture of learning and teaching. October 5 is an important day on the calendar in the education sector throughout the world and is second to none. Teachers are tasked with the responsibility to empower, mediate knowledge and socialise pupils into fully-fledged, accountable and responsible citizens, Mhaule said.He said religious leaders and other stakeholders needed to cooperate with the department in discouraging the resignation of teachers. The Mpumalanga department of education strongly holds the view that no nation can be developed and sustained without the fundamental service of providing quality education which primarily is offered by teachers. It is thus a disturbing trend that the department notes the high rate of resignations of teachers from the system and thus I am again making a humble plea to our teachers to stay until their retirements are due and I request teacher unions, churches and civil society to join us in making this appeal, Mhaule said.France Nyakafrancen@thenewage.co.za
