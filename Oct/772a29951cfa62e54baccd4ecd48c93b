Lee Westwood has set his sights on being appointed European captain for the 2020 Ryder Cup despite his poor showing in his team&#8217;s recent defeat against the United States.Westwood failed to score a point in three matches at Hazeltine in the most disappointing of his 10 Ryder Cup appearances.The 43-year old Englishman went to the US looking to eclipse Nick Faldo&#8217;s all-time European record scoring feat.But instead Westwood found himself dropped by skipper Darren Clarke after teaming with rookie Thomas Pieters and being handed a 5 &amp; 4 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar in the opening day Foursomes.It was Westwood&#8217;s second biggest defeat since making his Ryder Cup debut in 1997.And as Westwood began preparations for Thursday&#8217;s British Masters at The Grove, just north of London, he revealed his European captaincy aspirations for the 2020 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin.&#8220;I certainly would not want to be captain next time around, as that&#8217;s too soon for me, so I think 2020 is definitely on my radar,&#8221; he said on Wednesday.&#8220;After that, 2022, who knows. There are a lot of candidates for the captaincy but I&#8217;ll be putting my name in the ring for sure. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to do.&#8220;I&#8217;ve played in 10 Ryder Cups and witnessed 10 different forms of captaincy, so I&#8217;m pretty well qualified to be a captain I would have thought.&#8220;I&#8217;ve played in a lot of teams and I&#8217;d like to maybe play again but if I can&#8217;t play again, I&#8217;d like to do the assistant captain&#8217;s role.&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you have to be an assistant captain (first) but it probably helps.It&#8217;s another angle to see it from, more experience.&#8220;And there won&#8217;t be any people that would have played under 10 different captains because there&#8217;s not many who have played 10 Ryder Cups.&#8221;One factor possibly in Westwood&#8217;s favour for 2020 is that his close friend Clarke will be a member of the three-man selection panel that should sit in early 2019 to choose the Whistling Straits captain.The process of electing the 2018 European captain will take place early next year and Denmark&#8217;s Thomas Bjorn, the long-time Chairman of the Tournament Players Committee, is the short-priced favourite for Paris.Sitting on the panel to choose the next European captain will be European Tour CEO Keith Pelley, former European skipper Paul McGinley and Clarke&#8211;APF
