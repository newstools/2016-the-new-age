Premier Stanley Mathabatha wished matriculants preparing to sit for final examinations good luck in their endeavours.Mathabatha said those registered as candidates for the Grade 12 final examinations deserved congratulations for making it this far. He advised them to use the remaining days before their examinations effectively. This is the time to suspend all activities that are not helpful to your studies, including the time spent on social networks. Our hope for the 80% pass rate rests on your shoulders and we are confident you will meet our expectations, he said in a statement.He said the special ingredients to obtain a good pass, which was a master key that opened all doors to opportunities and better life were hard work, focus and discipline. I urge you to always remember the words of our icon, Dr Nelson Mandela, that education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor. The son of a mine worker can become the head of a mine, he said.The premier said the province experienced the worst academic period in the Vuwani area this year when 30 schools were burnt down during violent community protests related to the municipal borders. I am happy that there is determination and hard work on the side of pupils and teachers. The work done in Vuwani so far shows that we have covered enough ground, he said.The province s matric class of 2015 scored 65.9%, well below the 80% provincial target demanded by the premier.Montsho Matlalamontshom@thenewage.co.za
