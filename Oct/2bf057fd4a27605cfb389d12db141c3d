Traditional healers in the North West have elected district leadership committees to care for all practitioners in the province.The committees will serve as a link between the health department and traditional healers.The newly-elected committees will serve for three years, prescribed by the Traditional Health Practitioners Act.The structures will also assist the department to implement African traditional medicine policies and to bring about equal recognition of all traditional health practitioners in the province regardless of their affiliation to different associations.Through the committees, the health department will be able to develop a database for all traditional health practitioners operating within the borders of the province so as to ensure that healthcare services rendered by the traditional health practice are of good quality.The committees have a duty to ensure that traditional health practitioners serve the interest of the public.Newly-elected committee chairperson for Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District, Kentse Esau, said she was honoured to be elected by her colleagues in the district to lead them. It s really an honour for me to be standing here as the chairperson for this newly elected committee. We will work together the with government to bring about changes needed in this area. We will serve you with pride and make sure we restore our dignity as traditional practitioners. Our people need us and they need our services. As the new leadership in the district, we will ensure that all traditional practitioners operating in the borders of this district are registered and operate within the guidelines stipulated in the Traditional Health Practitioners Act (THP) and the Constitution of the republic because our people deserve only the best, she said.Health MEC Dr Magome Masike welcomed the new structures, saying the law required his office to establish these committees. We are happy that we have successfully managed to establish these committees in all four district municipalities as it is required by the THP Act. Our role as a department now is to provide these committees with appropriate resources and guidance to support their functionality. He said every district, through the committees, would elect a provincial traditional health practitioners executive committee before the end of the current financial year.Masike called on those elected to put the sector s interest first and help elevate the importance of traditional medicine.Elfas Toreraielfast@thenewage.co.za
