Trade and Investment Department executive manager for export development and promotion in KZN Lester Bouah has hailed the recent Export Week in Durban a major success.The jam-packed programme with many high-profile speakers was a platform to share insights and advice to existing and emerging exporters. This year s Export Week was exceptionally well attended with participant figures on each day surpassing our expectations in some cases by 50%. There were many highlights from the week, including discussions on the impact of Brexit on provincial exports and investment and insights on Brics with particular focus on China and India, Bouah said.He said panel discussions produced real case studies and discussions around emerging markets in Africa with representatives from the countries of Zimbabwe, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia contributing. But in particular, one big take away from the full week of discussions was the need for our province to really encourage localisation and industrialisation. More manufacturers based in KZN need to investigate the opportunity of not only capitalising on manufacturing raw materials for products but in addition to see how they can be more involved from start to finish in the whole supply chain right down to the assembly of products before they are exported, he said.Bouah and other speakers emphasised that companies need to take a more aggressive interest in localisation. Exporting is crucial to the country s economic health. Yet only a small percentage of potential exporters take advantage of these opportunities.Since the Export Week started five years ago we have seen substantial growth in the interest of emerging exporters who have attended the week, Bouah said.The 2016 Export Week that coincided with African Ports Evolution and African Rail Evolution, also celebrated companies and individuals who have excelled in their fields with awards being presented to winners at the inaugural Women in Transport Awards and the 16th KZN Exporter of the Year awards held at the Durban International Convention Centre.TNA reporter
