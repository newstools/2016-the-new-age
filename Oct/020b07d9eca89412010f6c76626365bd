The National Health, Education and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) will take their war against the crisis in health care to the premier s office today.The union said it organised a march to the offices of the premier to demand a response to their memorandum on the crisis in the province.Last Thursday, Nehawu picketed outside Kimberley hospital to remind management of their demands.The branch secretary of Nehawu s health cluster, Moleme Moleme, said: The employer has remained rigid with no movement, thus we are taking it up to the premier to recall the head of department and her team. We expect 1000 members to become part of our March. Moleme said they wanted the release of the corruption task team report, the absorption of employees in government and the reasons for appointment of social development employees in the health department.The corruption task team was formed by former health MEC Mac Jack who listed flawed lease agreements, undeclared employee interests and fraudulent procurement of equipment and supplies as some of the corrupt activities uncovered by the Northern Cape health department.The team investigated R200m worth of corruption-related activities but the new health MEC, Lebogang Motlhaping, has yet to release the report.A new HOD, Elizabeth Botes, was appointed in an effort to change things around at the health department.Botes will assist the department in paying R300m worth of debt tosuppliers.Premier Lucas said they wanted a clear-cut turnaround strategy for the department of health.Despite attempts by the department to get to the bottom of things, workers think that things are getting worse.Moleme said in addition to the corruption task team report, they wanted the reasons for the appointment of staff from the department of social development.He said interviews were not conducted most of the employees have been appointed on higher salary notches.Moleme said the department tells them about cost containment measures but still has the audacity to appoint more staff members.Staff in the supply chain, corporate services and the finance departments were being replaced and those currently occupying the positions were moved to other directorates within the department. There is absolutely no accountability in the department and we believe corruption will never stop. It s deliberate, Moleme said.He claimed that anyone can procure the signature of the head of department and payments can be executed without authorisation from management.In her response, the head of ministry in the department Phumza Mdibe said they will respond to the memorandum of understanding within the prescribed seven days. We are happy you have taken this march in a peaceful and dignified manner. I will direct the memorandum to all relevant parties and we will respond to the issues that you have outlined, Mdibe said.Nomusa Mvubunomusam@thenewage.co.za
