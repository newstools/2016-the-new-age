An ex employee at the store owned by Christopher Panayiotou told the court on Thursday that a week prior to Jayde Panayiotou s disappearance he saw R30k in the storeroom.Mawonga Ndedwa, who worked at the OK Grocer owned by Panayiotou, told the court that he went to the police after reading an article that stated the police were looking for the owner of a cellphone number, which belonged to him. The state was looking for that number. I decided to stop working at OK and informed the police that it&#8217;s my number, Ndedwa said.According to his testimony, Panayiotou used his phone two weeks before Jayde Panayiotou went missing. Panayiotou allegedly used the phone to call co-accused , turned state witness Luthando Siyoni.Ndedwa said the accused gave him R1000 to buy himself a new phone because his phone would lead the police to him.Terry Price for Panayiotou, states that Ndedwa is misleading the court as he was fired from OK for stealing 11 bottles of Whiskey.However Ndedwa claims he wanted to get himself fired so that he could still benefit from UIF. Before of these 16 disciplinary charges, you weren t a good employee,&#8221; said Price.Price told the court regardless of Ndedwa s behaviour, Panayiotou treated him well and only 12 days after he was fired did he go to the police to give a statement.Meanwhile, Nedbank account manager Estelle Burger on Wednesday explained why there were 14 calls between her and murder accused Christopher Panayiotou on the day Jayde Panayiotou went missing.According to Burger, she received a phone call from Panayiotou to find out if there were movements on his wife s account. He wanted to establish transactions on Jayde s account. I told him I can t tell him because he does not have proxy,&#8221; said Burger.Burger claims she did not know what was happening when Panayiotou called and she was in no position to assist him. She said she mentioned this to Panayiotou, who later called her again. He phoned me again later that day and I explained again why I can t assist,&#8221; she said.However Burger later made six calls to Panayiotou in which she claims she wanted to find out if they found his wife.Terry Price for Panayiotou stated that Burger did give Panayiotou information but was avoiding the questions so she does not get into trouble with the bank.The defence went out of its way to question the credibility of Mawonga Ndedwa s testimony.According Price, Ndedwa wanted to use the information about the phone as leverage against Fanoula Panayiotou, the mother of accused Christopher Panayiotou.Ndedwa reportedly wanted R150k from the Panayiotou s or he would go to court but he claims that someone who works at Infinity club went to the police to report the phone issue.The way Ndedwa is sidestepping questions will not act in his favour when the court rules on his credibility, said Price.Witness Ndedwa says he called Fanoula to find out what she said to the police so that he could know what to say. He claims he wanted to prove his innocence as he believes Panayiotou used his phone to plot his wife s murder.The trial continue at the Port Elizabeth magistrate court on Friday. -TNA Reporter
