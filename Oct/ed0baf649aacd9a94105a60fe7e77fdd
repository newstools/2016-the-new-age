National SAPS golf champion Capt Mongezi Nkopane has been praised as a good example to his colleagues and members of the public in Ficksburg.Nkopane is rated the best police golf player in the country after out-performing his competitors during the recent championships in Port Elizabeth. Ficksburg acting cluster commander Col Isaac Francis acknowledged the support that colleagues gave to Nkopane because of the hard work that he put into his preparations. At the same time, Francis also urged policewomen to take an interest in sport and especially golf so that in future they represent the cluster. We have a champion in the house and what else do we need, we need women as well to participate and learn the tactics from the champ on how to be a champion. We say well done our champ because you have made us proud and you have put the cluster on the map. Continue working hard on the game you love and keep on bringing home more medals, Francis said.Nkopane, who is stationed at Ficksburg port of entry on the border, was welcomed by his colleagues at a packed detective conference hall last week. I am honoured that my colleagues took time from their schedules to welcome me back to work and I want to thank everyone for the support and the good messages while I was at the tournament, Nkopane said. I do not only play golf for the SAPS, even during my spare time I take part in tournaments where sometimes I do well by winning. I am happy that I have made my cluster and the police force proud and I will continue working hard so that I try to bring success home. I also hope that this will influence other people, especially the young ones, because they tend to focus on the wrong things that lead them into doing bad. Nkopane has won numerous tournaments and said he aimed to continue doing so.beckers@thenewage.co.za
