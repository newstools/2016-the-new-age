The app store for HTC’s virtual reality headset Vive launches online across the world on Friday reports The Verge. After opening exclusively in China earlier this year, the app store Viveport launched in 30 countries across the globe Friday. At the moment HTC Vive owners can use Steam to buy and run apps and games, or download them from third-party services such Itch.io. However Viveport is expected to make it easier for non-gaming experiences to get noticed. To celebrate, several Vive titles will be discounted to just $1 for 48 hours, including a new version of Wevr’s “theBlu,” “The Music Room Mini,” “Mars Odyssey,” “Firebird – La Peri,” and “Stonehenge VR.”
