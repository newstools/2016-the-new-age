THE PROTEAS arrived in Durban yesterday for the third ODI against Australia tomorrow at Kingsmead Stadium with its think tank grappling with the Hashim Amla quandary. The No 3 ODI-ranked batsman missed the opening two matches against the Aussies in Centurion on Friday and Johannesburg on Sunday and it is anyone’s guess if he will play tomorrow. The Proteas could wrap up the series with two matches to spare – in Port Elizabeth on Sunday and Cape Town next Wednesday – if they defeat Australia in Durban. Asked about the decision to leave Amla out of the team in the second ODI in Johannesburg, skipper Faf du Plessis said the decision was made by the selectors. “The selectors made that decision,” Du Plessis said. “They wanted to keep the same team from last Friday. Obviously for me Hash (Amla) is one of the best players in the world. There was nothing I could do about that. Hashim averages 52 in ODIs, so for me you can never replace that.” In Centurion, Quinton de Kock opened the batting with Rilee Rossouw and they put together a first wicket partnership of 145 runs with De Kock contributing 81 and his partner 63. De Kock went on to score 178, falling 11 runs shy of setting the new record for the highest individual ODI score for the Proteas, set by Gary Kirsten. In the second match, their partnership was not that successful as they only managed to contribute 70 runs on the scoreboard, with De Kock adding 22 runs and Rossouw 48. Rossouw went on to score 75 which went a long way to helping the Proteas to a 142-run victory in the Bullring. mahlatsem@thenewage.co.za -Mmasekepe Matsebane
