The provincial department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs has given its assurance to continue strengthening its cooperation with municipalities in order to speed up the provision of viable services as expected from the local government sector.The department made the assurance after being conferred with a clean administration award by the Chartered Institute of Government Finance, Audit &amp; Risk Officers during a conference in Durban last week. According to the cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC, Refilwe Mtshweni, the accolade was presented to the department in appreciation of its sustained support from municipalities.Mtshweni said her department was also recognised as the country s leading provincial department supporting the internal audit, risk and performance management efforts. She said she was glad because the accomplishment became possible as a result of the tireless efforts of her staff as part of their dedication and commitment to moving the local government forward. We have been awarded the clean administration award by the Chartered Institute of Government Finance, Audit &amp; Risk Officers in recognition of the department s continued support for municipalities. This award reflects a well-oiled organisation of a committed support staff led by the head of department. It signifies the department s commitment to support municipalities as expressed in the integrated municipal support plan. We have no doubt that the award will further propel the department to do more in pursuit of the vision to establish a responsive, accountable, effective and efficient local government system, Mtshweni said.She said the award came at the right time because it attested to other accolades received by the department from the auditor general. The award is the second accolade bestowed on the department from the auditor general after achieving clean audits for two successive years. France Nyakafrancen@thenewage.co.za
