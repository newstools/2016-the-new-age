The party adopted the policy at its 2014 conference held at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein. The EFF would establish a solidarity fund used to pay bail for its members who got charged for land grabs, said party president Malema at the time. Malema is scheduled to appear in the Newcastle regional court on 7 November and Bloemfontein court on 14 November. -TNA Reporter
