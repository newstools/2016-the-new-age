A KZN father is livid with the Durban University of Technology (DUT) following the university s decision to trim down a radiography course.The university says it has not scrapped the course but due to low subscriptions the course will not be offered every year.Lina Puckree, executive dean at the Faculty for Health Sciences, said: The course has not been scrapped but due to poor subscription, the programme will not be offered every year. But Rashid Patel insists there are other options that can be explored by the university to ensure that students who want to pursue the course are not prejudiced.Patel, whose daughter has applied to study radiography at the university, said he had been battling the issue for a year. He is lobbying for the university to extend the radiography course to Pietermaritzburg to help more students attend the course. If there are 500 students and 70 seats available, will you turn away so many? The reality is, if you have so many students and many of them qualify, why not split the course and offer half in Pietermaritzburg? Patel said.He said DUT could then share lecturers and infrastructure. They could also get the private sector, including hospitals, as partners to offer their theatres and X-ray machines for the benefit of students.Patel has sent emails to the university pleading with them to revisit their decision as it impacts on the cost of education for poor students who, he says, have to travel to Durban to study.Puckree said: This has been under discussion which is ongoing. Patel said he was not only fighting for his daughter but for countless others. Why should children who are based in the Natal Midlands and areas like Estcourt, Pietermaritzburg and Ladysmith have to go to Durban? Patel said.DUT is the only university in the province that offers radiology. No higher education institution is allowed to offer a course if it is not accredited to do so.LERATO DIALE
