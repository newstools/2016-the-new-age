People who have lodged claims or need compensation from the Road Accident Fund (RAF) should gather at Nkowankowa Community Hall outside Tzaneen on Saturday.The RAF s visit is part of its on the road outreach campaign aimed at meeting the claimants. We are making a difference to claimants and everyone affected by the carnage on South Africa s roads, RAF spokesperson Linda Rulashe said. On the day, claimants are also educated about the RAF, given settlement offers, assisted with enquiries and provided support to rehabilitate survivors of vehicle crashes. Rulashe said a legacy of funding and legal challenges caused by the RAF s fault-based compensation system continued to negatively impact the organisation, but the fund remained committed to delivering services countrywide. The Department of Transport s proposed no-fault road accident benefit scheme is meant to address these problems, providing benefits to all accident victims and their dependants irrespective of who was at fault, she said.Before the main event in Nkowankowa on Saturday, the RAF will start with road safety awareness in the area tomorrow to inform people about the dangers of unrestrained minors in vehicles. The fund will donate 20 car seats to mothers of newborn babies at Letaba Hospital tomorrow, Rulashe said.Montsho Matlalamontshom@thenewage.co.za
