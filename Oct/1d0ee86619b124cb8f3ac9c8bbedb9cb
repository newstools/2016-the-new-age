South Africa s education fraternity is in mourning following the death of the Congress of South African Students (Cosas) first female president, Sandra Baloyi.Baloyi, who served as Cosas president from 2014 to 2015, died at the weekend after a short illness.She was born in 1995 in Tzaneen, Limpopo and began her political career while a pupil at Moleketla Primary School.Cosas president Zama Khanyase said the death of Baloyi had left the movement in pain and confusion as the young are the future of this country . The students movement acknowledges the contribution that president Baloyi had in the growth of the organisation during her tenure. President Baloyi delivered on the mandate of students, she said.Khanyase said Baloyi died as a child of the student movement and her life should be celebrated. Being the first female president of Cosas her name will always be highlighted in the history books of the student s movement and shall inspire the entire female membership of Cosas to push forward the struggle against patriarchy and exclusion of women based merely on their gender, she said.Basic Education Ministe Angie Motshekga said Baloyi was passionate about women s rights and politics and her short life was testament to that. She said her death came as a shock to her office as they had worked on a number of projects with Cosas over the years. She was an exuberant young leader, she had an aura of maturity that was well beyond her years. Her death is a great loss to the organisation and as a country we have sadly also lost one of our bright young stars, Motshekga said.Cosas has announced that it will hold several memorial services across the country later in the week.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
