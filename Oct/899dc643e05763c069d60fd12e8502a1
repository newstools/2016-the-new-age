Health services in the province have received a major boost as four medical doctors qualified as specialists in the fields of radiology, forensic pathology, paediatrics and paediatric pulmonology respectively. Dr Makoma Moremi who qualified in paediatric pulmonology is the only specialist to have passed the exam in this particular field countrywide, provincial health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba said. Paediatric pulmonology is one of the government s priorities, therefore having specialists in this area will be a major boost in our quest to provide quality mother-and-child healthcare services, Ramathuba said.Dr Pamela Mashego specialises in paediatrics, Dr Machuene Hlahla in forensic pathology while Dr Matseliso Gugushe has qualified as a specialist in radiology.Ramathuba said: These specialists have made it against the odds if we note that they are from a rural province and that is the reason we are celebrating. We congratulate the team on this great achievement. They must know that they have done us proud as the province. Their specialised qualifications would further help to capacitate other key role players in the critical chain of quality health care services.According to the department, the achievement of the four doctors should bring confidence to the people of the province not only in health service delivery but also because of the realisation of a dream to create the first Limpopo medical school.The new medical school, the ninth in the country and the first to be established under a democratic government, has enrolled the first batch of 60 students to study for bachelor of medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) programmes at the University of Limpopo.Montsho Matlalamontshom@thenewage.co.za
