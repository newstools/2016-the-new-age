Imran Tahir has been fined 30% of his match fee by the International Cricket Council after a heated exchange with Australian David Warner during the fifth ODI in Cape Town. The fine is accompanied by two demerit points on his disciplinary record. Tahir should be careful from now, if he reaches four or more demerit points in the next 24 months, it will be converted into two suspension points which will mean a ban from future matches. The player was accused of lacking respect for umpires after being reprimanded on his verbal exchange with Aussie batsman David Warner. This was seen as against the spirit of the game. The Proteas were also fined for maintaining a slow over-rate. The team was said to have broken Article 2.5.1 of the ICC code of Conduct, relating to minor over-rate offences. It was ruled that the Proteas were one over short of the teams target when time allowance which includes treatment given to a player; all third umpire referrals and consultations; time wasting by the batting side and two minutes per wicket taken. Faf Du Plessis was fined 20% of his match fee as Captain and the rest of the team fined 10%. Tahir and Du Plessis pleaded guilty to the offences accepting, proposed sanctions by Chris Broad of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees. Meanwhile Former Australia captain Mark Taylor says six spots are contestable in the national team ahead of the first Test against South Africa next month. Taylor claimed only five members of the current Test side, which went down 3-0 in Sri Lanka in September, were assured of their places against the Proteas in Perth from November 3-7. “The people who pick themselves at the moment are David Warner, Steve Smith, Peter Nevill, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and I think everyone else at this stage will be talked about,” he told Cricket Australia’s website late on Thursday. “I don’t think there’s anyone else who’s absolutely penned in at the moment,” he said.
