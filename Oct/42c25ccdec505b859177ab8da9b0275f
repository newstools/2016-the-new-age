CONTROVERSY prone veteran radio man Phat Joe will soon be honoured with the keys to the city of Ethekwini who have welcomed the former Metro FM radio host with open arms. Phat Joe recently joined KwaZulu-Natal commercial radio station, East Coast Radio after yet another fall out with his employers at the public broadcaster almost two months ago. The handover ceremony which was meant to take place today was moved after mayor Zandile Gumede’s schedule could not accommodate the ceremony, the station’s spokesperson Anisa Ussuph said in a statement announcing the postponement of the event. She said the publicised handover would still take place at the station’s offices in Umhlanga, Durban at a later date. “Unfortunately this handover is not taking place on Monday due to a diary clash. I will let you know when the mayor is next available for the handover,” she said. Barely two weeks after relocating to KZN and assuming his duties as the new host of East Coast Drive, the man born Majota Kambule was accused by a section of the station’s listeners for being “sexist and making racist comments on air”. The accusations were followed by an online petition. Last month, the station even appeared in front of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. –SIYABONGA SITHOLE
