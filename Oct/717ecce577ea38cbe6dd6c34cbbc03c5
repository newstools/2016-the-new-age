Thirty-five University of Western Cape students have been denied bail at the Bellville Magistrates Court on Friday.The court concluded that the case should be postponed to 28 October 2016, as the students will be held at Pollsmoor Prison.Students were arrested on Wednesday amid clashes with police.&#8220;Regrettably, protest action escalated yesterday on the main campus. Several buildings were set alight and incidences of lootings and damage to property were reported. Confrontations between police and students were also reported and some students were taken into police custody,&#8221; said UWC.The state conceded that it needs seven days for more information and asked for remand of the case for next Friday to make a decision on whether students qualify for bail.During that time, the state will have to obtain the necessary information to determine if they will in fact oppose bail, and if they gather enough evidence for bail profile then they can release them early next week.&#8220;Calling on all of civil society to assist us. Arrested students need places to stay as bail conditions might result in students to find accommodation off campus,&#8221; said UWC Fees Will Fall movement on Facebook.Meanwhile, the University of the Western Cape (UWC) students have been given the choice to write their final exams next month (November) or in January 2017.On Wednesday, violent protests erupted with petrol bombs found, canteens were looted and a case of arson was reported at a residence.On Thursday, management suspended all face-to-face lectures for the rest of the academic year.Students are scheduled to meet at ResLife at 1pm.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale
