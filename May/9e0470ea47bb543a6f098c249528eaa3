One Ukrainian coal miner was killed and at least nine others were missing, feared dead on Wednesday after a methane gas explosion at a mine in the war-scarred separatist east.The chief health official of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People&#8217;s Republic said 20 workers were inside the mine when the blast occurred on Tuesday in an area some 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of the Russian border.&#8220;Four are in hospital getting treatment for burns. We recovered one body and nine are still under the rubble,&#8221; Larisa Airapetyan told the official Lugansk separatists&#8217; news site.&#8220;The chances of finding them alive are slim &#8212; the gas accumulation is very high.&#8221;She did not say how or when the other six miners were rescued.The head of the rebel region&#8217;s police force said the mine had earlier been stripped of its operating license due to safety concerns.&#8220;We issued instructions to shut down this facility, but no one listened to us,&#8221; the Lugansk news site quoted police chief Igor Kornet as saying.Local officials said the blast occurred 210 metres (690 feet) below ground.Lugansk&#8217;s separatist leader Igor Plotnitsky said on Wednesday that he had issued orders to conduct &#8220;the strictest inspections possible&#8221; of all mines in the resource-rich region to prevent further accidents.The former Soviet republic&#8217;s rust belt has suffered from repeated deadly blasts in its loss-making, poorly-maintained coal mines.Another methane gas build up in an accident-prone mine in the rebel-held city of Donetsk killed 32 people in March 2015.Mine safety has been hampered further by a two-year insurgency that has claimed the lives of more than 9,300 people and left few resources for crucial maintenance work.-AFP
