In the process the minibus lost control and overturned killing four males and seriously injuring two women.Preliminary investigation indicate the minibus belong to the police constable who was driving when it crashed, Mojapelo said. The police officer s next of kin at Tafelkop have been informed but for now we withhold his name because he is a suspect in the attempted car hijacking, police spokesperson said.The alleged targeted VW sedan was not involved in the crash and the owner proceeded to the Motetema police station to report a case of attempted hijacking, police said.Launching the safe festive season campaign recently, Premier Stan Mathabatha warned police officers not to get involved in criminal activities and show no mercy to law offenders.montshom@thenewageMONTSHO MATLALA
