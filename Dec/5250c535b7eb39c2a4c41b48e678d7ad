As road users gear up for the festive season traffic build up, it has emerged that Gauteng remains one of the top three provinces in terms of fatality rates during the festive period with pedestrians being at the highest risk of death.Almost half (49.1%) of the road fatalities in the province in the past year involved pedestrians, followed by passenger fatalities at 26.3% and driver fatalities at 19.6%. This was revealed by Transport Minister Dipuo Peters during the launch of the festive season campaign 2016 at Eldorado Park.She said in the past two years the area from the Naturena Interchange up to Impala Road had a total of 43 crashes leading to fatalities of 30 pedestrians, 11 drivers and four passengers.A World Bank study on road crashes of 2013, estimated that globally some 1.3 million people die on roads every year, and up to 50 million suffer injuries.In SA, the Road Traffic Management Corporation recorded 12944 road fatalities for 2015. More than 80% of these road crashes were caused by human factors, especially over weekends and at night when our law enforcement officers are not on duty due to conditions of employment, Peters said.Former president Nelson Mandela s daughter, Zoleka s words at the launch of her late daughter Zenani Mandela Road Safety Scholarship, were a timely reminder to all road users of the devastation caused by road accidents. A crash robbed me of my daughter, a beautiful, bright 13 year old who was full of energy and hope for the future. I will never recover from this but what makes this even worse is that so often road accidents are preventable, she said.The recent publication on the 2015 Cost of Road Traffic Crashes in South Africa report released by the RTMC in collaboration with Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) confirmed road fatalities cost the nation about R143bn, which is equivalent to 3% of the GDP.During this period, the department will continue with the enforcement of regulations compelling passengers in motor vehicles to wear seat belts and drivers to ensure that children under the age of three years are placed in car seats or child restraints whenever they are transported on public roads.NONDUMISO ZWANE
