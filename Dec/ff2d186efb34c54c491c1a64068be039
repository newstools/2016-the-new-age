Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino hailed his side&#8217;s 5-0 win over Swansea in the Premier League as a &#8220;big victory&#8221;.Two goals from Harry Kane, a stunning volley from Heung-Min Son and two late efforts for Christian Eriksen ensured Spurs reacted in the best possible way to defeats by Monaco and leaders Chelsea to remain within seven points of their London rivals.&#8220;I think we fully deserved the result,&#8221; said Pochettino. &#8220;We dominated and played well. They didn&#8217;t shoot and they didn&#8217;t create chances.&#8220;It was a very good performance, the complete one. I&#8217;m happy and we needed it &#8212; a big victory after Chelsea (they lost 2-1 after going 1-0 up).&#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe it was the best performance of the season. Against Manchester City we were better. It&#8217;s important to be close to the top.&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased with the performance, it was fantastic. Credit to the players.&#8221;Kane now has six goals in five since returning from an ankle problem while he also put pen to paper on a new five-and-a-half year contract this week.&#8220;I feel after his (Kane) injury it was good for him to work with consistency and I think that the last week was important for his to work on his fitness,&#8221; said Pochettino.The Argentine manager was also delighted with the performance of Dele Alli who was involved in four goals but also in a controversial moment as he went down easily following a challenge by Kyle Naughton for the 39th-minute penalty opener that Kane converted. I&#8217;m happy with him (Alli) &#8212; he has recovered the feeling of last season,&#8221; said Pochettino.&#8220;He&#8217;s young and needs to find his best and be consistent &#8212; that&#8217;s the challenge for him. But I did not see the incident for the penalty, it was too difficult to see.&#8220;After 5-0 and 23 or 24 shots and zero from Swansea it is not important to talk about the penalty. We can&#8217;t focus on that, it is a waste of time.&#8220;In the second half we were much better. We need to prepare for the next game against CSKA but it is important to get the three points to be closer to the top.&#8221;His Swansea counterpart Bob Bradley was upset by referee Jon Moss call.&#8220;I think it was the wrong decision &#8212; the referee wasn&#8217;t in a very good position,&#8221; he said.&#8220;It was a game changer. If you add on Son&#8217;s strike a few minutes later the task becomes so much greater.&#8221;This was a disappointing showing by Swansea following an impressive 5-4 win over Crystal Palace last week and Bradley is in no doubt at the size of his task with the South Wales side in the bottom three. We were second best too often,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When they pressed us we weren&#8217;t able to played the first pass out of pressure.&#8220;We knew it would be hard to take points and we have to focus on an important run of games between now and next year.&#8220;Today is a big concern. I think the starting point was Tottenham, physically, got to every ball faster. On a day like today it feels like we have a long, long way to go.&#8220;There have been other days where I think there have been promising signs. We have work to do.&#8221;-AFP
