THE ANC in the province has wished people a happy festive season and also expressed appreciation for continuing support. The August 3 local government elections provided us as the ANC an opportunity to confirm that the majority of citizens continue to place their future hopes in our capacity to be the best custodians of their needs and aspiration.We remain forever humbled by this affirmation, says party provincial secretary Nocks Seabi. Seabi said that the majority of South Africans worked hard throughout 2016 and it was time to take their deserved rest while also urging those who would be travelling not to drink and drive and to obey the road rules. The festive season comes as the world celebrates the lives of two giants of humanity, Presidents Nelson Mandela and Fidel Castro.As we celebrate we should allow our conscience to remain in the tutelage of their towering humanity, he said. The ANC said it was confident that the Grade 12 class of 2016 would perform well and congratulated them in advance. We also extend our congratulations to all our social, cultural and sporting heroes who made our province and the nation proud through their excellence. It is our hope that this festive season will be enjoyable and fulfilling, said the provincial secretary.montshom@thenewage.co.zaMONTSHO MATLALA
