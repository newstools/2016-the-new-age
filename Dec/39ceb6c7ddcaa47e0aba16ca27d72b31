Yet her fans&#8217; hearts may have skipped a beat today when tweets purportedly from Sony Music Entertainment said &#8220;RIP @britneyspears #RIPBritney 1981-2016&#8221; and &#8220;Britney spears is dead by accident! We will tell you more soon #RIPBritney.&#8221;The real Sony Music Entertainment quickly deleted those tweets and issued a terse clarification:&#8220;Sony Music Entertainment&#8217;s Twitter account was compromised. This has been rectified,&#8221; it said. &#8220;Sony Music apologizes to Britney Spears and her fans for any confusion.&#8221;Spears&#8217;s manager, Adam Leber, told CNN that &#8220;Britney is fine and well.&#8221;She had posted photos on Sunday of her children in camouflage gear during an outdoors excursion.&#8220;There have been a few Internet clowns over the years who have made similar claims about her death,&#8221; Leber said, &#8220;but never from the official Sony Music Twitter account.&#8221;In 2001, a Texas radio station reported that Spears and then-boyfriend Justin Timberlake had died in a car crash. Two on-air personalities were later fired for repeating bogus Internet reports.In addition to Sony&#8217;s Twitter account, the official account of Bob Dylan may have been hacked on Monday: It tweeted: &#8220;Rest in peace @britneyspears&#8221; about the same time as the fake Sony tweets were going out.While the origin of the erroneous tweets was not certain, the hacker group OurMine was a prime suspect. One tweet from Dylan&#8217;s account included the OurMine hashtag.The group has hacked the accounts of other celebrities &#8212; including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg &#8212; as well as those of Netflix, Marvel and Variety magazine.It has then offered to provide its own security services to prevent future attacks.Buzzfeed News reported in October that OurMine is a Saudi teenager who goes by the name &#8220;Ahmad Makki&#8221; on social media.OurMine, however, said &#8220;Makki&#8221; was simply a fan. But Buzzfeed&#8217;s website was then compromised and several posts were altered to read &#8220;Hacked by OurMine.&#8221;The latest episode was reminiscent of the massive cyberattack against Sony in November 2014.A hacking group known as GOP had penetrated the Japanese company&#8217;s computer system and seized personal data about thousands of its employees, including stars.GOP then demanded that the studio cancel all showings of &#8220;The Interview,&#8221; a satirical movie about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Some US officials said the Pyongyang government might be behind the hacks.Sony eventually issued the film, but only in limited release.The deaths of many other celebrities &#8212; from Beyonce to Michael Jordan to Jackie Chan and Sylvester Stallone &#8212; have been erroneously reported over the years, often in hacked internet postings.-AFP
