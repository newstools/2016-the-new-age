It can take a fair amount of time for a coach to get the morale of a club s players to the ideal level, and Fadlu Davids believes he has done that after just two matches. Davids was appointed as Maritzburg United caretaker coach a fortnight ago following the sudden resignation of Ernst Middendorp.The interim coach has overseen two matches and managed to collect four points out of a possible six. Under his guidance, the Team of Choice played to a 1-1 draw against Chippa United at home and followed that up with a precious 1-0 away win away to Baroka FC 1-0 on Sunday, courtesy of a goal by Sheldon van Wyk.That is a positive result for a team that struggled to find its way under Middendorp. Davids said there was an urgent need to boost the morale of the players to ensure that the team would get the desired results as they had only won two matches since the beginning of the season. The morale of the players is up now and we had two days off after the Baroka victory before preparing for the next game against Orlando Pirates at home, Davids said. In every game we have played, especially away from home this season, we have shown that we can compete against any team. In Bloemfontein, we came back with a point and against Ajax Cape Town we played well. Against Kaizer Chiefs and Sundowns we played well again though we lost. Our problem in the previous six or seven games was scoring, having opportunities to win the game in the last minutes but failing to take them. After 12 rounds of matches in the league, Maritzburg are ninth on the Absa Premiership table with 14 points. The club are in the market for Middendorp s replacement but if Davids continues to bring in the points the senior management of the club might well be tempted to give him a chance for the rest of the season.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
