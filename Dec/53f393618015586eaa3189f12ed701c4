Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) on Monday indicated that it&#8217;s Head Robert McBride will not be giving warning statement to the Hawks.McBride was expected to present himself for a warning statement at the Hawks offices in Pretoria at 11am.IPID spokesperson Moses Dlamini said the Hawks had requested McBride to provide the statement as part of its investigation into charges of defeating the ends of justice while he was chief of Ekhurhuleni Metro Police Department.In a statement issued later today police watchdog said: a few weeks ago the Hawks approached Colonel Mannie Fourie to dig up any dirt against Mr McBride.In a recorded telephonic conversation Colonel Fourie stated that the instruction came from the minister of police which the minister denied in Parliament Ipid said in a statement.The watchdog further added that the request by the Hawks to its head to give a warning statement today was a beginning of a campaign, as the charges were 10 years old and that it was dealt with at the time.The statement further reads that the Hawks were not acting in the interest of justice. The manner in which this matter is being pursued by the Hawks is similar to the way in which they pursued spurious and frivolous charges against the Minister of Finance which the NPA had to withdraw abruptly.We believe that this latest action by the Hawks is related to the Ipid having taken a warning statement from (Hawks head) General (Berning) Ntlemeza last week during which he threatened that the Hawks would be taking statements against Ipid investigators, IPID reiterated.Last week Gauteng Boss Major-General Prince Mokotedi&#8217;s laid criminal charges against McBride,Paul O&#8217;Sullivan former Gauteng Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya that included,Treason espionage and conspiracy to commit murder.However, head of Watchdog had last week Tuesday dismissed Mokote&#8217;s allegations, even going as a far as sending as warning to Gauteng head that be careful that if you play with a cat that the cat is not playing with you .He further alleged that the charges were concocted, saying he was being targeted. This will collapse like the rendition matter collapsed&#8230;we are unafraid we are not intimidated he said.Mokotedi claims the four accused met on December 3 at the former house of Czech gangster Radovan Krejcir now allegedly owned by O Sullivan.-TNA Reporter
