 Breastfeeding is not sexual it s natural, this was the strong message shared by South African born Victoria s Secret model Candice Swanepoel, 28, on Instagram on Monday.The new mum was responding to negative comments of a picture of herself breastfeeding her three-month-old son, Anaca.One user, @manueblingbling, in particular, said the model should not make breastfeeding a public exercise. I don t watch your boobs in general and I don t want to go out and be obliged to watch women with their breast out because it s natural or it s a baby, the user said.Candice responded to critics saying: Many women today are shamed for breastfeeding in public, or even kicked out of public places. I have been made to feel the need to cover up and shy to feed my baby in public places but strangely feel nothing for the topless editorials I ve done in the name of art?
