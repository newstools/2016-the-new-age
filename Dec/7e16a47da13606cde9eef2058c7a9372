&nbsp;Fashion designer Jeremy Scott and supermodel Stella Maxwell caused a stir when they rocked up together to the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards decked out in daring and vibrant outfits by Moschino.So it is only natural that the Italian fashion house would want to immortalize the moment by teaming up with toy giant Mattel to create a collector&#8217;s edition Barbie and Ken version of the pair.&#8216;Moschino Barbie &amp; Ken&#8217; sees Barbie modeling a scaled-down version of the label&#8217;s black velvet and graffiti wrap Fall 2015 gown that Maxwell wore on the red carpet. Scott, transformed into Ken down to the last detail, including his blonde buzz-cut hairstyle, sports a toy version of the custom-made multicolored striped tuxedo and trousers he wore to the event, which he originally designed as a reference to TV test signal stripes.US designer Scott, who juggles running his own namesake label alongside his role as creative director of Moschino, is famous for channeling his love of pop culture and cartoon graphics into his pieces.He has already teamed up with Mattel twice, creating an African American and a Caucasian Moschino Barbie in 2015.The latest Moschino Barbie and Ken doll gift set is now available at www.moschino.com and at the brand&#8217;s boutiques in Milan, Rome, London, Paris, New York and Los Angeles for $200.Beach towels adorned with the image of each figure are available for $135 each.-Relaxnews
