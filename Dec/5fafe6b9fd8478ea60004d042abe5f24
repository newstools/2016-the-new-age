MAMELODI Sundowns supremo Patrice Motsepe has allayed fears that coach Pitso Mosimane is on his way out of the club. Despite leading Sundowns to the CAF Africa Champions League triumph, Mosimane is yet to sign a new contract and there is already interest from top teams in Egypt for his services. Speaking on the sidelines of the Jacob G Zuma Foundation Soccer Tournament in Eshowe at the weekend, Motsepe took some time to clarify Mosimane s future. Pitso s contract is perfect and in fact our technical team s contracts are fine. We at Sundowns have ensured that we pay our people as much as we can. It is important to be competitive because if we don t take care of our coaches and players, they will leave, Motsepe said.On interest shown by Egyptian teams in Mosimane, the Sundowns owner said: I would be happy if Pitso gets an offer in Europe in the English Premier League or La Liga because we at Sundowns have an obligation to develop our people. He shouldn t go to Al Ahly or Zamalek because we beat those guys. In life you should set yourself goals and reach for the sky. Motsepe also disclosed that top players from the clubs Sundowns encountered en route to clinching the CAF title want to join the reigning African champions. It will be good for our football image if these top players come to our league. The technical team will decide if these players should come or not. He said they had learnt lessons from the recent Fifa Club World Cup where they fell at the first hurdle. It was good to be exposed to that kind of environment. We will get there but it won t happen overnight. We are looking forward to competing against some of the top teams in the world again in the near future. We still have a long way to meet that standard. Our local football will be better if we participate in such tournaments. news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
