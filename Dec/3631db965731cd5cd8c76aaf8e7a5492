Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi will on Friday brief the media on the outcomes and recommendations into allegations of racial discrimination at Pretoria High School for Girls.The briefing was initially scheduled to take place on Wednesday but was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances.This briefing comes after the department visited the school following allegations that learners were being discouraged from having hairstyles such as afros, bantu knots, dreadlocks and braids.The learners were allegedly told by the school to straighten their hair to avoid making their uniform untidy .Black pupils at the Pretoria High School for Girls spoke out about isolation and rules regarding African hair styles specifically afros, leading Lesufi to intervene.Lesufi had meetings with School Management Team (SMT), concerned group of learners, parents and with the School Governing Body (SGB).Some of the issues raised included, use of African languages on the school premises is not tolerated yet the other learners are allowed to express themselves in Afrikaans, the harassment and victimisation is not only limited to the school grounds, but at school excursions as well. Learners feel that they are not allowed to wear Black hairstyles, such as Afro. Specifically, the school policy limits the length of the hairstyle, and this is arbitrarily interpreted by the educators.The learners feel that educators use abusive and demeaning language when they address them regarding their hairstyles. For instance some educators tell them they look like monkeys, or have nests on their heads.&#8221;
