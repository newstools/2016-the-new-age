The judgment handed down by the Constitutional Court on November 25 in the matter of Masstores vs Pick Pay has validated Cosatu s assertion that monopolies and cartels are stifling economic growth and impeding job creation in South Africa.In this matter, Hyprop, the owner of the Capegate shopping centre and landlord, had entered into lease agreements with Pick Pay and Shoprite and granted these retailers exclusive rights to trade in food items as supermarkets. However, Masstores, trading as Game, undertook not to trade as a general food supermarket in the shopping centre, unless there was no general food supermarket trading there.Later Game started operating as a general supermarket contrary to its contract with the landlord. Pick Pay went to court and sought to stop Game from operating its supermarket on the basis that this interfered with its exclusive contractual right to trade as a supermarket in the shopping complex.In essence, Pick n Pay sought to protect its exclusive right to trade in terms of its lease agreement with landlord.The court found the exclusive right to trade was in conflict with the objective of free competition and prohibition against unlimited monopolies and that competition cannot be unlawful. Further, that these exclusive trading rights make the competitive field uneven.This is a welcome judgment that hopefully represents a small step in breaking up the domination of the SA economy by a few retailers. These big retailers have used their contractual powers in the form of exclusive trading rights to push out small businesses resulting in job losses.However, the judgment will not be a solution to the increasing concentration of market power of the big retailers such as Spar, Game, Makro, Checkers, Pick Pay.These so called anchor tenants in shopping malls have been given a free pass to suppress competition for a long time.This is pure alliance capitalism that is punishing both workers and consumers. Cosatu is anxiously awaiting the outcome of the grocery retail sector market inquiry by the Competition Commission. One of the outcomes of the inquiry should be to restrict further expansion of big retailers by legislatively requiring accommodation of small retailers in shopping malls.One of the objectives of the inquiry will be to examine the effects (both negative and positive) of the long term exclusive lease agreements entered into between property developers and supermarket chains and the role of financiers in these agreements on competition in the grocery retail sector.The practice of pushing out small business in big shopping malls in favour of large retailers should be disallowed by laws. Otherwise this practice will destroy jobs and entrench concentration in the retail market.StatisticsSA data shows that South Africa s jobless rate rose to a record of 27.1% in the third quarter and should prove as a call to action for government to do something about this alliance capitalism strangling our economy.Cosatu continues to argued that in order to address unemployment, we need to address the legacy of concentration and domination of the economy by a few monopolies. There is little space for SA small firms to create jobs for the 9 million unemployed workers because the economy is dominated by cartels.This is in addition to high administered prices such electricity, transport costs, non- availability of cheap finance and contractionary macroeconomic policies, which stifle the impact of industrial policy.The fact that South Africa has the highest jobless rate of more than 60 emerging and developed countries, according to Bloomberg and that South Africa has the highest unemployment rate since 2003. should trigger alarm bells and great concern.Sizwe PamlaSizwe Pamla is national spokesperson of Congress of South African Trade Unions
