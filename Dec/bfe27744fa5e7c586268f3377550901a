Chrome is being illegally mined in the Limpopo village of Ga-Maroga.The operation only requires a crowbar, shovel, pick and wheelbarrow to mine the resource.Locally referred to as wheelbarrow mining or pavement mining , the chrome rush has seen an increase of people in the village and neighbouring communities like Driekop, Riba Cross, Mandagshoek, Mashishi, Ga-Kgoete and Burgersfort. People are not hiding themselves. This is happening during the day and some are even doing it in their own backyards. People have been sitting on and building houses on chrome deposits which they were not aware of, a local resident said.He said mining is taking place on the main road to the village and the road s foundation has chrome deposits. The locals fear that such destruction will lead to service delivery protests. The Chinese are dominant buyers of 34 ton horse and trailers but lately there are buyers from the community, he said.He said the going rate for a bucket scoop of a smaller front-end loader fetches R1 500 in the low-scale mining operation.Although these types of illegal operations attract violent crimes, for now the only concern is mining of the main road. I suspect that very soon they will be going to the nearby old mines, he said.One such mine is the Dilokong Chrome mine which has been closed. Illegal mining by zama zamas, as they are commonly known, has been a problem for the country for the past few years.Last year the South African Human Rights Commission found that up to 30 000 people have been involved in the practice for the last 10 years. In Gauteng at least 400 incidents of illegal mining violence were reported between 2013 and 2015, highlighting the dangerous manner in which the criminal activity operates.At its nucleus, illegal mining involves zamazamas manually extracting metals from old, disused, unsafe and abandoned mines as well as operational and semi-operational mines and finally tailing dams and dumps.Efforts made by The New Age to reach the Department of Mineral Resources proved fruitless.In a statement from the department, it highlighted that the illegal mining modus operandi is continuously changing as the department and relevant stakeholders implement measures to eradicate the illicit activities.This was as a result of trapped zamazama miners in an old mine in Gauteng.An increase in violent crime, including murder, has been the result of rival gang activity fighting for diminishing opportunities.These include attacks on the police, the Department of Mineral Resources, the Council of Geoscience and mine officials.Mining and surface infrastructure has been compromised as a result of mining of remnants and stability pillars.The degradation of the environment including water, soil and air pollution is the result of processing in water streams using mercury.news@thenewage.co.za
