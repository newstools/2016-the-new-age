The immovable traditions and highly regarded legacy left by Lebowakgomo Wild Beasts deceased players and office bearers will be reignited on December 26 during the eighth edition of the Heroes Softball Tournament at Lebowakgomo High School.The event starts at 8.30am and the final is scheduled for 3pm.The tournament is an annual showpiece in remembrance of the Wild Beasts idols who put the club on the map before their deaths.This year s event will also mark the 37th anniversary since the club s establishment in 1979.Since its inception of this competition the team has used the tournament to honour late chairperson Polelo Masola, secretary Tlankie Muroa, pitcher Brightly Sebopa and shortstop Koketso Matlala.Masola and Muroa were highly instrumental in revolutionising the Limpopo Softball Association.Under their astute leadership, both the club and the association were stable and enjoyed media support and financial backing.Matlala and Sebopa also steered Wild Beasts to memorable victories.The duo were indispensable to both the defensive and offensive line-ups.Sebopa was lured from Kalkspruit Red Scorpions as a well-groomed player who was renowned for his perplexing deliveries from the pitcher s mound.Matlala, the younger brother of veteran outfielder Raymond Biya Matlala, was a tactical shortstop genius who performed a whole gamut of tricks from brilliant diving catches to double-play acts.The tournament on Family Day will feature the home side, Wild Beasts, along with provincial teams Mamelodi Pitbulls, Atteridgeville Jets and two clubs from neighbouring Botswana.Meanwhile, star-studded Moletlane Texas, who are the defending champions, are expected to embark on a short trip to the neighbouring township where they will have to prove that winning the tournament last year was no fluke.With the nonexistence of flagship events like the once-celebrated Hansa Classic Tournament, incumbent Wild Beasts chairperson Nkatse Mahlase says the Heroes Tournament is one of the most illustrious club tournaments on the Limpopo softball calendar. Wild Beasts Softball Club turns 37 this year and to celebrate this milestone we have planned a mega event that will pull large crowds in honour of our fallen heroes. We are calling all softball followers to come out in droves and enjoy this outdoor event, Mahlase said.The tournament will be played in a round-robin format on two diamonds. Each game will be played over seven innings or one-and-a-half hours, whichever comes first.MOYAHABO MABEBAprovinces@thenewage.co.za
