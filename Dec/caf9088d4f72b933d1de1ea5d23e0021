Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba says despite facing many social ills he hopes the newly opened clinic in Westbury will become a beacon of hope to the community that anything is possible.Mashaba made the plea on Tuesday as he officially opened the R33.4million health care facility which he said he hopes will be a a multi-functional centre where health workshops and local drug action community meetings can be hosted. The health and wellness of a community are key indicators of whether we are succeeding in building a sustainable city and a caring local government that responds to the needs of its people, said Mashaba.The state of the art clinic is set to provide healthcare to approximately 550 000 residents from the Auckland Park, Westdene, Brixton, Richmond, Crosby and Cottesloe surrounding communities.Today we officially opened the new Westbury Clinic #JhbBetterServices pic.twitter.com/xJQ87SZVW2 Herman Mashaba (@HermanMashaba) December 6, 2016Mashaba urged the community of Westbury to take ownership of the facility and protect it from drug dealers and gangs which operate in the area.&#8221; I am tired of drug dealers destroying our communities and stealing our youth s innocence. Drug lords and the criminal gangs terrorise the streets of Westbury. While we must be unforgiving with the drug lords, we need a caring approach towards drug addicts &#8221; said Mashaba.&#8221; We need to ensure that they receive quality treatment and are reintroduced into their communities. As the new administration we also recognise the direct links between drug abuse, gang-related activities and chronic diseases and poverty &#8221; Mashaba continued.The new clinic boasts an isolation room, a medical store, a facility for emergency services, a chill room for youth, a reception and waiting area as well as 18 consultation rooms.&#8221; I am exceptionally proud to hand over this modern facility to residents of Johannesburg in time for the start of the festive season &#8221; said Mashaba.#WestburyClinicOpening ^GZ pic.twitter.com/OexF3J7oVf City of Joburg (@CityofJoburgZA) December 6, 2016The opening of the Westbury Clinic comes after Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu officially launched the 24-hour emergency unit in Stretford Clinic on Monday.Mahlangu stated that with the 24-hour clinic will help improve the lives of pregnant women.
