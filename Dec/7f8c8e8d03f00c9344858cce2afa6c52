MANY lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) South Africans have been victims of hate crimes and discrimination while more than half live in fear of victimisation due to their sexual orientation or gender identity.A report, Hate Crimes against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) People in South Africa 2016, by the Love Not Hate Campaign found that 55% feared discrimination while 44% had experienced discrimination in their everyday life in the past two years. A total of 2 130 South Africans participated in the online study, which is believed to be the first-ever national research on LGBT discrimination and hate crimes. Among the most troubling findings are that discrimination levels in schools are extremely high, 56% of people aged 24 years or younger said they had experienced discrimination based on their LGBT status in school, campaign manager Lerato Phalakatshela said.He said 88% had not reported these incidents to the police due to concerns that they would not be taken seriously and that the police themselves may also be homophobic or abusers. When it comes to responses, the criminal justice system is slow to react and justice is not seen to be done. That explains the low reporting rates. People don t trust the system. A startling 41% of respondents knew of someone who had been murdered due to their sexual orientation or gender identity while 7% said they had been punched, hit, kicked or beaten. Another 7% experienced violence from a family member and 6% had been raped or sexually abused. We can identify from the findings that people do not report these attacks and as civil society organisations, we can only do so much to encourage people to report but we cannot guarantee them justice, Dawie Nel, director of OUT LGBT Well-being, said.Gauteng has seen a number of hate crimes including the murder of a young lesbian, Motshidisi Pascalina, 18, whose body was discovered in an open field in December 2015 near her home, three days after she went missing in Evaton North.In the same month, Phoebe Titus was stabbed to death by a 15-year-old boy in broad daylight because of her gender identity. In April, Tshifhiwa Ramurunzi was attacked and nearly killed by a homophobic assailant.-KUTULLO MADISHA
