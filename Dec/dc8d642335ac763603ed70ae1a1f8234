Proteas Stephen Cook says that batting with team mate Dean Elgar&#8217;s for a period of time is &#8216;very nice&#8217;.Cook&#8217;s comments come after the team&#8217;s first Sunfoil Test match against Sri Lanka at St George s Park in Port Elizabeth. In our previous outings we have sort of dovetailed, one of us has scored runs and the other hasn t. It s nice in this Test match to get a partnership going upfront, which helps the team a lot.&#8221; Cook saidHe said that opening the battle throughout his career has always been about forging partnerships and the only way to do that is by spending time out on the field. &#8221; I m sure this will hold us in good stead and give us some good memories to look back on when we play in tough times and need to do it again, Cook said.The player praised the batsmen&#8217;s rotation of strikes in a fast scoring innings which saw the team move at over four runs per over, this has given the team the ascendancy with two days left in the match.Cook observed that in the first innings Sri Lanka employed the deep-point and deep-square leg tactic quite a lot and cut off the boundaries. Dean and I, and when Hashim came in, looked to exploit the singles with the left-right hand combination to make sure they couldn t settle on their lengths. he said We haven t spoken about that as a team, he said of the timing of the declaration. The fact that we scored at 4.4 today sets us up to allow us to declare when we want to and the time is right. I m sure overnight the guys will start having some discussions as to when that will be. We are still going to have to play well and bowl them out again. the proteas batsman explained&#8211;TNA Reporter&nbsp;
