Several towns including farming areas in the Southern Cape are experiencing electricity cuts caused by veld fires that have erupted in the Blanco area in George.Although George firefighters and the Eden Fire Service were working hard to extinguish the blaze, Eskom reported that the smoke still affected the electricity supply.Mosselbay and Great Brak were highly affected and experienced a continuous black out due to the electricity tripping.This week, helicopters were dispatched to several areas to help fight the inferno, which was spread by strong winds and causing extensive damage to Eskom power lines.While fire personnel attempted to extinguish the blaze in Mosselbay, another blaze erupted in Plantation Road, close to Van Riebeeck Gardens.Another blaze started at the George dumping site next to the N2 between Thembalethu and Pacaltsdorp.Motorists travelling on the N2 were delayed due to heavy smoke that engulfed the national road.George fire brigade spokesperson Johan Crouse appealed to members of the public to be cautious and not start fires during the festive season. People should not burn grass or rubbish as the hot, windy conditions and the dryness of the grass makes firefighting difficult, Crouse said. The wind is very strong and the direction of the wind is mainly along the Eskom lines. In Oudtshoorn, residents were threatened by strong fires that started in an open field nearby.Firefighters battled for two hours to extinguish the flames that burnt some electric poles and fences.Oudsthoorn municipality spokesperson Ntobeko Mngqwengqwe said the town and surrounding areas were experiencing electricity cuts. The area is experiencing electricity trips. Eskom said it is due to veld fires that erupted in the Blanco area in George, Mngqwengqwe said.Louise Fouche, who lives close to the open field where the fire broke out said: These veld fires are scaring us. I moved some of the furniture because the blaze was strong and it quickly spread because of the strong winds. MPUMI KIVA
