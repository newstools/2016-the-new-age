The last of the big three ratings agencies, Standard &amp; Poor s, is today due to make its long-awaited call on South Africa s sovereign rating.Last week S&amp;P s downgraded Eskom s debt further into the sub-investment zone. So it s going to be tricky, especially as the agency has South Africa just one notch above junk, as does Moody s, while Fitch is still two grades away from junk.Moody s has changed its outlook on SA from stable to negative. Although S&amp;P has said that it did not seem that South Africa could fall into a recession anytime soon, there were no guarantees that it would follow the same route as the other two agencies.However, the agency has warned in the past couple of months that domestic economic reforms had to be implemented as a matter of urgency to avoid a downgrade.What is more worrying is that both in March and June, S&amp;P affirmed the country s investment grade rating one notch above junk status with a negative outlook, different to both Moody s and Fitch which were on a stable outlook before their decision last week.The agency lowered SA s GDP growth estimate to 0.6% from 1.6%, and analysts warned that for the fact that SA was on a negative outlook on S&amp;P ratings, any negative move would automatically send the country into junk status.Many observers take a dim view of the political tensions in the country, especially within the ANC and between various organs of state.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan surprised observers when he told Parliament, in answer to a parliamentary question, that he could not vouch for the accuracy of SARS s responses.Gardner Rusike, S&amp;P analyst for Africa, said major key issues facing South Africa were about turning around the economic growth and addressing itself to the existing political tensions which have been intensifying.Colen Garrow, economist at Lefika Securities, said S&amp;P would once again review economic and political risk factors which contributed to the current rating.Some quarters believe that S&amp;P will review the country s situation based on the progress made in the last six months, especially progress regarding growth-enhancing policy reform and fiscal consolidation.Stanley Pule, an independent economist, said although both Moody s and Fitch were somehow impressed by the national Treasury s intention and commitment to improving the country s fiscal position, the reality was that enough had not been done yet and that political reforms were required to lift the country s growth and avoid a ratings downgrade. What is likely to happen today is difficult to predict and at the same time frightening, given S&amp;P s move towards Eskom last week.The fact that SA has been put on a negative watch by S&amp;P in the last six months poses a threat somehow, he said.Bernard Sathekge|bernards@thenewage.co.za
