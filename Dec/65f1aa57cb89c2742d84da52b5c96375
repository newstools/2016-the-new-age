The public will be allowed to sit in on former SABC chief operations officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng s disciplinary hearing, as ordered by the Western Cape High Court yesterday. The new disciplinary proceedings shall be open to the public and the media shall be entitled to record and report on the proceedings, judge Andre Le Grange said yesterday.Le Grange found that the decision by the SABC to appoint Motsoaneng to another position after his appointment as COO was declared unlawful by another court, had been irrational.He said unless the findings by the public protector were reviewed and set aside or Motsoeneng was cleared by the new disciplinary hearing, he cannot work at the SABC.The new disciplinary hearing comes after yesterday s declaration by the court that the SABC disciplinary ruling of October 12, 2015 which cleared Motsoeneng of any wrongdoing, although he had been found to have committed fraud by the public protector, was inconsistent with the Constitution and invalid.The case was brought to court by the opposition DA party.Motsoeneng s supporters protested outside court as the judgment was being delivered.President of the Musician s Association of South Africa (Masa) Tebogo Sithathu said the court ruling was not surprising as it had long been decided that Motsoeneng was a guilty man. Are you surprised? We as Masa are not at all surprised as the decision to find fault with Motsoeneng has long been decided. I have no faith in the South African judiciary system which has been captured by racists clearly serving the racist masters. The whole debate about Hlaudi s suitability to lead the SABC has been hijacked by ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and many others who influence how South Africans see the SABC, Sithathu said. The SABC is directed to commence disciplinary proceedings against Motsoeneng for dishonesty relating to the misrepresentation of his qualifications, abuse of power and improper conduct in the appointments and salary increments of Sully Motsweni and for his role in the purging of senior staff members, the judge said.Dudu Dube and Siyabonga Sitholedudud@thenewage.co.za
