BAFANA Bafana midfielder Mandla Masango could be in hot water with his Danish club Randers for training with SuperSport United without their permission. The former Kaizer Chiefs star has long yearned for a move away from Randers since the club rejected a transfer offer from fellow Danish side Aalborg.After publicly airing his frustration, Masango was sent to train with the youth team, something that exacerbated matters between the player and the club. After returning to South Africa following the conclusion of the Danish season, Masango has decided to train with SuperSport to keep himself fit.Sources have said the 27 year old is keen to play for the Tshwane side and their coach, Stuart Baxter, is a big fan of the player he coached at Chiefs two seasons ago. But Randers are unimpressed with Masango s decision to train with SuperSport without their consent, saying it is unacceptable and a violation of his contract. His contract will expire in 2018.Randers sporting manager Ole Nielsen said the club is unhappy with the latest developments. We have written to both Mandla and the club to tell them that it is unacceptable that he trains with another club and that it is in complete violation of his contractual relationship. We have not received an answer, but we can see that he has received the message, he said. We know very well that many in the football world have friends crisscrossing club borders and therefore we also do not mind players visiting a good friend in another club. In some cases, it may also make sense to train with another club to keep going and I have also before given players permission to do that, but it requires that you ask first. If Masango ends up at SuperSport, he will become the third former Chiefs player to follow Baxter to the club. Goalkeeper Reyaard Pieterse and defender Tefu Mashamaite have reunited with Baxter. Mashamaite spent a season in Denmark with BK Hacken.news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
