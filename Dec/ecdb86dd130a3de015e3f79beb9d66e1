The Canadian singer is set to make a comeback in 2017 with a new album called &#8220;The Ride.&#8221; The video accompanying the &#8220;Man eater&#8221; singer&#8217;s single, &#8220;Pipe Dreams,&#8221; taken from the upcoming album, has now been released on the YouTube channel of American magazine, Pitchfork. Here&#8217;s a look back over the artist&#8217;s career in five music videos.&#8220;I&#8217;m Like a Bird&#8221;In the year 2000, the young Nelly Furtado burst onto the pop scene with the single, &#8220;I&#8217;m Like A Bird,&#8221; which was a hit worldwide. The album &#8220;Whoa, Nelly!&#8221; sold several million copies thanks to hits like &#8220;Turn Off the Light&#8221; and &#8220;&#8230; On the Radio (Remember the Days),&#8221; offering a mainstream pop sound straddling several musical genres. In 2001, Nelly Furtado won the Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &#8220;I&#8217;m Like a Bird.&#8221;Watch the video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roPQ_M3yJTA&#038;feature=youtu.be&nbsp;&#8220;For a&#8221;Riding high on her initial success, Nelly Furtado wanted her second album, &#8220;Folklore,&#8221; to reflect and celebrate her Portuguese origins. Despite &#8220;For a&#8221; being picked as the anthem of the 2004 European Football Championship, the album failed to meet with the same success as its predecessor.Watch the video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk1v9s5s7YI&#038;feature=youtu.be&#8220;Maneater&#8221;Nelly Furtado then teamed with heavyweight producer, Timbaland, to work on a new album called &#8220;Loose.&#8221; Released in 2006 and featuring hits like &#8220;Maneater,&#8221; &#8220;Promiscuous&#8221; and &#8220;Say It Right,&#8221; the singer&#8217;s third album stormed to the top of the charts.Watch the video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLolag3YSYU&#038;feature=youtu.be&#8220;Manos al Aire&#8221;After this huge international success, the singer recorded an album in Spanish, called &#8220;Mi Plan,&#8221; which bagged her another Grammy Award in 2010.Watch the video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5c3tfvp4Lc&#038;feature=youtu.be&#8220;Pipe Dreams&#8221;After a fifth album that went largely unnoticed (&#8220;The Spirit&#8221;), Nelly Furtado is set to return with a new album called &#8220;The Ride,&#8221; due out in March 2017. The singer has ditched her former R&#8217;n&#8217;B getup for a 1980s-inspired aesthetic, as seen in this minimalist video showing the singer walking through a house.Watch the video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dardmy1eNw&#038;feature=youtu.be-Relaxnews
