The government was yesterday mum on when an interim board would be appointed following the resignation of the last remaining SABC board member.The communications department refused to comment after board chairperson Prof Mbulaheni Maguvhe quit yesterday. We are not commenting on that matter and all enquiries should be directed to the presidency, Communications Department spokesperson Mish Molakeng said.The presidency confirmed it had accepted the resignation. A decision on an interim board will be taken. President Zuma thanks Maguvhe for his services at the SABC and wishes him all the best in his future endeavours, the presidency said.The resignation comes days after Maguvhe appeared before a parliamentary inquiry looking into the board s fitness to hold office.This was after his failed attempt to interdict the inquiry.During his appearance in Parliament last week, he failed to account for a number of things happening at the SABC, including the eight journalists who were axed for questioning the editorial policy changes at the broadcaster.Political analyst Sipho Seepe said he should have resigned much earlier. He said the failure of the SABC was reflective of the failure of the parliamentary committee to perform its oversight duties. The board accounted directly to the committee. Why did it take so long for them to see the issues? The problem started with a questionable interview process when the board was put in place, he said.Seepe however criticised the parliamentary inquiry, saying it had been biased from the onset. He said it was clear what the outcome would be.The portfolio committee on communications welcomed Maguvhe s resignation. The committee is concerned by the allegations Prof Maguvhe might have misled the ad hoc committee, it said.LILLIAN SELAPISA snn4@thenewage.co.za
