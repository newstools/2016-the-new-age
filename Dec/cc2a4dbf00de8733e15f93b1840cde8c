Africa needs armies that are better equipped and trained to counter the jihadist menace, Senegalese President Macky Sall said on Monday, appealing for foreign help.Opening a forum on peace and security in Africa, Sall said: &#8220;The truth is that in most of our countries, the armies are not up to the mark.&#8220;Today, we have to make internal efforts to raise their levels,&#8221; he said, calling for better equipment and training.&#8220;Africa needs the support of its partners,&#8221; he said, hailing the existing cooperation with the European Union for training troops.The Islamic State group has spread from its bases in Syria and Iraq to gain a significant foothold in Libya, and it has also carried out attacks in Algeria and Egypt.West Africa has also been rocked by violence from the Boko Haram jihadist group, which started a brutal insurgency in Nigeria&#8217;s mainly-Muslim north seven years ago. The violence has since spread to Cameroon, Chad and Niger.&#8220;The terrorists are not choir boys,&#8221; Sall said, adding that unrest in Mali had made the country &#8220;the bloodiest theatre in the history of (UN) peacekeeping missions&#8221;.Mali regained control of its northern cities from jihadists after a French-led international military intervention in January 2013, but insurgents remain active across large parts of the region. More than 70 blue helmets have so far been killed in action in the west African country.French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said peacekeeping forces &#8220;had to have a more robust doctrine to face new security situations&#8221;, including &#8220;training and equipment&#8221;.-AFP
