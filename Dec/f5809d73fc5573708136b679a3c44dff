The Gauteng premier s official residence was snapped up for R17m yesterday after an emotional roller-coaster for a bidder on the last day of the online auction.The luxurious house, situated in Bryanston north of Johannesburg and estimated to be worth R25m, went to the highest bidder who is reportedly linked to the EFF.The Gauteng provincial government s residential properties sold yesterday were 10 out of the 17 plus the premier s house, bringing the total to at least 11 properties.The other properties were sold to developers while the rest did not sell as banks do not finance vacant land.The winning bidder did not go to the auctioned residence and had the last laugh while his rival, who sources said was a well-known high court judge attended the bid.At one point the suspected judge bid R16250000, the system countdown went from five minutes without anyone challenging, those at the auction, which was held at the posh Bryanston house, started to count down, until a second was left, they applauded him and he expressed joy until the system showed that at the last second, a bidder was active online and the bidding had to continue.The losing bidder asked for his pictures not to be taken. I live a very private life, I would appreciate it if you don t publish any images of me, he said.A source close to the bidder said: the winning bidder has visited the house more than 15 times with his wife. He really wanted the house. Tirhani Mabunda, the director of Tirhani Auctioneers, the company handling the auction on behalf of theGauteng Department of Infrastructure Development (GDID) expressed satisfaction with the auction outcome. The auction went very well, the house sold for R17075000. The system was still loading, it was not closed yet and someone put in a bid and the bid was accepted so it went on, Mabunda said. The people who were bidding at this point cannot be revealed, he said.This was the first auction which formally started last week Monday and ended yesterday, where GDID had cleared 18 properties including the official residence of the premier. Other properties included 17 vacant stands in Heidelberg and Mogale City. The auctioneer will send a report to me, at an appropriate time I will make an announcement of the audit, GDID MEC Jacob Mamabolo said. The province is disposing of about 413 properties valued at billions of rands.Mamabolo assured the residents of Gauteng that the disposal process would be done in a transparent, accountable and fair manner.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
