The efforts by the Sol Plaatje municipality to bring dignity to the communities in the area is in full swing as was witnessed with the issuing of title deeds last week.Municipal representative Benjamin Plaatje said issuing of title deeds is fulfilling the promise made by mayor Mangaliso Matika during the month-long council Meet the People Programme aimed at engaging the communities.The municipality issued more than 270 title deeds in Lerato Park last week. We urge the community and home owners to occupy them before they get vandalised. We also ask our people not to sell these houses, Plaatje said. He said the municipality was also sorting some lists of about 100 people who had to get title deeds possibly early next year. We have today given 275 people ownership of their homes, this is part of our efforts to accelerate service delivery to the people of Kimberley and surrounding areas, Plaatje said.One of the home owners who received his title deeds was Johannes Bartlett, 66, who said he was glad that finally he would have a place he could call his own. I am happy to have finally received my title deed, I am living with my brother and daughter and we solely depend on a social grant, this will go a long way in ensuring our dignity is returned, Bartlett said.He said the house would offer them some sense of security, as there were lot of crooks in the area.Recently Matika said community members would get their title deeds and should get relevant documents.Matika also said the municipality would work with all the government departments both from national and provincial to fast-track services such as housing which seemed to be a great concern to the community. Ours as a local municipality is to ensure that our people get quality roads, water and electricity so that the lives of ordinary people will go well, he said.He further said all elected leaders needed to be accountable to their constituencies to make sure people on the ground were well-informed of government programmes and initiatives. All councillors need to call community meetings every month and hear concerns and challenges from the people. They should also give monthly reports to the speaker, he said.TIISETSO MANOKO AND NOMUSA MVUBU
