HIV-AIDS patients at Edenvale Hospital are allegedly being left with soiled nappies for days and sometimes even assaulted. Bertha Mokoena of Alexandra, whose 40-year-old daughter (name withheld) was admitted on November 22, said: My daughter developed bed sores and a nappy rash at the hospital. Mokoena said her younger sister made the discovery when she turned her daughter to change her position after noticing a bad smell. The nurses did not seem to care and accused my sister of undermining them because she gave my daughter a bath, she said. Mokoena said during her daughter s stay at the horror hospital, she was unable to do anything for herself. The morning staff would place a jug of water on top of the cupboard but she was too weak to pour water for herself, the only time she would drink water was when she was taking her treatment. That was pure negligence, Mokoena said. When the family tried to complain she was told the matron was not available. My sister left a note with her contact numbers but till today, the matron has not called, Mokoena said. Another Alexandra resident said the community called the hospital hamba ungabuyi which is loosely translated as the place of no return, unless by the grace of God . Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu s spokesperson, Steve Mabona, asked for details of the family so that the department could intervene. Unfortunately, we do not have more details to conduct an enquiry and facilitate a redress meeting with the affected family, Mabona said. He said it was the nurses responsibility to ensure that patients were washed every day, irrespective of what ailment they had.ntombin@thenewage.co.za-Ntombi Nkosi
