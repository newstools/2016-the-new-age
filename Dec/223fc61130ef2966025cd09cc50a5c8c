The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has warned people to respect animal rights when celebrating the New Year.SPCA spokesperson Insp Moloko Manaka said people who did not obey the Animal Protection Act by setting off firecrackers this festive season would be reported to the police.Manaka said although it was not incumbent upon the SPCA to enforce the law against those who frightened animals with firecrackers, they still reported such incidents to the relevant authorities.The law on firecrackers was enforced my municipalities through municipal by-laws.Manaka, however, was not entirely satisfied with the by-laws governing animal rights in the province.Speaking to TNA yesterday, she said: The situation at the moment is still manageable. The situation will be tense on New Year s Eve and throughout the day on New Year s Day. Dogs will try to run away from their homes and in the process, some might get injured. There will be others who will get lost as they will be frightened by the loud bang of firecrackers. Some residents are expected to drop off their pets at our institutions for safekeeping so that they can ignite their firecrackers without frightening the animals. Manaka said dogs feared the sound of crackers and this infringed on their rights as animals. Remember, the hearing of a dog is 10 times more than our hearing, so if a dog hears the sound of a cracker, it is like a bomb to the dog, she said. So that is why animals get frightened. Any animal gets frightened by the noise of crackers. Please be a responsible pet owner, be a responsible citizen, do not light fire crackers near animals. Manaka also said the SPCA was fully prepared for the increase in the intake of stray animals during the festive period, adding that people should report stray pets to the society if they saw any.MOYAHABO MABEBAprovinces@thenewage.co.za
