Manchester United midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan understands that competition for places kept him out of manager Jose Mourinho&#8217;s plans but is determined to show he deserves a first-team spot.The Armenian import from Borussia Dortmund started in the Community Shield season curtain-raiser against Leicester City but was dropped after a four-game Premier League run ended with a poor display in a 2-1 loss to Manchester City on Sept. 10.&#8220;I was thinking that I would be here as a starting lineup player but&#8230; I saw that there were 25 players fighting for their place and I understood that it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy,&#8221; Mkhitaryan told Sky Sports.&#8220;There was no bad relation with him (Mourinho). It was always good but the problem wasn&#8217;t him, it was me.&#8221;United&#8217;s new Portuguese boss gave Mkhitaryan a league start in the 1-1 draw at home to West Ham United on Nov. 27 after a two-month gap and three days later he impressed in a 4-1 League Cup quarter-final win against the same team with two assists.&#8220;Now I understand why I have got my chance and I will keep it&#8230; because it is very important for me to play, to be a part of Manchester United,&#8221; the 27-year-old midfielder added.&#8220;I had a bad game against Manchester City but that is in the past&#8230; I have done a great job to get my chance back&#8230;&#8221;&#8220;The manager has a lot of choice, he has five or six players in that position but I know that playing now, I know what I have done bad in the past and what good I can do in the future.&#8221;United, sixth in the Premier League, visit Zorya Luhansk in the Europa League group stage on Thursday needing at least a draw to guarantee a place in the last 32.They host the Premier League&#8217;s fifth-placed side Tottenham Hotspur, who they trail by six points, on Sunday.-Reuters
