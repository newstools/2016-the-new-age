Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Friday killings he maintains he committed while mayor of a southern city, sometimes cruising the streets on a motor bike looking for &#8220;encounters to kill&#8221;, were part of legitimate operations against drug pushers.Speaking to Filipino journalists traveling with him in Singapore, Duterte said he had killed three men during a hostage-taking incident in Davao City where he was mayor for more than 20 years.&#8220;It was not because I was walking around that I killed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was actually an event that was covered by the TV&#8230;I said I killed about three of them. I didn&#8217;t really know how many bullets from my gun went through inside their bodies.&#8221;The firebrand leader told a gathering of business leaders at the presidential palace on Monday he had &#8220;personally&#8221; killed criminals and that he was prowling the city&#8217;s streets on a big bike looking for &#8220;encounters to kill&#8221;.Senators have warned Duterte risks impeachment because of his statements about personally killing criminals in Davao.Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said in Washington Duterte&#8217;s statement about looking for chances to kill criminals while riding a bike were &#8220;deeply troubling&#8221;.&#8220;The United States continues to be concerned by the widespread reports of extrajudicial killings by, or at the behest of, government authorities in the Philippines,&#8221; he said.During the election campaign early this year, the 71-year-old former prosecutor referred to the hostage-taking incident in Davao City to demonstrate toughness in fighting drug dealers.&#8220;NOT GENOCIDE&#8221;Duterte said he was only after criminals and would not murder because of race, religion or political belief. &#8220;It&#8217;s not genocide, it&#8217;s about crime. It&#8217;s not covered under the charter of the International Criminal Court,&#8221; he said.&#8220;If you are fighting drug addicts and criminal, I can go as many as I want and for as long as there are drug pushers in the streets in my country&#8230; this campaign will go on until the last day of my term.&#8221;He said of anyone who would destroy the country, &#8220;I would not have second thought about cutting your head off&#8221;, ordering the police to go out and hunt the drug peddlers and kill those who resist.More than 2,000 people have died in anti-drug police operations since Duterte came to power on July 1, with another 3,000 killed by masked men on motor cycles or vigilantes.-Reuters
