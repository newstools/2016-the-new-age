British singer George Michael, who became one of the pop idols of the 1980s with Wham! and then forged a career as a successful solo artist with sometimes sexually provocative lyrics, died at his home in England on Sunday. He was 53.In the mid-1980s, Wham! was one of the most successful pop duos ever, ahead even of Simon &amp; Garfunkel, with singles like &#8221;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&#8221;, &#8221;Careless Whisper&#8221;, &#8220; Last Christmas&#8221; and &#8220; The Edge of Heaven&#8221;.&#8220;It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period,&#8221; his publicist said in a statement.&#8220;The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage,&#8221; the statement said.British police said Michael&#8217;s death was &#8220;unexplained but not suspicious.&#8221;Born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou June 25, 1963 in London to Greek Cypriot immigrant parents in a flat above a north London laundrette, Michael once played music on the London underground train system before finding fame with Wham!.With a school friend, Andrew Ridgeley, he formed Wham! in 1981, a partnership that would produce some of the most memorable pop songs and dance-floor favorites of the 1980s.&#8220;I am in deep shock,&#8221; said Elton John. &#8220;I have lost a beloved friend &#8211; the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist. My heart goes out to his family and all of his fans. @GeorgeMichael #RIP.&#8221;-Reuters
