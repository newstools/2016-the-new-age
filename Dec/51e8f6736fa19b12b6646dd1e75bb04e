The National Football League handed the New York Giants a $150,000 fine on Tuesday for illegal use of communications equipment during their 10-7 win over the Dallas Cowboys on December 11.In addition, Giants head coach Ben McAdoo was fined $50,000 while the team&#8217;s fourth-round draft pick will be moved to the back of the round.The infractions resulted from McAdoo&#8217;s use of a walkie-talkie in the fourth quarter of the regular season contest.The US media reported that McAdoo turned to the walkie-talkies for a handful of fourth-quarter plays after the team&#8217;s official communication equipment malfunctioned and there were problems sending in plays to quarterback Eli Manning.&#8220;League policy prohibits a coach from using such devices in a game,&#8221; an NFL spokesman said.AFP
