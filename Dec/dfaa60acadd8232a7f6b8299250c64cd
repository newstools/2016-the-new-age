The removal of President Jacob Zuma from office is not on the agenda for discussion in an urgent council meeting of a group of concerned former Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) veterans scheduled to sit later this week.Spokesperson for the group led by former cabinet minister Siphiwe Nyanda, Archie Mogodiri said the recent calls for Zuma to step down would not be discussed at the meeting. We are not going to talk about the recall of President Zuma. It s not on the agenda and it will not be open for discussion, Mogodiri said.He said, however, that the group of concerned MK veterans would discuss their desire to participate in the ANC s first two days of its policy conference with a group of ANC stalwarts and veterans who were signatories to the For the Sake of our Future document. We will be discussing how we can participate in the upcoming ANC national consultative conference. Mogodiri, making reference to the crisis trajectory that the ANC has found itself in, said the council meeting would undertake a fact finding mission to get to the crux of the ruling party s challenges. The challenge is the moral decay of the ANC today. People no longer see it as a liberation movement. There is also a loss of trust. We will come up with ways to advise the ANC on the way to go. Mogodiri said that the group of concerned MK veterans would seek an audience with the ANC on the resolutions of the meeting. The resolutions will be tabled with the ANC, he said.Bonolo Selebanobonolos@thenewage.co.za
