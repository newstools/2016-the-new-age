LeBron James&#8217;s 27 points in the Cleveland Cavaliers&#8217; 114-84 blowout of the Miami Heat on Friday moved the Cavs superstar into ninth place on the NBA&#8217;s all-time scoring list.James added eight rebounds and eight assists against his former team, and Kevin Love fought through back spasms to contribute 28 points and 15 rebounds.Kyrie Irving scored 23 points as Cleveland notched their third straight victory and their second in a row by 30 points.The Heat, hit by Dwyane Wade&#8217;s departure in free agency and a spate of injuries, are floundering.They languish in last place in their division, their playoff hopes already looking dim with three quarters of the season remaining.Miami&#8217;s Udonis Haslem was a late scratch for personal reasons, which meant there were no Heat players on the floor who played with James prior to his departure from Miami three seasons ago.Former Cavs guard Dion Waiters, nursing a torn thigh muscle, was among six Heat players sidelined by injury, and the available players just couldn&#8217;t keep pace in the second half.A driving layup by Irving at the third-quarter buzzer stretched Cleveland&#8217;s lead to 87-69 and coach Tyronn Lue pulled his starters after James passed Elvin Hayes (27,313) for ninth place on the scoring list.James came into the contest with 27,288 points and needed 26 to move up the list.
