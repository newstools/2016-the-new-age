The University of Cape Town (UCT) has announced its fee increment of 8% for 2017, which consider needs of students from lower-income families.&#8220;The institution made the announcement on Tuesday. The Council approved the implementation in 2017 of an 8% general increase in tuition fees and a 10% increase in accommodation fees for students who have a household income over R600 000,&#8221; said the university in a statement.Furthermore, stating the decision takes into account the inadequate government subsidy for higher education as well as the need for graduates who can contribute to the South African economy.&#8220;The Council confirmed that qualifying students from families with incomes less than R600 000 will not face any increase in tuition or accommodation costs in 2017,&#8221; said the institution.Council noted that for these students, since there was no increase in fees in 2016, this in effect amounts to a 4% increase per year for tuition and a 5% increase per year for accommodation and meals.The council will also continue with UCT s unique financial aid support for students in the missing middle. No student accepted on academic grounds will be prevented from studying at UCT for reasons of affordability if they fall into this income group.Students qualifying who are in private accommodation will receive an increase of 10% in their financial aid allowances to cover expected rental increases.Meanwhile, those in self-catering residences will receive an increase of 10% in food allowances to reflect the inflation in food prices.The institution is among many universities across the country that has decided to hike their fees which are capped at 8%.Fort Hare University in the Eastern Cape was the first institution to announce a zero percent fee increase for 2017, Tshwane University of Technology recently made the decision to not hike fees for all students.Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education and Training is expected to release its final report in June 2017.-TNA Reporter
