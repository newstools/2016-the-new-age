FOR a long time Polokwane City have been listed as one of the Absa Premiership s candidates for relegation but coach Luc Eymael no longer wants to hear that kind of talk. Eymael, who boasts an impressive record as a coach in Africa, has boldly said he is not in South Africa just to help Rise and Shine maintain their status in the top tier. I am not here to save the team from relegation, if it s like that I will leave Polokwane and go to another club. I have already received a lot of offers, some here and others abroad, he said. My target is to help City achieve a top-eight finish for the first time. I have said that since the beginning and it hasn t changed. Since his arrival on the continent in 2010, Eymael has coached respected clubs such as Democratic Republic of Congo s AS Vita and Sudan s Al Merrikh. I have coached in Africa and won four titles in six years and being asked if I came here to Polokwane to save the team, you think that s my target? I am a competitor, Eymael said. Last year, when I coached Al Merrikh of Sudan, we reached the semifinals of the CAF Champions League. I also did well coaching in countries such as Gabon, Congo and Kenya. The 57-year-old Belgian understands it will be tough to challenge for league honours with City but he is confident of a top-eight finish. If I don t succeed, it will mean I failed to achieve my own target and failed to accomplish what the chairperson brought me here for, he said.So far Eymael looks to be well on his way to carrying out his mandate as City are fifth on the PSL log with 21 points from 14 matches. City visit SuperSport United at Lucas Moripe Stadium tonight hoping to return to winning ways.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
