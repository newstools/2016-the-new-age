Many farmers and rural people in the Free State are bracing themselves for criminal attacks which tend to spike during the festive season.Despite efforts to strengthen rural safety, crime over the festive season shows an increase that sometimes seems to catch even the authorities by surprise.Although farm murders have subsided slightly, recent reports have caused alarm and it seems they are again on the increase.The Free State Agric (FSA), seeking a more in-depth understanding into the causes of the farm attacks has questioned whether farm attacks really are a consequence of poverty and joblessness.The same question has been raised by the farming community in the Free State as more and more farms fall victim of attacks. The FSA has even called for an investigation into the real causes and motives.According to the organisation, in 2015 alone 79 farms were attacked in the Free State, leaving 22 people dead, including 14 farm workers and their children.There were also 22 attempted murders and 52 armed robberies.According to a report released in January by the FSA, a banner organisation for farmers in the province, the Free State consists of 76 towns and their farming communities, of which 26 experienced attacks in 2013, 35 in 2014 and 50 in 2015.A total of 35 of the towns farming communities experienced two to five attacks in a year.The organisation said the perception exists in the media that poverty and joblessness can be motives behind farm attacks but safety coordinators in the Free State say these were motives for only 20.83% of incidents.The Institute for Security Studies has reported that killings of farmers in the country has reached alarming heights with the proportion far exceeding the country s average.Dr Johan Burger, a researcher at the institute, said on average the proportion of murder was 32.9 per 100 000 South Africans while the comparison to farmers was 128 per 100 000 farmers.These figures are alarmingly high, especially since farmers are not working in a dangerous and risky profession(in theory, anyway) such as in the police force, where the average murder proportion is only about 57 for every 100000.Speaking to The New Age, Burger said the challenge with rural safety was that police had to spread their resources to everyone, who are often far apart to begin with. Police have the challenge to keep everyone in the country safe and over the years we have seen an increase in many areas that police need to focus on, he said.Burger said over the past 18 years the rate of murder and attempted murder had gone down by about 55%.He said, however, that there has been an upsurge in the murder rate over the past three years.Police have also made a commitment that they will back the farming community and intensify strategies to keep them safe.Acting police commissioner Lt-Gen Khomotso Phahlane has made and undertaking to collaborate with stakeholders such as organised agricultural unions in fighting incidents of violence on farms and small holdings.This, he said, should be an emerging priority in the current 2016-17 financial year.Safety tips for farmers: Maintain constant contact with neighbours, the police and the community Become part of a farm watch initiative that regularly patrols the area Form part of and engage in communication structures (like WhatsApp groups) to keep themselves informed about suspect vehicles/persons Good relationships with farm workers are essential and must be improved to where workers also provide information about possible suspect vehicles and persons Keep small dogs in the house, especially at night Ensure only one access route to farm houses Bedrooms should be separated from the rest of the house with security gates Victims should try to remain calm during an attack so that they can think practically/realistically Regularly practice your personal safety plan in your house with your family (like indicating who is responsible for what during an attack).KAMOGELO SEEKOEIkamogelos@thenewage.co.za
