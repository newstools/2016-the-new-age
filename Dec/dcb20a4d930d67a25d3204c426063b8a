Under normal economic conditions of any country, set economic goals entailed in growth and development plans that cannot be realistically achieved either in the medium or long-term basis are not worth pursuing. In some circumstances, it is easy for us as human beings to believe in the big myth than the small truth.The factual economic situation of South Africa is that the structure of our economy in terms of ownership, management, control and active participation remains unfairly skewed in favour of a few people and tilted against the poor majority of citizens.The structure of the economy has always been exclusive for more than a century. Thus 50% is marginalised in the periphery of the mainstream economic sectors of the country s economy.The structure of our exclusive economy can hardly produce inclusive economic growth to the benefit of all citizens. The economic residuals that arise from this exclusive structure of the economy further pushes this category of the poor citizens to the deep end of poverty and hardship.This scenario was not definitely divinely ruled; rather it is the undesirable outcome of deliberate economic policy design by some human beings to create and produce long-term inequities of various forms that may not be easily credited through exclusive and inequitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth to the few owners and controllers of the means of economic production.At times what is often stated by those who believe they can change the structure of the economy of our country is not the same as what gets done in the economic sectors by those who control, manage and the economic means of production.But, because as human beings we have grown accustomed to the tradition of wanting to easily believe what we hear and not what we see, we seem to sheepishly accept that the exclusive nature and structure of the economy will yield inclusive economic growth for the poor 40% unemployed South Africans.This 40% has been living in dire poverty as a result of the historical inequitable distribution of the means of economic production.The minister of finance said this 40% of poor citizens do not benefit from the economy. Even the reduction of poverty over the past 10 years is not as a direct result of the positive exclusive economic growth s progressive economic activities; it is attributed to increasing social security, social protection and social insurance made available by the government to the poor indigent citizens who are viewed as vulnerable groups.This condition stretches the social expenditure to be among the highest in the world to deal directly with highest proportion of unemployment, poverty and inequality.The dreams of a better life for all may not be realised even in the long term as long as the nature and structure of our economy remain untransformed and exclusive of the 40% of the poor South African citizens, even if the economy was to grow at 5%.The question is what should be done and how to do it? Which political and economic policy instruments, to be used with responsive results to solve the political economy problem of national resources ownership, management and control?Should we reengineer the structure of the country s economy as a first priority while maintaining acceptable levels of economic growth in the context of a globalising economy?As exclusive and modernised, the untransformed economy of South Africa transits from one stage to another as it adjust to global forces and due to technological advances. This form of economic transition tends to perpetuate de-skilling, economic residuals, income and social inequalities, as well as unemployment.The macro-economic policies are neither based on general nor at least a sufficient consensus-driven superstructure meta-policy framework, consciously designed to deliberately level the playing field with the view to effect economic equity across all racial groups in the country.This could instil a strong collective sense of national economic ownership legitimacy among all racial groups.Therefore the broader economic development goal should be to refocus on economic re-engineering of the underlying fundamental structure of the South Africa s economy to become all inclusive, participatory, representative and equitable in terms of ownership, management and control so that it could yield shared economic growth among all South Africans of all stripes and hues.If managed proficiently, the inevitable imperative to transform the structure of the economy is not mutually exclusive with the need and urge of stimulating inclusive growth.Both of these strategic economic goals could be pursued successfully without causing harm to anyone.This also could be done without compromising the credible efforts of the government to stimulate economic growth through job creation, capital formation and other responsive economic policy instruments to address exclusive structure of economy only as having locomotive function in this way, perhaps the more often talked-about radical economic transformation could be realised in our lifetime.Fundamental structural economic re-engineering cannot be executed successfully to achieve effective economic emancipation of the poor excluded black citizens by merely paying lip service, using the normal blunt economic policy instruments that have proven to be failures in transforming the economy.Extraordinary policy measures and decisive and unpopular economic policy choices need to be made by the political and economic leadership with courage and corresponding mutual commitment to action those economic policy decisions to normalise the structure of economy for it to be amenable to yield equitably shared economic rewards from the envisaged growth.Inclusive economic growth without equitable redistribution of ownership and management responsibilities of all means of production and structure of economy.In bringing excluded races on board in terms of ownership, management, control and active participation in the economy, there is value to be created and responsibility to be exercised by those excluded racial sectors of our population.Their exclusion was not naturally or divinely ordained, but it is a product of deliberately planned social and political re-engineering to bring the poor people where they are today in a well-endowed country with huge natural resources, on the one hand and the highest levels of inequality and unemployment in the world, on the other hand.South Africa s transformation project to escape the legacy of apartheid witnesses a failure of great magnitude owing to its inability to progress beyond economic stagnation to the stage of meeting legitimate demands and expectations of delivering a developmental state and a better life to the underprivileged blacks despite a number of policies, programmes and strategies that were adopted by the democratic state since 1994.For many underprivileged citizens, transformation has not yielded desirable economic policy outcomes to meet the legitimate expectations of the marginalised citizens, as promised opportunities continue to remain a pie in the sky to many people.They remain stuck in the deprivation trap of underdevelopment, characterised by poverty, inequality, unemployment, high dependency ratio, racism, corruption and homelessness. The longer it takes South Africa to transform and overcome these societal structural challenges, the more likely that transformation project will lose credibility in the eyes of the supposed beneficiaries.MBB MahlanguMBB Mahlangu is a public policy analyst and writes in his personal capacity
