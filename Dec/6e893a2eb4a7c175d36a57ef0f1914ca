The Eiffel Tower reopened to the public on Sunday after a labour strike closed the Paris landmark for five days.Members of the 300-strong workforce voted Sunday to resume their duties following a dispute over management&#8217;s decision-making and maintenance work, the CGT union said.Unions and management are to sign a memorandum of understanding, the union said, without disclosing its contents.During the Christmas rush as many as 20,000 people a day ascend the tower.Among the projects that workers are concerned about are a major paint-stripping and repainting job to repair flaking areas of the 117-year-old tower which unions say poses health risks because of lead in the old paint.-AFP
