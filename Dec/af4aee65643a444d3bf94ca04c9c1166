Lady Gaga has released the music video for her single &#8220;A Million Reasons.&#8221;The clip sees the singer pick up where she left off on her last video, &#8220;Perfect Illusion,&#8221; which ends with her swerving through the desert in a car.&#8220;A Million Reasons&#8221; sees her rescued by friends, in between shots of the star singing with her guitar in a pink trouser suit and hat, and a black-and-white montage of her getting emotional while preparing for a shoot.&#8220;A Million Reasons&#8221; is the latest video to come from Gaga&#8217;s fifth studio album &#8220;Joanne,&#8221; which debuted back in October. -Relaxnews
