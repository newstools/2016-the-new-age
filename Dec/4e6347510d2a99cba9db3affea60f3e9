The Western Cape department of transport and public works yesterday announced that the R8m construction of the long-awaited Vredenburg clinic, was well on its way to completion.The construction of the health facility in Louwville started in March.The clinic, which was originally a library, was commissioned by the department of transport and public works for the Western Cape department of health to respond to an increase in patient numbers.Spokesperson for the department, Byron la Hoe, said: The construction of the long-awaited new clinic in Louwville, Vredenburg is nearing completion. This R8m project was to convert the community library building into a health facility. The construction started in March and should be complete in March 2017, if all goes according to plan. Once complete, the new facility will be fully accessible to people with disabilities. It will offer primary healthcare services including the treatment of infectious diseases, curative and chronic care and rehabilitation services. The clinic will have separate consultation rooms, wound care and treatment rooms, as well as a pharmacy. La Hoe said: When it opens, the new clinic will help to give effect to the Healthcare 2030 aim of providing high-quality health facilities for the people of the Western Cape at district hospital and primary healthcare level. Modernising and maintaining our health infrastructure is central to delivering on that commitment. When our infrastructure is fit for the purpose, the provincial government is able to provide the quality patientcentred care which people can rely on. nadinef@thenewage.co.za
