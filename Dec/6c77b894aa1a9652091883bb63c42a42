Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called for the country to reinforce its military nuclear potential and praised the army&#8217;s performance in its Syria campaign.In a speech that recapped military activities in 2016, Putin said the army&#8217;s preparedness has &#8220;considerably increased&#8221; and called for continued improvement that would ensure it can &#8220;neutralise any military threat&#8221;.&#8220;We need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces, especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defence systems,&#8221; the Kremlin strongman said.&#8220;We must carefully monitor any changes in the balance of power and in the political-military situation in the world, especially along Russian borders, and quickly adapt plans for neutralising threats to our country.&#8221;He said Russia&#8217;s military had successfully demonstrated its capabilities in Syria, showcased its technology to potential arms buyers and helped the Syrian army make considerable advances.&#8220;The Syrian army received considerable support, thanks to which it carried out several successful operations against militants,&#8221; he said.&#8220;The effective use of Russian weapons in Syria opens new possibilities for military-technical cooperation.&#8220;We must take maximum advantage of this. We know there is interest in modern Russian weapons from foreign partners.&#8221;Russia began its bombing campaign in Syria in September 2015 in support of President Bashar al-Assad, with its special forces also operating on the ground in the country.Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the military had used &#8220;162 types of modern armaments during the military campaign in Syria,&#8221; including its Sukhoi warplanes and MiG and Kamov helicopters.&#8220;They have shown to be highly effective,&#8221; he said.&#8211; &#8216;35,000 fighters&#8217; &#8211;Shoigu produced figures for the entire campaign in Syria but did not mention any estimate of civilian casualties.Russian warplanes have &#8220;liquidated 725 training camps, 405 weapon factories and workshops, 1,500 pieces of terrorist equipment, and 35,000 fighters, including 204 field commanders,&#8221; he said.The Russian airforce has conducted a total of 18,800 sorties and carried out 71,000 strikes since the start of its campaign, Shoigu said.&#8220;In general, the operation has allowed (us) to solve several geopolitical problems,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We have considerably damaged international terrorist organisations in Syria, stopped their expansion&#8230; (and) prevented the breakup of Syria.&#8221;Russia is prioritising its Asian partners including India and China for arms sales, he added.Shoigu said NATO activities along Russia&#8217;s western borders have grown eight-fold over the past decade, forcing Moscow to send more warplanes to prevent breaches of Russian airspace.Next year, four additional S-400 anti-missile defence systems will be delivered to the army, and Russia will pay particular attention to its Western flank and the Arctic, he said.&#8220;First and foremost, we will continue to increase military capabilities&#8230; take measures to reinforce troops in the western, southwestern and Arctic strategic sectors,&#8221; Shoigu said.-AFP
