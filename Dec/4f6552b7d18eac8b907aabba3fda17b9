Organisers for the Nelson Mandela Legacy Cup say the inclusion of former South African cricket captain Graeme Smith was a massive coup for the Springboks encounter against the Proteas.The T20 match takes place at PPC Newlands in Cape Town tomorrow. An added bonus to the festivities will be Blitzbokke captain Philip Snyman and his 15 counterparts from the participating teams in this weekend s HSBC Cape Town Sevens in attendance.Smith s inclusion is seen as the final piece in the Bok puzzle for this highly anticipated match almost two years to the day since the rugby players beat their cricketing counterparts by five wickets at the Wanderers, thanks mainly to the 62 runs by Victor Matfield and three wickets apiece by Damian de Allende and Willie le Roux.Pat Lambie, who will lead the Boks tomorrow, said he would lean heavily on Smith s experience against the high-flying Proteas. Smith captained the Proteas in 101 Tests and is the most successful Test captain in cricket history with 50 victories. We can t wait for the challenge and although we know the Proteas will be confident going into this encounter, we can hopefully make a good contest of it. To have Graeme as part of our team is a massive boost and he will definitely play a key role for us with the bat and ball. His international T20 batting average is just shy of 32 and his off-breaks will come in very handy on the Newlands pitch, Lambie said. Our technical analysts have been hard at work in the last few days to see if we can find any weaknesses in the Proteas armour, but that is easier said than done and we ll just have to rely on our skills and experience on the day.
