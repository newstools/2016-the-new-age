Opposition parties reached agreement Saturday with the government on a deal to end a political crisis over DR Congo President Joseph Kabila&#8217;s fate that has caused months of deadly unrest, a church mediator and officials said.The talks were launched by the Roman Catholic church to ward off violence as Kabila&#8217;s second and final mandate ended on December 20 with no sign of him stepping down and no election in sight.&#8220;We have reached agreement on all points,&#8221; said Marcel Utembi, who chairs the Episcopal Conference (CENCO) overseeing the talks.&#8220;There will be a plenary session at 8:00pm (1900 GMT) to formally adopt it and a solemn signing ceremony at 8:30pm.&#8221;Justice Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba confirmed a deal had been reached, saying: &#8220;Everything is settled.&#8221;However a spokesman for Kabila&#8217;s longtime rival, Etienne Tshisekedi, said negotiators would submit the deal to the 84-year-old opposition leader for approval before returning to sign the accord.&#8220;We want to be absolutely sure&#8221; (of Tshisekedi&#8217;s response), said his advisor Valentin Mubake.A working document for the deal previously seen by AFP proposed a &#8220;political transition&#8221; with fresh presidential elections to be held at the end of 2017. A prime minister would come from opposition ranks.That document also guaranteed Kabila would not seek a third mandate.In return, the opposition would accept that Kabila remain in office until he hands over to an elected successor.The opposition had previously demanded his immediate departure from public life.-AFP
