The South African Football Association (SAFA) has dismissed rumours linking former Ajax Cape Town coach Roger de Sa to the Bafana Bafana coaching job. SAFA CEO Dennis Mumble said there is no vacancy for that position. In normal circumstances, I would not even want to respond to such speculation but for the sake of football loving fans, would like to put the record straight by unequivocally dismissing such rumours. People must understand there is a process which is underway and must await its conclusive outcome, said Mumble. No one must speculate or anticipate any outcome of this matter and no one must generate expectation around the position of Bafana Bafana coach because the post is not vacant, he added.Mashaba was suspended by his employers after he allegedly insulted SAFA president Danny Jordaan after Bafana beat Senegal 2-1 in the 2018 World Cup qualifier against Senegal at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday.
