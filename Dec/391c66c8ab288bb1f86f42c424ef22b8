It would not be far-fetched to suggest that Orlando Pirates owe their promising league run to prolific striker Tendai Ndoro.Sitting at the top of the PSL s scoring charts with 11 goals, Ndoro has also been the main subject of discussion for Pirates fans this season.And averaging a goal a game, not many can bet against the Zimbabwean hitman scoring against Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium tonight.He has been the catalyst for the four wins Pirates have registered in the league netting 11 of the 13 goals the entire Pirates team have managed to net so far this season.It s a statistic that has even left coach Augusto Palacios baffled, unable to understand how a team with so many international stars can rely so heavily on on man. It s true that we struggle when Ndoro doesn t score but this is not to say the opportunities aren t there for others to take the responsibility, Palacios said. Most of our players play for their national teams, so the experience is there. But scoring is another thing, we need to work on it. With the 28-year-old Ndoro fully fit for the crunch clash against Maritzburg, Palacios will be feeling confident of victory, which would see them dislodge Bidvest Wits from third place. I don t feel any pressure, Ndoro said. If I score, my teammates are happy for me. If someone else scores, we are all happy. I don t like to set myself targets because I don t want to put myself under pressure; I just prefer to take it one day at a time. KGOMOTSO SETHUSHAkgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
