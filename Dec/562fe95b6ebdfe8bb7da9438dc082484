APARTHEID S spatial planning continues exacerbating black poverty, as poor people still struggle to uplift themselves economically because they live on the outskirts with no job opportunities. Entitled Edged Out Spatial Mismatch and Spatial Justice in South Africa s main urban areas, the report by the Socio-economic Rights Institute of South Africa (Seri) found that apartheid s legacy was still evident . It finds that housing for the poor tends to be located far away from job opportunities. This creates a poverty trap whereby living on the periphery leads to poverty, while poverty ensures living on the periphery. Significant structural features of the South African economy make people poor and keep them so, the report stated.SA has one of the worst unemployment rates in the world at more than 26%. The report said even though black people worked in areas reserved for white people under the apartheid administration, the planning explicitly designed to prevent urban workers from living in well-located white areas .Seri said the planning, which compelled black people to live in the former homelands, meant a number of poor people were excluded from opportunities. The report called on the government to ensure the poor were allocated houses in communities with opportunities. Seri calls on all levels of the government to intervene in housing and land markets to provide well-located and affordable housing for the poor. This will be central to dismantling the apartheid city and moving towards spatial justice in urban areas. 701233
