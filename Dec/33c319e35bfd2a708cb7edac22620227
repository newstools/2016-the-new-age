Mamelodi Sundowns will open their 2016 Fifa Club World Cup campaign against J1 League champions Kashima Antlers of Japan at the Suita City Football stadium in Osaka on Sunday.Sundowns, who qualified for the tournament by virtue of being CAF Champions League winners, have been in Japan since Tuesday.Kashima made it to the quarterfinals by beating New Zealand outfit Auckland City 2-1 in the first round.Just as Sundowns are feared and respected in the Absa Premiership, they face a formidable side in Kashima, who are by far Japan s most successful club team having won the J1 League a record eight times.The club also has six J1 League Cups to their name as well as four Emperor s Cup titles since the league s inception 23 years ago.Sundowns will not be intimidated by the home side as they have managed to withstand hostile environments in matches in Egypt and the Democratic Republic of Congo during the CAF Champions League.Khama Billiat, who is one of the players expected to set the stage alight for Sundowns, said the Brazilians will be ready for anything in Japan. We are prepared for anything because we are aware that all the teams that made it to the tournament are champions in their own right. We also go there having won our league and the Champions League. That is from where we draw the belief that we can go on and win games in the Club World Cup, Billiat said. We cannot doubt ourselves and rate our opponents more than we rate ourselves. What everyone should know is that we will give it our best shot and fight hard to go to the next round. If Sundowns emerge victorious on Sunday, they will go on to face South American champions Atl ttico Nacional on Wednesday afternoon.This will be the first time that a South African side participates at the prestigious Fifa Club World Cup since the tournament s inception in 2000.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANEmmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
