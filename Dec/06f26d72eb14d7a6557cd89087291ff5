Home Affairs has eased some of the visa regulations for parents travelling with children in and out of the country.Yesterday Home Affairs directorgeneral Mkuseli Apleni said the department had developed a prototype of the required amendments to the South African passport and travel documents to include parents details in the child s passport so that they do not have to carry birth certificates when travelling.This follows concerns over new visa and passport regulations, which required parents to carry their children s unabridged birth certificates when travelling and if only one parent was travelling with the child, they would need an affidavit no older than six months from the second parent giving permission for the child to travel.An interministerial committee was established and yesterday Apleni unveiled some of the committee s recommendations. The term unabridged birth certificate will be changed to birth certificate containing parents details , he said. He said that the department, in conjunction with its appointed service provider, has to date established 30 visa application centres globally. In order to proceed with the establishment of these premium visa processing centres in Botswana, the United Arab Emirates and Zimbabwe, the department reassessed and updated its contractual framework with VFS Global. The department has mandated VFS to expand footprint operations into a further seven additional centres located in Senegal, Egypt, Russia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tehran and the Philippines, he said.Apleni said the decision by Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba to grant a visa waiver for ordinary passport holders of the Russian Federation for a period of 90 days was approved on February 18 this year. This development is in addition to the visa exemption that South Africa signed with the Russian Federation for diplomatic and official passport holders. The waiver is based on the principle of reciprocity with the Russian Federation to also concede such a waiver for South African nationals, he said.Apleni said forcing travellers from visa exempt countries to carry documentation in support of an unabridged birth certificate has been put on hold awaiting further engagements.He also touched on foreign students in the country. Foreign graduates from South African tertiary institutions in the area of critical skills are able to apply for permanent residence status in order to use the knowledge they acquired to the benefit of the South African economy.This decision has already been implemented, Apleni said.He said the regulations did not harm tourism as tourists increased by 10.7% in September this year compared to the same time last year.BATANDWA MALINGObatandwam@thenewage.co.za
