Nelson Mandela Children&#8217;s Hospital will officially open its doors to its first patients in Parktown, Johannesburg on Friday.The long awaited hospital, which was constructed for over 2 years, will have a dedicated specialist paediatric facility.This is known to be Nelson Mandela&#8217;s most cherished dreams to create a specialist paediatric hospital. It has been more than 10 years after Mandela conceived the idea, the visionary dream has finally materialised.CEO of Nelson Mandela Children&#8217;s Fund Sibongile Mkhabela said: &#8220;we will be dealing with heart and heart issues and surgical.&#8221;Mkhabela said it will mostly prioritise surgical patients. It will work on kidney, issues of bone marrow, cancers amongst children and those of a high level of complication.Mandela officially commenced the project in 2009 at a site of an old cricket ground.The hospital will be a 200-bed facility with state-of-the-arts equipment.&#8220;We needed a R100 million dollars, we had not a penny. We then had to go out and find money, we couldn&#8217;t get banks to finance us. There was no way we could pay it back.&#8220;We were looking for people who were going to donate. We marketed it as a shared legacy,&#8221; Mkhabela said.The hospital will offer free services for those from poor backgrounds and charge those who can afford its services.Mandela Kids Hospital Trust Joe Seoloane said: &#8221; The majority of the children will be unable to pay and no child therefore will be turned away because they cannot pay. But those who are able to pay we would like them to pay, or otherwise we cannot sustain the hospital.Operational costs will be funded by government and the other portion will be funded by cash paying patients.The Hospital will be the second paediatric hospital in the country, and the fifth in the continent.Africa has four other paediatric specialist hospitals one in Cape Town and Nairobi, and two in Cairo with the new Johannesburg hospital an addition and the most advanced facility.-KEITUMETSI MOTLHALE
