The pain of losing two babies who died due to cholera-like symptoms in Bloemhof s Boitumelong township two years ago has turned into relief after the community received an R8m water treatment plant.This means residents can now move away from the bucket toilet system to a water-based one with improved hygiene.Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane recently handed over the plant.She said it was refurbished in memory of two children, Kabo Wageng and Onalenna Mogoregi, who died after drinking contaminated water in 2014.Parents of the deceased were present at the handover ceremony and they expressed relief that their children did not die in vain.The mother of Wageng thanked the government for fulfilling its promise. After our kids died we were promised that the waste water treatment plant would be upgraded to avoid issues of contamination. We are happy today that the government has kept its promise. Their names are written on the plaque that has just been unveiled by the minister. Whenever we miss them we will come here and feel better, she said.Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati district executive mayor Boitumelo Mahlangu, made a commitment that tombstones would also be erected in memory of the two children this month. In the spirit of one of the fifth administration missions, reconciliation, healing and renewal, will have an important event where will be unveiling tombstones for those kids who died after drinking contaminated water, she said.Mokonyane said that never again should children die due to drinking contaminated water. Three days after my appointment as the Minister of Water and Sanitation, we heard of the tragedy that happened here in Boitumelong when two newborn babies died after drinking contaminated water. We are here today in memory of those children, opening a plant and eradicating the bucket system, she said.The minister called on all residents to be the eyes and ears of the government by protecting the various facilities which were being provided to improve the lives of the communities. We have just handed over an upgraded waste water treatment plant to the municipality which will ensure that waste is treated at an acceptable standard. The municipality has to further ensure that it employs people with relevant skills to operate the plant, Mokonyane said.She also said that ageing infrastructure, working in silos by departments with sanitation budgets, vandalism of infrastructure by communities and lack of dedicated budgets for operation and maintenance of sanitation infrastructure are some of the main challenges that need to be carefully looked at to ensure that challenges around provision of decent sanitation is holistically addressed.The government has also vowed to eradicate the bucket toilets in the area so that there is improvement in the general hygiene of the communities.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
