Gauteng traffic police is currently running an operation at the major taxi ranks across Gauteng to detect vehicles that are not roadworthy. The operation aims to help the police impound taxi&#8217;s that are not roadworthy. So far 38 minibus taxis have been impounded already while a number of drivers have been arrested for failing to carry their licenses with them . The Gauteng traffic police says road fatalities have increased since the start of this month as over 800 people have been killed on the country&#8217;s roads. The traffic police&#8217;s Busaphi Nxumalo emphasised that un-roadworthy vehicles will be impounded with immediate effect . &#8220;There is no taxi that is going to leave the province overloaded or un-roadworthy as these contributes to more fatalities,&#8221;said Nxumalo. Nxumalo also said that traffic police officers will be deployed to major taxi ranks to sure that all public transport vehicles leaving the ranks are roadworthy. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to continue to deploy our officers on all the major taxi ranks in the province, to ensure that all public transport vehicles leaving the ranks are roadworthy. We&#8217;re tired of seeing people dying on our roads,&#8221;said Nxumalo. Meanwhile on Tuesday Transport Minister Dipuo Peters earlier this week said that more than 800 fatalities have been recorded on the country&#8217;s roads since the first of December. -TNA Reporter
