Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will be among those who will address delegates at the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa s (Denosa s) 20th anniversary celebration at the Union Buildings today.Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini and a number of veteran nurses will join more than 3000 nurses from across the country who will mark the milestone anniversary.Denosa said that it has achieved a lot in its 20 years of existence including securing the introduction of uniform allowances in 2005 at the bargaining council, concluding an agreement on danger allowance for nurses in psychiatric facilities and winning its campaign for the establishment of a chief nursing officer position within the department of health waged since 2006.Their battle culminated in victory when the department appointed a chief nursing officer in 2014.But there are still many challenges facing the profession. The organisation is still grappling with many challenges in the profession, which poses a threat in the delivery of quality healthcare to patients by nurses, Denosa said.The union said while it had achieved a lot, the severe shortage of nurses remains a major problem because it results in the burnout of nurses in public sector facilities who are overburdened and streched to the limit.The lack of safety measures in most healthcare facilities and payment of danger allowances to nurses who work in casualty, TB units and community health centres among its challenges.Denosa s 20 years in the sector will be celebrated under the theme, 20 Years of Uniting Nurses, underlining its success in advancing the interests of nurses in South Africa and the African region.The organisation credits itself for spearheading efforts for the formation of the Southern African Network of Nurses a regional body for nurses in the SADC region and assisting nurses in the DRC to establish a nursing regulatory body.Earlier this year, a Limpopo nurse was attacked and killed by a psychiatric patient at Hayani Psychiatric Hospital in Sibasa near Thohoyandou while on duty.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
