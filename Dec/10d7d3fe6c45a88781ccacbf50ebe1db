The 15th annual Kwanzaa celebrations is set to officially open at the Constitution Hill on Boxing Day.It is a week-long celebration held in the US and in other nations of the Western African diaspora in the Americas.The celebration honours African heritage and is observed from December 26 to January 1, culminating in a feast and gift-giving.The theme for the event is Breaking Barriers Building Bridges, a call to all Africans to engage in practical transformation.The opening will be celebrated with programmes including music, poetry, short speeches and separate programmes for children and the youth. There will also be an African market and a variety of foods on sale.The event is hosted in collaboration with Ebukhosini Solutions, a community-based company specialising in African-centred solutions to social, political and cultural challenges.Ebukhosini Solutions programme coordinator Tebogo Buntu said: There is a new wind of decolonisation blowing across the continent where people, especially the younger generation, are opposing Westernised education, eurocentric values and foreign concepts. A return to indigenous roots is rapidly emerging. This speaks to the need for a progressive process in which Africans seek to control their economies, take custodianship over their resources, manage their societies and shape the continent s development through indigenous knowledge and practices, he said.He said that the celebration of Kwanzaa provided a platform upon which Africans could unite despite their many differences. Under the theme, we highlight the need for Africans to critically engage in an initiative to collectively build a future that every African can be proud of and instinctively want to protect and preserve for the long lineage of Africans to come, he said.Baba Buntu, executive director of Ebukhosini Solutions said: Kwanzaa is directly linked to research on southern African traditional ceremonies. So, far from being something new, Kwanzaa is a continuation of what Africans always have done, he said.KUTULLO MADISHAkutullom@thenewage.co.za
