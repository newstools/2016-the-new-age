Britain&#8217;s Finance Minister Philip Hammond said Monday that a transitional arrangement could be &#8220;helpful&#8221; to smooth the country&#8217;s exit from the European Union.The government intends to begin the formal exit process by the end of March, starting the clock ticking on a two-year deadline to negotiate its departure and future relationship with the bloc.Hammond said there was an &#8220;emerging view&#8221; that &#8220;having a longer period to manage the adjustment between where we are now, as full members of the European Union, and where we get to in the future&#8230; would be generally helpful&#8221;.It &#8220;would tend towards a smoother transition and would run less risks of disruption including, crucially, risks to financial stability which must be a fairly real concern&#8221;, he told parliament&#8217;s Treasury committee.This view was held by businesses, regulators, &#8220;thoughtful politicians&#8221; and civil servants on both sides of the English Channel, he said.The European Commission&#8217;s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, warned last week: &#8220;As we don&#8217;t know what the UK wants and is waiting for, it&#8217;s difficult to imagine a transitional period.&#8221;Hammond conceded: &#8220;We can only get to a situation where we have a transition if there is a genuine meeting of minds on both sides of this negotiation.&#8221;The CBI business lobby group warned last month of a &#8220;cliff-edge&#8221; where Britain leaves the EU after two years without a new trading arrangement in place.Hammond said: &#8220;It&#8217;s not just the business sector, it&#8217;s the government sector that has had to think about how long it takes to make changes, hire people, train people, introduce IT changes.&#8221;He noted that the possible reintroduction of border and customs checks would require many more officials to be trained, a process that would cost money and time. Government split on approach to Brexit Hammond campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU and, while backing the government&#8217;s promise to implement the June referendum vote to leave, is widely viewed as pressing for a &#8220;soft&#8221; Brexit.Others in Prime Minister Theresa May&#8217;s cabinet, such as international trade secretary Liam Fox, want a swift, decisive break with Brussels.Brexit minister David Davis said last week that Britain would seek to agree both its withdrawal and a future trade deal with the EU within the two-year timeframe. However, that goal is under pressure after Barnier said that the negotiations must be completed within 18 months to allow time for ratification.Hammond&#8217;s comments came ahead of a House of Lords report released on Tuesday, which said Britain needs to draw up transitional arrangements to carry on trading with the EU after Brexit while they negotiate a long-term trade deal.&#8221;Although this would require clarity on the principles of what the UK is transitioning to, it would not delay the UK&#8217;s withdrawal.&#8220;But it would safeguard current trade and provide adequate time for negotiations,&#8221; the joint report by the House of Lords&#8217; EU Internal Market and External Affairs Sub-committees said.Negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement with Brussels would not be possible within the two-year period set out for Brexit talks, the report said.-AFP
