IT GOES without saying Orlando Pirates coach Augusto Palacios will have nothing glowing to say about his players in his mid-season report. Judging by his reaction to the shock defeat to Bloemfontein Celtic this week, Palacios will certainly spare no holy cows in his assessment of the team, who have overwhelmingly underperformed since he took charge on an interim basis last month. Palacios is expected to submit a report with recommendations.He again questioned the players commitment to the team s course after they slumped to a dispiriting 2-1 loss to Celtic and fell short of calling them unworthy of the Pirates jersey. We have new players who don t understand what it means to be here, Palacios said. We need players with character for a big team. The players need to have more hunger. They need to understand where they are and not playing for just a salary. This jersey is heavy and players need to know that they need to wear it with pride. Palacios replaced Muhsin Ertugral in early November and got his tenure off to a bright start, winning two matches. But it has been downhill with two draws followed by two defeats, which have left the Buccaneers in eighth spot with 18 points after 13 games.Goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane was singled out for criticism for his performance against Celtic. The games that we have lost will not be coming back. I am very disappointed and I cannot sleep, Palacios said. You can practice for weeks but then when mistakes happen like what happened to Jackson, what are you going to say? The players will say: Sorry coach . Sorry for what, when the game is finished? I cannot speak to Jackson. What are you going to tell him? He is a human being and he makes mistakes. The answer for me is three points and I cannot go to him, to tell him what? kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za-Kgomotso Sethusha
