Just days before &#8220;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&#8221; lands at the cinema, US apparel brand Columbia is premiering a new line of clothes inspired by the film&#8217;s characters.There will be three jackets, each modelled after one of the film&#8217;s three main characters &#8211; Sergeant Jyn Erso, Captain Cassian Andor, and the Imperial Death Trooper.The Jyn Erso Rebel Jacket features rugged leather effect details just like the character&#8217;s on-screen clothing and a detachable quilted vest that can be worn separately.The Imperial Death Trooper Jacket&#8217;s ouster pattern and zipper positions mimic the lines and proportions of the character&#8217;s armour.&#8220;We are extremely pleased to announce a first of its kind, outerwear collaboration with Lucasfilm,&#8221; said Joe Boyle, Senior VP of Columbia Brand Merchandising and Design.The jackets will go on sale in very limited quantities on December 9 and will retail from $400-$500.-Relaxnews
