FIFA&#8217;s Ethics Committee has opened proceedings against Nigeria&#8217;s Amos Adamu for an ethics violation, the world football governing body said on Tuesday.Adamu has already served a three-year ban from all football-related activities for accepting bribes in relation to the attribution of the 2018 World Cup to Russia and 2022 tournament to Qatar.He now faces another two-year suspension and 20,000 Swiss franc fine ($19,445, 18,724 euros) for further ethics violations, a FIFA statement said.An investigation into Adamu, a former FIFA executive committee member and West African Football Union president, was opened on March 9, 2015.A final report was passed to FIFA&#8217;s adjudicatory chamber earlier this month recommending a sanction, after which ethics committee chairman Hans-Joachim Eckert decided to open proceedings.FIFA said it would make no further comment on the case &#8220;for reasons linked to privacy rights and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty&#8221;.World football&#8217;s governing body has been in turmoil since last year due to a number of corruption scandals, including that of a two million Swiss franc payment made by former president Sepp Blatter to ex-UEFA supremo Michel Platini that saw both men banned from the game.&#8211; AFP
