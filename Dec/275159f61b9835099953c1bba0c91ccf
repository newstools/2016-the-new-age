Bournemouth thrashed Swansea 3-0 with first-half strikes from Benik Afobe and Ryan Fraser followed by a late one from Joshua King on Saturday, leaving the Swans nailed to the bottom of the Premier League table.Eddie Howe&#8217;s Cherries took the lead in the 25th minute with Afobe scoring from close range on the rebound after Jordi Amat narrowly avoided deflecting the ball into his own net.Fraser raced into the area in stoppage-time at the end of the half to smash in a Junior Stanislas cross, doubling the visitors&#8217; lead.Swansea, under caretaker manager Alan Curtis, struggled to gain possession throughout the second half, before Bournemouth substitute Joshua King shot past goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to seal the win.-Reuters
