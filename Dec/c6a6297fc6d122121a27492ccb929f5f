Egypt agreed to postpone a UN Security Council resolution against Israeli settlements when US President-elect Donald Trump called President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the presidency said Friday.Egypt had requested on Thursday that its resolution demanding Israel halt settlements be postponed after Israel launched a frantic lobbying effort.&#8220;The phone call touched on the draft resolution before the United Nations Security Council on Israeli settlements,&#8221; a statement from Sisi&#8217;s office said.&#8220;The two leaders agreed on the importance of giving the new administration a chance to deal comprehensively with all the aspects of the Palestinian cause to achieve a comprehensive settlement,&#8221; it said.Trump, who had campaigned on a promise to recognise Jerusalem as Israel&#8217;s capital, bluntly said Washington should use its veto to block the resolution.&#8220;The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed,&#8221; he said in a statement.Sisi, a former military chief who overthrew his Islamist predecessor in 2013 in a move condemned by Obama, has expressed admiration for Trump.He told the Financial Times in a recent interiew that he was &#8220;very optimistic&#8221; about Trump.&#8220;President-elect Trump is tackling terrorism with more resolve and seriousness and that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s needed now, he said.The ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 unleashed a bloody crackdown on his followers that killed hundreds of protesters.A jihadist insurgency since has killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers, mostly in the eastern Sinai Peninsula.&nbsp;-AFP
