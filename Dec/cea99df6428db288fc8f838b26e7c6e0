We salute him for his courage and his contribution will never be forgotten,&#8221; said Zuma in a statement.Mokhothu died on Monday after a coalition of the Mayi Mayi and Allied Democratic Forces rebel groups attacked the position of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) near Butembu in the Beni region of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).&#8220;On behalf of government and all South Africans, we wish to extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, relatives and colleagues. Our prayers and thoughts are with them in this difficult period.
