The ANC Youth League (ANCYL) yesterday said that the pendulum would not swing in favour of Cosatu and the Young Communist League (YCL) in seeing to it that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa takes over the reins of the ANC.Speaking to The New Age, ANCYL deputy president Desmond Moela said that while the trade union federation and the communists had the right to raise their views concerning their endorsement of Ramaphosa to lead the ANC next year, Cosatu and the YCL did not enjoy voting rights at the party s elective conference that will elect a new president. The YCL is not voting at the conference, they must canvass their proposal in the branches of the ANC and workers (Cosatu) will not be voting in the ANC conference, Moela said.It is for this that he said the ANC s alliance partners influence would be limited. He said that the young lions would get their way in electing a woman president to lead the ANC. It is us, the branches of the ANC who will be voting, but as the ANCYL we are saying that we are ready to led by a woman president. Moela s comments come against the background of the ANC s succession debate gaining momentum despite attempts being made by the ANC to keep a lid on the matter. The YCL at the weekend publicly endorsed Ramaphosa as its preferred candidate to succeed President Jacob Zuma.This comes hot on the heels of Cosatu s central executive committee decision to back the former trade unionist.Moela, making reference to Cosatu s call for the ANC to follow the tradition that its deputy succeeds the president when his or her term of office ends, said that the practice did not feature in the ANC s constitution. The tradition that says a deputy president must lead is not in the constitution of the ANC, he said.Moela offered doubtful support for the 101 group of ANC stalwarts and veterans who called for an ANC consultative conference as part of a turnaround strategy to lift the ruling party out of its crisis. The veterans league is a veterans league of the ANC but it must not be seen to be driving the ANC because some veterans are implicated in dividing the ANC by putting in their own interests, he said.Moela said the ANCYL wanted to see the ANC emerge united after the party s elective conference. We want a united leadership of the ANC, not these clowns. We want a proper leadership of the ANC so that we can win the elections in 2019, he said.Bonolo Selebanobonolos@thenewage.co.za
