ABOUT 43 000 residents of Lesotho have received their Lesotho special permit (LSP) to date, the director general at the home affairs department, Mkuseli Apleni, said.Apleni and his counterpart from the Mountain Kingdom of Lesotho, the principal secretary for home affairs, Borenahabokhete Sekoyela, yesterday conducted a special permit drive at the Maseru border.Apleni said a total of 177 000 special permits had been initiated but only 83 000 had been paid and payments had to be made by December 31 which meant applicants only had a few days before the deadline.Lesotho residents who were already in South Africa, whether working or studying before September last year would not be deported if they did not have proper documentation but all of them had to apply for proper documents. The LSP is meant to ease the cross border red tape for frequent travellers and to ease the travel requirements for residents of Lesotho who travel frequently to South Africa.Apleni said all registered Lesotho residents would qualify for frequent traveller concession where only fingerprints will be used when they cross the border to South Africa. Illegal Basotho who have not completed applications or have not applied by the end of March will be deported. A moratorium not to deport will be lifted on March 31.Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba said Lesotho residents who had criminal records or were wanted by police for crimes in South Africa would not qualify. Special permit recipients will get a smart card that will be scanned.kamogelos@thenewage.co.za-Kamogelo Seekoei
