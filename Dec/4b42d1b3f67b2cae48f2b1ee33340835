The South African Police Service (SAPS) and the Hawks has urged people to be be extra vigilant during this Festive season as it is the time whereby ATM card swapping crimes are most prevalent.This follows the arrest of a man by the Serious Commercial Crime unit of the Hawks in the Eastern Cape of an alleged ATM card swapping syndicate.The suspect is the 13th to be arrested for an alleged ATM card swapping syndicate.Eastern Cape police Captain Anelisa Feni suggested ways in which the public can be more cautious this season such as not allowing people to help when performing a transaction at an ATM.&#8220;Only receive help from the staff of the bank. If your card is swallowed by the machine, immediately phone the number written on the ATM machine where you can cancel your card.&#8220;Card swapping and the withdrawal of the cash all happens in a few minutes, therefore, phone the number immediately and cancel your card in order to prevent loss,&#8221; Feni said.&nbsp;-TNA Reporter
