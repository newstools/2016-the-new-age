South Africa is one of the most advanced countries in Africa and boasts a Constitution that can compete with the rest of the world.Abortion was legalised in South Africa 25 years ago and it is reported that the demand for abortion is high between 2500 and 3000 a month.However, despite our modern legislation, the most shocking reality is that this country is still met with illegal and extremely dangerous and exorbitantly priced back street abortionists dispensing medication to any woman seeking an abortion.A woman of any age has the legal right to receive a free abortion up to 12 weeks. The woman can also receive an abortion legally up to 20 weeks if there is an exceptional reason for example socio-economic issues, rape, if you feel that you are not ready to have a child and so on.The Culture of Illegal Abortions in South Africa by Dr Rebecca Jane Hodes, says: The legalisation of abortion in South Africa has significantly improved the health of women. One study found a 91% decrease in abortion-related mortality between 1998 and 2001, due to the provision of legal abortion in the public health sector. Another found reductions in both the number of women presenting with incomplete abortions and the number of deaths due to abortion. These findings show the public health benefits of the Choice Act. However, besides these positive figures the right to a legal abortion is often missed and women jump straight into an illegal abortion, why is that?There is still a stigma floating around surrounding abortion which is difficult to comprehend in a country as liberal and free (to some extent) like South Africa.Abortion is a very sensitive subject that is often judged on religious teachings and personal morals as well as values. Society is afraid to talk openly about abortion and because of this, ignorant theories about abortion start to surface.Abortion is often thought of something which is a result of a social ill like promiscuity and it cannot be that simple. Society cannot fathom or understand that a little girl or a grown woman for the matter can be a sexual being and it cannot be concluded that because someone is a sexual being they cannot have the option to abort.A woman can have a plethora of reasons for choosing to abort for example, in many cases, the pregnancy could have occurred out of sheer violence, such as rape.Hodes, an expert on the subject of abortion, said studies have shown that woman do not abort due to sexual promiscuity but because they simply cannot afford to have a child financially or they are not mentally or emotionally ready for a child.A simple person would then ask, why have unprotected sex? Firstly, some women do not have the power to negotiate safe sex in relationships. Secondly, people are not informed with respect to contraceptives and their sexual health nor can they afford these resources and, thirdly, women do not exercise their right to take control of their sexual health due to hostile healthcare facilities.South Africa is not a society which makes it easy for any woman to look after as well as take full responsibility for her sexual health.Most South Africans do not have medical aid and are reduced to state resources, government clinics and state hospitals.Hodes stated in her paper that: In South Africa, the personal politics of many healthcare workers are profoundly at odds with the legal commitment and the public health imperative to provide comprehensive reproductive healthcare, including abortion. It is no secret that it has been reported that staff, particularly nursing staff, take it upon themselves to assert their morals and judgments in their environment, making it an uncomfortable experience for a woman seeking contraceptives, abortion or any procedure relating to their sexual health.What this does is create the stigma that abortion is something to be ashamed of and contributes to the rise in illegal abortions and then the illegal abortionists lurking in districts all over the country score yet another opportunity as they prey on vulnerable women and put these women s lives at risk for exorbitant fees.The only way to curb the stigma surrounding abortion is through education. When we are better informed we can systematically tackle social issues in South Africa.Sexual education cannot only rest in schools it needs to be something that parents are involved in as well.We cannot be embarrassed about things such as sex as we are sexual beings, young girls should be able to talk to their parents about their sexual health.Society as a whole needs to collectively support women in promoting their sexual health and slowly but surely we can eliminate these criminals who wander through the districts of Johannesburg preying on vulnerable women seeking an abortion.Canny MaphangaCanny Maphanga is a writer and commentator
