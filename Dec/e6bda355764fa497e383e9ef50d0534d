Next year, much like this year, will have its ups and downs, but everyone needs a place to live so the property market will continue to grow in some areas while it slows in others, warned analysts.It s up to sellers and buyers to do their homework and they must make sure that they get advice from property experts and make the smartest choices for their specific situations.This is according to Bruce Swain, managing director of Leapfrog Property, who said that the residential property market has had its ups and downs during this year as the economy stagnates, the Reserve Bank started hiking interest rates again and consumers struggled with household debt-toincome.What s in store for next year, slowing property price growth with a few notable exceptions an increase in demand for smaller properties, specifically sectional title and a tightening of the belt when it comes to household savings.Swain said while certain areas mainly in large urban centres like Cape Town and Johannesburg have done well during the year, the overall consensus is that property price growth has slowed down over the past seven months.According to the November FNB House Price Index this general slowing is due to lagging impact of a multi-year weakening in economic growth and possibly the impact of the interest rate hiking cycle. Regardless of what the economy is doing people still need a place to live so demand in the major metropolises will continue, mostly, unabated particularly in the R400000 to R1.2m price range, Swain said. The higher end of the market has struggled more, except in certain hot spots. The Western Cape has seen incredible property price growth specifically on Cape Town s Atlantic Seaboard driven by local migration from other provinces and by foreign buyers to some degree. Looking at other parts of the country we find good growth in Midrand and Vanderbjilpark (as more and more businesses move to these areas) in Gauteng and Durban North, Umhlanga Rocks and Ballito Bay in KwaZulu-Natal , Swain said.He said that in terms of the local economy South Africa is certainly in a difficult position and much needs to be changed if we re to avoid a ratings downgrade next year. However, if the rand stabilises at current levels or better and there is no major political squabbles, we don t expect further interest rate increases in 2017. This will help home owners but consumers must pay off all debts and also try to save by paying into a home loan as safeguards against a weak economy with an uncertain future, Swain said.Sello Rabothata |sellor@thenewage.co.za
