When Charlton Selemo, 39, participated in the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Systems (AMTS) programme four years ago, he did not think it would transform into a thriving business.The AMTS programme was held in partnership with the Department of Science and Technology.The AMTS provided his business with R40000 worth of printing machinery, while the department gave him the skills he needed to start his business.Selemo now uses the skills he gained to print his self-designed keyholders and souvenirs onto wood products and prints on Perspex, leather and steel, using laser printing and cutting. He then sells his finished products in the community where he lives.Selemo, the business sole designer, who runs his business hands on, said they mainly make money from selling souvenirs to the general public, but that they are trying to get into the corporate market so they could reach a bigger and broader audience. We do designs and testing. We also do offer sample products for the final products. Our production process could easily be done by many people but I do it myself, Selemo said.Selemo hopes tobreak into the manufacturing sector and to employ more people as his business grows.Statistics South Africa s September quarterly employment survey showed that an estimated 9 million people were employed in the formal non-agricultural sector of the South African economy. This reflects a net quarterly increase of 93000 employees between March and June 2016.During that period, 78000 people were employed in the community service industry, 7000 in trade and industry, 6000 in business service and construction, 2000 in the mining industry and 3000 in the transport industry.Selemo has managed to carve a living for himself in the manufacturing sector after failing to find more traditional forms of employment.He says he was lucky enough to spot a gap in the market in an industry he himself is trying to master.Selemo hopes to establish himself in Kimberley, grow his business, and create more job opportunities for others.According to him, getting people to understand his business has been a challenge, but he says he will try every method to get his product out there and into the public eye. I am pushing, exhibiting my products and I know that with maximum exposure to different markets, I will be able to pull through, he said.In a recent interview, Absa general manager for enterprise development Vicky Ramela said businesses fail because of a lack of business management and financial management skills.Ramela said businesses without the relevant skills often fail, especially within their first two years of establishment. We have discovered 80% of businesses fail due to cash flow problems and, in most cases, the entrepreneurs are left without direction, not knowing which steps to take next, she said. We do give (credit) support to businesses without sufficient credit records or security, but these businesses have to be very much specialised, she said.NOMUSA MVUBUnomusam@thenewage.co.za
