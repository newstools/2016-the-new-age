Eastern Cape MEC for Transport Weziwe Tikana and Western Cape MEC Donald Grant partnered in a launch of a road safety operation for this festive season in Graff-Reinet on Thursday.R61 Between Western (Beaufort West) and Graff Reinet is reported to be the higher accident zone in the Eastern Cape .This is believed to be caused by the higher number of motor vehicles coming from the western cape.MEC Tikana says their education campaign will focus on pedestrians and taxi drivers.&#8220;One of the things we have identify as a Province is the lack of understanding to motorist, we will focus in the road blocks in all our entrances of the Eastern Cape, and also strengthen our road safety education especially with pedestrians. More number of fatalities that happened last year increased because of them,&#8221; Tikana said.MEC Grant says the joint plan between western cape and Eastern cape is really important.&#8220;MEC Tikana invited me here because of the big traffic flow that will start from Cape town this afternoon so she will be checking on her side and I will be checking on my side.&#8220;It is very important for us to have this join planning as we trying to improve the road safety records, last year in the Western Cape we lost about 258 people from the 1st of December to 31st of January so we want to reduce the number this year.&#8220;One the causes that cause accidents is fatigue of drivers, we encourage drivers to rest after driving a long distance from the Western Cape,&#8221; said Grant.Tikana added that they will be educating people about the importance of behaviour during the festive season.&#8220;We are increasing the number of our cameras on the roads and we are warning our drivers that even if they don&#8217;t see any road blocks, traffic cops will be on cameras strategically placed in our roads.&#8221;The Eastern Cape accidents increased during the last season with more than 250 deaths leaving the province with higher percentage.Meanwhile up to 16 people have been arrested in a festive season roadblock on the N1 highway in the Free State.The MEC for Transport in the Free State Sam Mashinini embarked on a similar campaign for the season.&#8220;The purpose of an operation is to make sure that people are safe in the province and that its impact positively to eliminate accidents on the road.&#8220;Motorist and travellers should appreciate the visibility of the SAPS as well as traffic cops on the roads,&#8221; Mashinini said.TNA Reporter
