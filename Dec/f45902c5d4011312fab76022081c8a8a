Skipper Steve Smith says Australia&#8217;s pace attack will test the resolve of Pakistan batsmen with short-pitched bowling in Brisbane&#8217;s first ever day-night Test from Thursday.Smith has yet to finalise his team and hasn&#8217;t ruled out playing with four pacemen at the expense of spinner Nathan Lyon, but he is promising the tourists a work-out on the bouncy Gabba pitch.With in-form quicks Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood armed with the new ball, Smith said team strategists had watched Pakistan&#8217;s recent series in New Zealand where the tourists slumped to two hefty defeats.&#8220;I think traditionally sub-continent sides don&#8217;t handle the pace and bounce in Australian conditions,&#8221; Smith said Wednesday, ahead of the three-Test series.&#8220;So you need to try and find ways to exploit that as much as possible and at times I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re going to see some short-pitched bowling to mess with their feet to find ways to get them out.&#8220;New Zealand obviously did a good job, so hopefully our bowlers can replicate that.&#8221;Smith was far more upbeat about Australia&#8217;s chances after stopping the rot of five straight Test defeats with a revamped team in Adelaide late last month.&#8220;It&#8217;s been a nice turnaround. We&#8217;ve won four games on the trot (including three ODIs against New Zealand) as an Australian team now and hopefully we can keep that winning momentum going,&#8221; he said.Pakistan also have fast bowling ammunition to return fire at the Gabba, led by Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz. Smith pinpointed Amir as a potential &#8220;handful&#8221;.&#8211;AFP
