After numerous failed attempts since the August local government elections, the beleaguered Nquthu local municipality will be afforded yet another opportunity to elect its office bearers today.Nquthu has on five previous occasions since the 2016 local government elections failed to elect office bearers to perform day-to-day oversight in the administration. We are optimistic that the councillors will this time around put the interests of their residents and service delivery as priority number one. The shenanigans that have led to the collapse of meetings on five occasions is eroding the confidence in the municipality and we need to restore this, MEC for Cogta Nomusa Dube-Ncube said.Last month the municipality and its district were placed under administration when inter- and intra-political party infighting complicated by continuous court interdicts at Nquthu prevented reconstitution of this council, with a knock-on effect on uMzinyathi district.In August Ntshangase obtained a court interdict preventing the municipality from inaugurating councillors after he was reportedly disowned by his party. The intervention in terms of section 139(1)b of the Constitution remains in place to guide the fragile situation in the two municipalities. The administration has ensured uninterrupted service delivery as well as the municipality s swift response to the on-going drought and other natural disasters, Cogta spokesperson Lennox Mabaso said.Nquthu is one of nine hung municipalities where neither the ANC nor the IFP emerged as outright winners following the recent local government elections.NOKUTHULA NTULI
