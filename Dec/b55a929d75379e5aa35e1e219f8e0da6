Philippine Vice-President Leni Robredo said Sunday she was told that President Rodrigo Duterte had barred her from cabinet meetings, and alleged there was a plot to oust her as his deputy.Robredo, who said she would resign from the cabinet, did not say who was behind the alleged plot to remove her as vice-president.But she cited differences with Duterte, such as over the rash of extrajudicial killings during his &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; and the hero&#8217;s burial granted to dictator Ferdinand Marcos.In the Philippines the president and vice-president are elected separately. Duterte and Robredo come from rival parties.&#8220;I had been warned of a plot to steal the Vice-Presidency. I have chosen to ignore this and focus on the job at hand. But the events of recent days indicate that this plot is now being set in motion,&#8221; Robredo said in a statement on her Facebook page.&#8220;I will not allow the Vice-Presidency to be stolen&#8221; despite leaving the cabinet, she said.&#8220;We received a text (SMS) message last Saturday from Cabinet Secretary (Leoncio) Evasco, relaying the President s instruction&#8230; for me to desist from attending all Cabinet meetings starting this Monday, December 5 .&#8220;This is the last straw, because it makes it impossible for me to perform my duties,&#8221; Robredo said.She had been named to the cabinet as a housing official.-AFP
