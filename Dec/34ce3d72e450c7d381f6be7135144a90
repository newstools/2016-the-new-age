The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs in the Eastern Cape says it is worried about the rising number of deaths of initiates in the province.This comes after the number of initiates has risen up to 17 deaths with the Chris Hani district leading with five deaths.The Spokesperson for the department Mamkeli Ngam says that the department is under a dark cloud .&#8221; we are mourning as a province and the majority of the initiates are going home this weekend , those who are remaining behind, we are appealing to parents that they visit their boys everyday&#8221; said NgamIt is reported that Chris Hani District has reported five deaths followed by the Alfred Nzo and OR Tambo districts with four each, with recent deaths in Amathole district two and Nelson Mandela Bay one.Chief Ngangomhlaba Matanzima from the house of traditional leaders says this is a difficult problem that they are facing however the national government is failing them.&#8220;The national government is just talking and we blame national government, because even though they can see there is a problem with traditional initiation, they are not providing any assistance, said Matanzima&#8221;When they required to provide the resources they are failing, children have been dying in South Africa , they should provide money vehicles so that the schools can be monitored at the moment there is nothing form the national government except for talking&#8221; said Matanzima.It is reported that the dehydration and heat conditions are the major cause of deaths of initiates and illegal initiation schools.Ngam also urged residents to help the department in exposing illegal initiation schools.&#8220;Members of the public must assist to make sure that those people who are operating illegal initiation schools must be brought to books, and all initiation forums in the province should give boys water, said Ngam&#8221; One of the reason we have been able to observe is that these boys are dying because of dehydration and those who required medical attention must be referred to the nearest hospital to save their lives, said NgamThe department has ensured that the remaining initiates are well taken off so that no more deaths will be reported from the initiation schools.The department says prior this season they conducted workshop for traditional leaders to help curb such deaths.&#8221; Workshop are meant to equip the knowledge , the skills from the point of view of Traditional leaders, community and the workshop did helped as parents are able to come forward to report those illegal traditional initiates &#8221; said the spokesperson.Both the House of Traditional leaders and Cooperative governance are appealing to the community to work hand in hand with government.&#8220;We are appealing to parents in all forms of media communicating with the entire community of the Eastern Cape that that the correct time to send your boy to the mountain is the month of June because weather conditions are a bit cool especial those who are close to the mountains, said Chief MatanzimaTNA Reporter &nbsp;
