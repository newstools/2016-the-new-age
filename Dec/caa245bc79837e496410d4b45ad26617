This year has been a good one for the Inkatha Freedom Party, not just in terms of what we have accomplished in Parliament, but also as a political party during the local government elections this year.The IFP has effectively taken back Zululand and now has control of 12 municipalities, leading six outright and another six in cooperation with other opposition political parties. In Parliament, in the National Council of Provinces and the parliamentary portfolio committees, the IFP remains a voice of reason and pragmatism, as this country strives to meet the challenges it faces.In an address at the Cape Town Press Club in January, our leader, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, aptly stated: I am not one to oppose for the sake of opposing. In every debate on the state of the nation address for the past five years, I have said that the IFP will support the government where it does the right thing and we will support the President when he does the right thing. But when they don t, we will speak truth to power and loudly oppose it. Unfortunately this has been a non-stop year of speaking truth to power, as South Africa has been rocked by numerous executive and government errors .The chickens have certainly come home to roost and not just at Nkandla, but in many other instances, including the #FeesMustFall protests, the charging and then withdrawal of charges against the finance minister, which resulted in economic loss, the debacle at the SABC, the costly nuclear plan and the list goes on and on. The IFP brought the debate on the #FeesMustFall crisis before the National Assembly on an urgent basis and has been a voice of reason in regard to issues leading up to the crisis and in providing suggestions for its peaceful resolution.In general, the 2016 parliamentary year has been one largely of frustration and distraction as the National Assembly has been seized with one scandal after another. If one then factors in the time that Parliament was shut for the local government elections, there was precious little time available for the actual issues of bona fide governance.The IFP is heavily involved in the crafting of the new rules of Parliament for the National Assembly and joint rules of Parliament, at subcommittee and committee level, as it is clear that in their present form our rules can in no way deal with the new energies in Parliament and the way politics is now practiced in South Africa.We are at a political watershed moment in our fledgling democracy, hence the great need to adapt our rules to such conditions. The IFP ably participated in all debates in Parliament. Nevertheless, we would like to see greater budgetary support from Parliament in respect of research assistance for the smaller political parties. There are several positives that deserve to be mentioned.The government must be commended for its recent forward thinking approach on medicinal cannabis, from making it available to citizens suffering from serious chronic ailments and dread diseases, to allowing cultivation under licence from the department and greater research into the plant s medicinal value and palliative care applications.The Medical Innovation Bill, first introduced by the IFP s Dr Mario Oriani-Ambrosini MP in 2014 and which the IFP continued after his sad death, has in no small way advanced the argument for medicinal cannabis and assisted in making it available to patients as an alternative treatment and palliative care protocol, should they so desire. Looking ahead to next year, we can expect an increase in the rise of political tension at national, provincial and local government levels.This will principally be driven by the internal feuding within the ruling party as it fractures into support for its various candidates for the role of leader of the ANC. The new year will be a year of robust parliamentary debate and engagement.Narend SinghNarend Singh is the parliamentary chief whip of the IFP
