Companies and state-owned enterprises in SA spent R8.6bn on social development in the country in 2015-16 representing a 6% increase in nominal growth from the previous year.This growth is in line with inflation, therefore reflecting zero growth in real terms. This, according to Trialogue s annual research into expenditure approaches to corporate social investment (CSI) in South Africa.Until 2013, Trialogue consistently found that the total annual estimated CSI expenditure was growing in real terms. For the last two years, however, CSI expenditure experienced negative growth in real terms (-2% in 2014 and -6% in 2015) and has now flattened to zero real growth.This, along with other key findings and thought leadership on CSI, is detailed in the widely referenced Trialogue CSI Handbook 2016 a resource intended to enhance the impact of social development initiatives in South Africa to be released today (Tuesday).The top 100 companies invested R5.8bn in CSI which amounts to 68% of the total CSI expenditure. Fifteen companies tracked by Trialogue spent more than R100m in 2015-16, together accounting for more than half of the total amount spent by top 100 companies.The mining, retail and financial services sectors together accounted for three-quarters of total CSI expenditure, with mining alone accounting for more than 30% of total CSI expenditure.Education received nearly half of CSI spend and was the most popular cause, supported by over 90% of companies and receiving almost half of the total CSI spend (48%) up from 32% in 2010.Social and community development and health were the second and third most commonly supported sectors, although support and expenditure for both declined marginally from 2015.Gauteng-based projects are most commonly supported by companies and received the greatest share of CSI expenditure out of the provinces, although the amount declined for a second year in a row to 19% in 2016, from a peak of 27% in 2014.Support for projects in Limpopo increased marginally, while decreases in corporate support were noted for all other provinces.sellor@thenewage.co.za
