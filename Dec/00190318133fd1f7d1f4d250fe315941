The McLaren report reveals the rot in Russian sport but smacks of a political attack because other countries escape similar scrutiny, according to Russian pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva.In an interview with L&#8217;Equipe French sports newspaper on Monday, three days after the McLaren report disclosed an &#8220;institutional conspiracy&#8221; of doping in Russia, the two-times Olympic gold medallist said she welcomed the drive to clean up Russian sport.&#8220;But focusing investigations on one country is a political act,&#8221; said Isinbayeva, banned from the Rio Olympic along with more than 100 other Russian athletes following revelations of state-sponsored doping.&#8220;I do not believe there was a conspiracy, and I just want the McLaren investigation to be extended to the whole world,&#8221; adding that &#8220;the doping in Russia is no different to anywhere else.&#8221;Isinbayeva, appointed head of Russia&#8217;s anti-doping agency last week, said the McLaren report whose final version commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency was published Friday, had failed to deliver proof to back up its findings including the names of violators, the drugs used and other details.&#8220;They talk about proof but we have not seen any,&#8221; said the former three-times world champion.What she said dismayed her most was the condemnation of all athletes rather than the search to identify and punish the cheats.&#8220;I am against the cheats but I don&#8217;t like generalisations. How can I agree there is institutional doping (affecting everybody) when I have never been part of it?&#8221;Isinbayeva is still furious at being barred for the Rio Games as part of a collective sanction taken by the IAAF in response to the first part of the McLaren report published in July which revealed state-sponsored doping.&#8220;Of course I agree that our cheats should be banned. They cheated, let them pay the price. But what upsets me is the collective ban that solves nothing.&#8221;&#8211;AFP
