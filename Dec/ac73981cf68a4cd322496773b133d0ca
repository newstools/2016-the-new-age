The average water level for the province s dams has fallen below 50% and authorities have once again appealed to the public to use water responsibly.MEC of local government, environmental affairs and development planning Anton Bredell says the latest data shows water usage across the province remains high.However, he says, the water situation in the Western Cape is not yet a crisis.This despite five municipalities being declared disaster areas over the past year. There are large numbers of visitors to the Western Cape for the holiday season that adds to the demand for water. We ask the public to assist us in using water responsibly, he said. The Central Karoo remains one of the worst affected areas in the Western Cape. Department officials went to the region last week to provide information and create water savings awareness for the region and to visitors passing through via the N1. This programme will continue in the West Coast early in the new year, Bredell said.He said officials are constantly monitoring the situation and municipalities, implementing additional measures including restrictions and tariff increases where necessary.The five municipalities declared disaster areas are Karoo district, West Coast, Witzenberg, Prince Albert and Oudtshoorn.The extreme drought in the most affected regions, West Coast and Central Karoo, is affecting almost 400 settlements. Meanwhile, the city of Cape Town has received more than 1000 complaints since implementing level three water restrictions.According to city officials, they have witnessed a spike in water consumption in the past week with an average of 905 million litres being used each day.The city has been aiming to maintain a target of 800 million litres of water used a day.-VINCENT CRUYWAGEN
