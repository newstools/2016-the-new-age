Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday joined settlers in welcoming US President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s nomination of a hardline lawyer to be ambassador to the Jewish state.David Friedman, a bankruptcy attorney, supports settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank, characterised by succesive US administrations as an &#8220;obstacle to peace&#8221; with the Palestinians.A source in Netanyahu&#8217;s office said the premier was &#8220;pleased&#8221; with the appointment.&#8220;He knows David Friedman has the full confidence of President-Elect Trump and looks forward to working closely with him,&#8221; the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Earlier, Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely called the appointment &#8220;good news for Israel&#8221;.Friedman &#8212; a Trump campaign adviser &#8212; backs moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, contrary to Washington&#8217;s longstanding policy of basing its ambassador in Tel Aviv.&#8220;His positions reflect the will to strengthen the status of Israel&#8217;s capital, Jerusalem, at this time and an understanding that the settlements have never been the real problem in the region,&#8221; Hotovely wrote.In a Trump transition team statement on Thursday announcing his appointment, Friedman said he wanted to work for peace and looked forward to &#8220;doing this from the US embassy in Israel&#8217;s eternal capital, Jerusalem&#8221;.The United States and most UN member states do not recognise Jerusalem as Israel&#8217;s capital, and the city&#8217;s status is one of the thorniest issues of the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Israel captured Arab east Jerusalem in the Six-Day War of 1967 and subsequently annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community.The Palestinians claim it as the capital of a future state.The Yesha council, which represents the more than 400,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank, praised the new ambassador-designate.&#8220;Friedman has a deep love for all of the land and people of Israel, including those in Judaea and Samaria,&#8221; the group&#8217;s foreign affairs envoy Oded Revivi said in a statement on Friday, using the biblical term by which the Israeli right describes the West Bank.&#8220;His knowledge and wisdom of the issues will strengthen the bridge between our great nations.&#8221;The left-wing Israeli daily Haaretz was less welcoming.&#8220;By Israeli standards, Donald Trump&#8217;s designated Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, is an extreme right-winger,&#8221; it commented.&#8220;He makes Benjamin Netanyahu seem like a left-wing defeatist.&#8221;Netanyahu&#8217;s coalition government is seen as the most right-wing in Israel&#8217;s history.The Palestinian government has so far not formally responded, though Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was due to address journalists later Friday.-AFP
