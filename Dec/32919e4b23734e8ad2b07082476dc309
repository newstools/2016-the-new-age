SOUTH Africa s youngest DJ, four year-old DJ Arch Junior will attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the third time after two failed attempts. The young DJ could not get recognition from Guinness even though he set the record by playing for an hour and five minutes at a McDonald s outlet in Pretoria.DJ AJ s father, Glen Hlongwane, said although Guinness was impressed by his son s deejaying skills they had to reject it because he was expected to break the world record at a certified club. This is the challenge we are facing, finding a club. We are working towards hiring a club and inviting people to come and enjoy AJ s set. When we succeed in booking a club we plan to have an alcohol-free event and also other DJs in the line-up, that is what Guinness requires, he said.Hlongwane said there would be no shortcuts when it came to the third attempt, the club had to be an established one. He said that the attempt was solely to inspire and make South Africans proud of the talent it possessed. I believe this will be great for the nation to have the youngest club DJ in the world coming from the country. We seek to inspire other aspiring DJs, young or old, to push for their talents to be recognised in the global sphere. DJ AJ s first world record attempt flopped as he could not reach the one hour mark set for him.provinces@thenewage.co.za-Nontokozo Gxumisa
