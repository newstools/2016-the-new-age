One lucky musician will drive away in a brand new car should they get enough public votes in the Come Duze SABC Song of the Year competition to be announced in Richards Bay on New Year s Eve.The competition, which is in its second year, will run through the public broadcaster s radio stations wherelisteners will vote for their favourite song, from the current playlist, through an SMS line. We are growing the campaign and we are going to make it even better this year. The total package is R500000 going to one artist and the artist also gets a car worth in the region of R250000, R150000 cash prize and R100000 for booking in Richards Bay and Johannesburg, campaign founder Owen Ndlovu said.Ndlovu said the aim of the competition was to empower South African artists so they did not become victims of poverty like some of the country s late legends. We believe that with this type of money the artist will be able to at least buy a house because you can get a house for R300000 and they still have the car, so those are the most important parts in a human life, especially as an artist because they ve got to get around going to the studio among other places. They also work nights until the early hours of the morning and they need a roof over their heads, he said.This year the top 10 artists, depending on the public votes received, would also take home R30000 each. We ask people to vote for their favourite songs because a lucky listener will also drive away in a brand new car, so we are not only empowering the artists but members of the public who reach into their pockets to support local artists, Ndlovu said.uMhlathuze municipality mayor Mdu Mhlongo expressed his delight that this year s event would be hosted in his city, saying the spin-offs for the local tourism industry were huge. This is a big event with both a national and international footprint and it positions our municipality well for our own tourism strategy, he said.The Song of the Year will be revealed during the Last Dance Music Festival which attracts thousands of patrons from around the country every New Year s Eve.NOKUTHULA NTULInokuthulan@thenewage.co.za
