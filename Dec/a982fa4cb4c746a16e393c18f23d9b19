Hillbrow residents were left in shock after witnessing a 45-year-old woman taking her own life and that of her child by jumping from a block of flats on Sunday.A salon owner said a group of onlookers pleaded with the woman not to jump from the building s fifth floor. She first pushed the child and we all heard the child screaming. The woman then attempted to jump from the balcony twice, before eventually doing it, We were all shouting please do not do it, don t do it . She was crying at the time. I was unable to even eat because of it, he said.The drama unfolded on Sunday evening at an apartment block situated in Claim and Leyds streets in Hillbrow. While the police are still investigating the matter, speculation is rife that domestic abuse was the main cause of the tragedy.Cassey Chambers from the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) urged people to pick up on warning signs of suicidal behaviour. Anyone can pick up on the signs. Someone might write a letter, they might start talking about suicide and death and saying I wish I was not here any more , she said.She said that Sadag receives over 400 calls a month from people needing help. The organisation advised family and friends of someone they suspect may be suicidal to listen to the person without judging them. Talking can sometimes help the person gain perspective on their problem and realise that there is always a solution and help available.It is also advisable to seek professional help from a psychologist or a psychiatrist, she said. Cassey said there were various triggers for suicide. It s a combination of factors, ranging from undiagnosed depression, bipolar disorder, poverty, a loved one s death, it s never one thing. If someone has been going through a hard time, it becomes difficult for them to think clearly, she said.zodidim@thenewage.co.za
