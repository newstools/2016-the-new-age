The studio behind &#8220;Despicable Me&#8221; and &#8220;Minions&#8221; puts out another potential blockbuster hit in animated movie &#8220;Sing,&#8221; which is all about a singing competition that could make or break the careers of its contestants, as well as the theater it&#8217;s hosted in.&#8211; Who&#8217;s in it and what&#8217;s it about? &#8211;Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey), the koala in charge of a grand theater in need of steady income, decides that everybody needs a singing competition to revive their spirits &#8212; and the theater&#8217;s piggy bank.As it turns out, the prospect of a $100,000 prize does have its appeal, among five in particular: Rosita the pig, Mike the mouse, Ash the porcupine, Johnny the gorilla and Meena the elephant.Among them, Rosita (Reese Witherspoon) had musical chops well before her overwhelming family of 25 piglets and exhausted husband came along, while Johnny (Taron Egerton) is from a crime family but wants nothing more than to croon for a living.Scarlett Johansson plays Ash, Tori Kelly plays Meena, and Seth MacFarlane plays Mike.&#8211; Who&#8217;s behind it? &#8211;Garth Jennings, whose background is in music videos, made his feature film debut with &#8220;The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy&#8221; in 2005, following up with &#8220;Son of Rambow&#8221; in 2007. Since then he&#8217;s directed music videos for Vampire Weekend, Radiohead, and Atoms for Peace.Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande contributed their original song &#8220;Faith,&#8221; while the story&#8217;s talent contest theme allows for plentiful cover versions of other songs.Production company Illumination Entertainment is best known for &#8220;Minions,&#8221; &#8220;The Secret Life of Pets,&#8221; and the &#8220;Despicable Me&#8221; films.&#8211; Is it any good? &#8211;Early reaction to &#8220;Sing&#8221; has been good, with a 78% approval rating on a 6.7/10 average review score from Rotten Tomatoes, a 70/100 score from Metacritic, and a 7.3/10 from 1,700 user reviews on IMDb.It&#8217;s also in the running for two Golden Globes &#8212; Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song &#8212; as well as the Annie Awards&#8217; accolade for musical achievement.&#8211; When&#8217;s it out? &#8211;Premiering at the Toronto film festival in September, &#8220;Sing&#8221; has already gone on general release in several territories including Germany, Singapore, Taiwan and the Netherlands.December 21 brings with it wide release in the USA and Canada, and the following week it arrives in numerous territories including Brazil, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Spain, and Vietnam.Audiences in the Philippines (January 8,) France (January 10,) and the UK and Ireland (January 27) need to wait a little longer &#8212; at least then they&#8217;ll know how many Golden Globes the film picked up.&#8211; Trailers &amp; Social &#8211;Official trailer: youtu.be/guztEQ7DkaE, facebook.com/SingMovie/videos/1418695374812583/ Facebook page: facebook.com/SingMovie Instagram account: instagram.com/singmovie Twitter feed: twitter.com/singmovie Official website: singmovie.com-Relaxnews
