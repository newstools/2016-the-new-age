WITH increased traffic flow expected in the province from weekend, police, roads and transport MEC Sam Mashinini said there will be more roadblocks to ensure there were no road fatalities.Mashinini was speaking yesterday in Parys during the launch of the provincial road safety campaign.He said there would be no mercy for drivers caught without a valid drivers licence, driving under the influence of alcohol and those who are negligent. We are expecting an increase in the traffic flow across the province because there are vehicles driving through our beautiful province to other destinations. Among the national roads in the province are N3 and N1, more roadblocks will be held at the national roads and the local roads at different times and but I will not reveal those time and places, Mashinini said, adding there would be more traffic law enforcers deployed on all provincial roads.The MEC said more than 10 illegal immigrants had been arrested during the launch, which included the roadblock. The main purpose is to ensure that when people enter the province they are safe. We want law-abiding drivers, we are talking to them, we are appealing to them to abide the rules of the road, and we will also deal with those who do not have the necessary permits and drivers licences, they will be arrested, Mashinini said.He said their mission was to have a peaceful festive season and said they could not have people breaking the law on the roads. Drinking and driving will never ever be tolerated and texting and driving as well as chatting on the phone while driving will not be tolerated either. We will deal with the culprits, Mashinini said.He said since the beginning of the festive season the traffic flow had been increasing from weekend to weekend. Last Friday, Mashinini launched the second phase of Back to Basics in Bloemfontein where operations in towns across the province were launched.-BECKER SEMELA
