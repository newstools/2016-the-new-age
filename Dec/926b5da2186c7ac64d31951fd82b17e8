RESEARCHERS have hailed the 5 400 South Africans taking part in the historic HIV vaccine efficacy trial launched in Soshanguve, Pretoria ahead of World AIDS Day on Wednesday.The historic trial kicked off at 15 sites across the country starting in Verulam, KZN where the first participants got their first injection yesterday. We are still seeing about 1 000 new infections every day, but we now begin a scientific exploration that could hold great promise for our country. If an HIV vaccine is found to work in SA, it could dramatically alter the course of the epidemic, Prof Glenda Gray, HVTN 702 protocol chair and chief executive of the Medical Research Council, said.HVTN 702 is the only HIV vaccine efficacy trial in the world and is being conducted solely in South Africa.The study will test a modified form of the vaccine regimen used in RV144, a trial conducted in Thailand, which reported in 2009 that the candidate vaccine was 31.2% effective in preventing new HIV infections. The vaccine would obviously add to a number of preventative tools, such as condoms and medical male circumcision but having the vaccine would have more impact because vaccines do not depend on an individual s adherence, director of the HIV prevention research unit of the MRC Prof Gita Ramjee said.Half of the HIV-negative and sexually active volunteers enrolled for the programme will be given a placebo and the rest will receive the vaccine. The vaccine is safe but some participants might have minor side effects such as nausea and skin rash but we will be monitoring them every month for the first three months and then every quarter for about 36 months. We will also be in constant communication telephonically, Dr Anamika Premrajh principal investigator, said.The first participants to receive the vaccine yesterday, Ningi Mbutho, 29, and Siyazi Mncube, 23, said they were excited to be part of the ground-breaking research. Being part of the study was not a difficult decision to make because it felt right to me to do something like this. My hope is that the end will bring us a step closer to getting rid of HIV, Mbutho, a mother of four, said. If we can prevent then we wouldn t have to treat because at the moment we still have people defaulting on their treatment, Mncube said. The results are expected in 2020.-LERATO DIALE AND NOKUTHULA NTULI
