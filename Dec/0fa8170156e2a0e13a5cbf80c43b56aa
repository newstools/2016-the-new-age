Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has launched a staunch defence of his preferred possession-based style of play, saying the team&#8217;s poor form will not force him to change his idea of the best style of football.City made a flying start under Guardiola, winning their first 10 games, but have won just four times in 15 matches since, a run which has left them fourth in the Premier League, seven points behind leaders Chelsea.&#8220;No way. We are going to play the way I feel. I believe in the way I like to play, I am sorry,&#8221; Guardiola told reporters on Tuesday when asked if he was contemplating a change of style ahead of Wednesday&#8217;s game with Watford.&#8220;If I cannot do that, the chairman will decide. But there&#8217;s no way I will change. Of course I have to adapt, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I change the way I believe. You have to play in this kind of way. It&#8217;s the best way.&#8220;I thought maybe it would be shorter to adapt but I am pretty sure it will happen. If people want me to fail, there&#8217;s nothing I can say. Here you have to control the second ball. Without that, you cannot survive. We were able to do it earlier in the season.&#8221;City were thrashed 4-2 by champions Leicester City on Saturday, and against Watford will bid to avoid losing back-to-back league games for the first time this season.-Reuters
