South Africa s ARV treatment programme, touted as the best in the world, continues to boost the country s life expectancy rates.Deputy director-general for HIVAids, TB and maternal, child and women s health in the national Department of Health Yogan Pillay said: The ARV programme has made a significant impact on life expectancy. According to the South African Medical Research Council, an increase of 5.8 years was recorded in a period of three years. In 2009 life expectancy was 57.1 years rising to 62.9 years in 2014, the SAMRC said.Health Department media liaison officer Popo Maja said: The ARV treatment has made a huge difference in terms of life expectancy and in the next ten years the expectancy will increase positively. Chief actuary of Sanlam Employee Benefits Viresh Maharaj said life expectancy in South Africa is impressive, but it would be much higher if it were not for the effect of HIV-Aids. Life expectancy in the country is less than it should be due to the impact of HIV-Aids, but that is improving because of the ARV treatment programme the country has, Maharaj said. Maharaj said recent evidence indicates that ARV treatments may be able to lengthen an HIV-positive individual s life to up to 86% . This will affect SA s demographic progression into the future and increase the proportion of older people in our country. StatsSA has estimated the overall HIV prevalence rate is about 12.7% of the total South African population. The total number of people living with HIV is estimated at about 7.03 million in 2016. For adults aged 15-49 years, an estimated 18.9% of the population is HIV positive, StatsSA said.The number of Aids-related deaths has declined consistently since 2006 from 325 241 to 150 759 Aids related deaths in 2016.Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time an organism is expected to live, based on the year of birth, their age and other demographic factors including sex.Aging World 2015 said: Global life expectancy at birth reached 68.6 years in 2015. A female born today is expected to live up to 70.7 years on average and a male 66.6 years. The global life expectancy at birth is projected to increase almost eight years, reaching 76.2 years in 2050. North America has the highest life expectancy at 79.9 years and is projected to continue to lead the world with an average regional life expectancy of 84.1 years in 2050, while life expectancy for Africa is only 59.2 years.However, Africa is expected to undergo major improvements in health and Aids-related mortality in the next few decades and its life expectancy in 2050 is projected to be 71 years, narrowing the gap between North America and Africa.The total fertility rate has also declined between 2005 and 2016 by 0.27%, while life expectancy at birth in the present year is estimated at 59.7 years for males and 65.1 years for females. The crude death rate is down from 12.9 deaths per 1000 people in 2002 to 9.7 deaths per 1000 people in 2016. Life expectancy at birth had declined between 2002 and 2005 but the expansion of health programmes to prevent mother to child transmission as well as access to antiretroviral treatment, has partly led to the increase in life expectancy since 2005, StatsSA said.Life expectancy is continuing to increase and this may be related to marginal gains in survival rates among infants and children underfive following the HIV interventions in 2005.news@thenewage.co.za
