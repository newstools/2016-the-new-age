Japan is postponing a summit with China and South Korea, the government said Tuesday, after the impeachment of South Korean President President Park Geun-Hye.The Asian powers were planning to hold an annual trilateral gathering this month in Japan, which is the rotating chair.South Korea&#8217;s parliament voted Friday to impeach Park, who is engulfed in a scandal over her friendship with a long-time confidante who has been charged with meddling in state affairs.Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, while not directly mentioning Park&#8217;s impeachment, said &#8220;various factors&#8221; were behind the decision.&#8220;We decided to re-arrange it and hold the summit at an appropriate time next year,&#8221; he told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting.Park has been relieved of official duties as president and is awaiting a decision by the country&#8217;s Constitutional Court &#8212; a process that could take months &#8212; on whether she will have to permanently step down.She has been replaced in the interim by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-Ahn.Leaders of the three countries met in November last year in South Korea for the first time since 2012.Summits had been on ice due largely to Tokyo&#8217;s often thorny relations with Beijing and Seoul over territorial issues and history.-AFP
