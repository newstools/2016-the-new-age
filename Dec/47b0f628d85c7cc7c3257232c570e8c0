The 2016 festive season has just begun and people have already started counting down the days to Christmas, but it seems retailers and businesses won t be able to count on their Christmas profits this year.For the last few years, South African consumers have been feeling the pinch. Figures show an increase in credit defaults on new accounts and an increase in distressed borrowing levels. Not only is this bad news for credit providers, but it also indicates that consumers are finding it difficult to meet even their regular expenses meaning they have less spending money come silly season.The latest data published by the SA Reserve Bank (SARB), as well as the RMB/BER Consumer Confidence Index (CCI), indicates suppressed economic activity, on the basis of reduced consumer and business spending and borrowing.SARB s data shows that rates of credit extension to both households and businesses slowed in October 2016, painting a bleak picture for both retailers and credit providers: they both seem unlikely to get a share of employees Christmas bonuses this year. Private sector credit extension rose by 6.3% in October versus 7.2% in September, while the rate of credit extension to households has steadily decelerated over the course of the year, from 4.5% in 2015 to 1.2% this year.Some industry experts calculated that in terms of the reduced consumer spending and borrowing, both demand and supply factors have accounted for the slowdown.Clothing retailers such as Mr Price, Foschini and Woolworths suffered a major blows in profits this year, a testimony to the official data. The RMB/BER CCI for the fourth quarter, published on Wednesday, showed that confidence dropped by four index points to 38, following an improvement in the third quarter which left many optimistic.The survey revealed that this means a larger majority of the 1 600 respondents, surveyed between October 17 and November 21, are more unsatisfied with business conditions now than during the third quarter. Simply put, without a notable improvement in sentiment, the economy will remain stuck in first gear, Ettienne le Roux, chief economist of RMB, said.Laura Campbell, senior economist at Econometrix, said it appears that in this economic climate, households are reluctant to take on additional debt in order to fund unnecessary purchases. In the current economic environment, the financial position of households has come under pressure in recent months in a lagged response to the 1.25% cumulative rise in interest rates between July 2015 and March 2016, which includes higher inflation. In terms of the private sector, the decline in year-on-year growth extension is not surprising in line with the fact that economic growth remains weak, she said.Some quarters have said that consumer spending activities in general are not significant enough to stimulate the economy in any meaningful way, and that last week s Black Friday will not massively boost the economy, since it was a once-off event.Some analysts argued that the decline in the private sector credit could be attributed to the fact that, for a worrying number of businesses, business rescue has been a name of the game since the beginning of this year due to a tough economic environment and rising costs, severely impacting on credit providers profits.Bernard Sathekge|bernards@thenewage.co.za
