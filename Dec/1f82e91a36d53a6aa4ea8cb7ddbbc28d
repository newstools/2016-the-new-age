LAWYERS for Human Rights (LHR) will have to pay legal costs for both its lawyers and government lawyers, for two occasions that it went to court to challenge Operation Fiela and lost.Yesterday, the Constitutional Court described the LHR s actions as not just imprudent, but also improper. Although the issues the LHR raised before the high court may in other circumstances have protected them if they lost the litigation, bringing them six weeks after the operation and giving the government respondents barely a day in which to respond was not just imprudent, it was not proper, the court said.Operation Fiela was carried out over months through a string of raids that resulted in about 9000 people arrested, the majority of them being undocumented foreigners.Six weeks after the operations were halted, LHR lodged an urgent application in the high court, saying the way in which the raids were carried was a violation of human rights. The court ruled that the application was not urgent and ordered that the organisation pay costs for both its lawyers and the government s counsel.The organisation tried to appeal the cost order in the same court and lost. It went on to the Supreme Court of Appeals and lost again. In the ConCourt, the organisation argued that it should not be forced to pay costs because it sought to vindicate constitutional rights against state parties.It argued that by lodging the application, it intended to stop possible future conduct and therefore it was appropriate for it to seek urgent relief. However, the unanimous judgment by the ConCourt yesterday lambasted the LHR, saying despite its best efforts, it had advanced no acceptable basis on which the court may conclude that the high court exercised its discretion unjudicially. Nor is the costs order here likely to have a chilling effect on future litigation. The high court s ire about the urgency and the extreme exaction LHR laid upon the respondents cannot by any stretch be regarded as unwarranted, they said.-DUDU DUBE
