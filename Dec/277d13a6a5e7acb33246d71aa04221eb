Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane on Friday told a crowd in Khayelitsha, Cape Town that while the latest crime stats show a decline in sexual offences, South Africa still has high incidences of abuse which must be countered.&#8220;Gender violence is a serious human rights violation and is a big problem in our country,&#8221; said Mkhwebane.Mkhwebane was addressing residents of Khayelitsha commemorating 16 Days of Activism against abuse of women and children.According to Mkhwebane, statistics paint a scary picture when it comes to the safety of women and children where most of them suffer abuse at the hands of people they know and in their own homes.&#8220;Police recorded 51 000 instances of sexual offenses between March 2015 and April 2016. These statistics paint a scary picture when it comes to the safety of women and children and about 7 130 of the cases were reported in the Western Cape,&#8221; said MkhwebaneMkhwebane told the crowd that although a citizen cannot report an incident of rape directly to the public protector, her office was equally committed to ensuring the safety of women and children.&#8220;A victim of rape cannot report the crime to us. That should be reported to the police. When you do not get the help you need from the police, you may escalate to the IPID, you may also report abuse to the Office of the Family Advocate. Only when you are still not satisfied may you come to the Public Protector,&#8221; said MkhwebaneMkhwebane&#8217;s deputy Kevin Malunga added that South Africans should be active participants in the fight against gender violence saying &#8220;The solution lies with us.&#8221;&#8220;President Zuma says 16 days of activism is not enough and this should be a year long campaign and we agree. My plea is for communities to work with us to ensure that government does its work,&#8221; said Malunga.The Public Protector also took the opportunity to assure citizens she intends to bring the services of her office closer to communities.&#8220;I just came out of a strategic planning session with my management and we resolved to invest more time and resources in taking our services to the grassroots,&#8221; said Mkhwebane.-TNA Reporter
