&nbsp;The high court has declared a section of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa (the BCCSA) code of conduct unconstitutional.This finding is the result of legal action taken by Redisa (Recycling and Economic Development Initiative of South Africa), which laid a complaint against broadcaster M-Net claiming the broadcast failed grossly and across a range of issues, to meet the required standards of accuracy and fairness .Before agreeing to consider the complaint, the BCCSA required that Redisa waive any other rights or claims it had against such broadcaster. Had Redisa acquiesced, this would have meant the company would have no further recourse against the broadcaster once the complaint had been heard by the BCCSA.The implication of this is that should Redisa have wished to have taken the broadcaster to task on any other basis in the court of law, for example defamation, that would not have been possible.Furthermore, the chairperson of the BCCSA refused to allow the complaint to proceed until Redisa had waived such rights. Redisa took the matter to the high court where it was not challenged by all four respondents, namely the BCCSA, the chairperson of the BCCSA, Carte Blanche and Joy Summers (producer of the Carte Blanche segment in question).The judgment found the demand made by the BCCSA was not only unconstitutional, but also irrational and invalid. The judge called for the BCCSA to amend its constitution and remove reference to the civil rights waiver.Richard Marcus of Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr said: The implications of this judgment for individuals or SMMEs who elect to take to task irresponsible broadcasters who misrepresent, defame and in many cases ruin reputations, is significant.Individuals and companies may now lodge complaints with the BCCSA without fear that they will be called upon to abandon other rights which they may have, which in the past would have discouraged complaints to the BCCSA. The striking of this rule will also mean that broadcasters will not be protected by imposing this choice of rights on complainants. Broadcasters will be held accountable to the code of conduct regardless of whether or not they may be at risk (for other legal reasons) for other claims by complainants. In the past, wronged parties who may not have had the legal representation or understanding, would have been forced into giving up their civil rights before their case had even been heard. The outcome of this case ensures that individuals and entrepreneurs will experience greater protection that the rule of law should offer to all South Africans, Marcus said.TNA REPORTER
