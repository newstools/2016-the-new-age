The Western Cape department of health said it is aware that patients in need of chronic medication have to stand in long queues at the Gugulethu Community Health Centre where they collect their supplies.Patients have made clear their frustrations at having to wait for hours on end for their medication and to be seen by a doctor.Long queues seem to be an issue for many members of the community with both members of the KTC informal settlement and Gugulethu using the health facility. The patients also complain about poor service delivery as some are told to return the next day because the dispensary was closed.Most patients said they have to take time off work or set aside the whole day when they need to collect their medication or see a doctor.Provincial health spokesperson Monique Johnstone said the department was aware that there are long queues in the morning at the health centre.But Johnstone said although the queues are long, clients are assisted speedily and there are also chronic clubs, which chronic patients attend weekly to alleviate waiting times, including one off-site chronic medicine dispensing unit where patients can collect their medication closer to home. There are weekly chronic clubs for chronic patients with medication collection dates to alleviate waiting times, including one off site chronic dispensing unit where clients can collect their medication closer to home, Johnstone said.She also raised concerns about patients failing to adhere to their appointment dates which leads to longer waiting times. One of the major factors that contribute towards long queues at the facility is the non-compliance with appointment dates given at our chronic clubs. People who do not stick to their appointment dates and times will have to unfortunately comply and follow the process and system of making an appointment, waiting for a folder and queuing to be examined by a clinician and then waiting for medication. Hence we continue to communicate to chronic clients that it is essential that they adhere to their appointments to avoid long waiting times. Johnstone said there are also administrative factors which add to the problem. The problems that we are experiencing at the moment is at the facility s reception area due to infrastructure and folder management challenges, but these issues are being addressed and the facility management team are discussing ways to improve the challenges. The facility has sufficient reception and admin staff on duty but undue pressures are felt if unforeseen incidents occur. Patients are urged to honour the doctor s appointment date as indicated on the appointment card and must not send a collector or family member to collect the parcel on the last medication appointment date as the patient is required to be examined by a doctor.Keitumetsi Motlhaleprovinces@thenewage.co.za
