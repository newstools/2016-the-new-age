In addition to the crippling drought, ageing water infrastructure in Mopani district has also been cited as a contributory factor to water shortages in the area over the past few years.This was disclosed by the provincial water board, Lepelle Northern Water, during a media briefing at Ranch Hotel outside Polokwane recently.CEO Phineas Legodi said it had been found that the little infrastructure it has, especially the Giyani water scheme, was more than 30 years old and has long outlived its lifespan. When water was pumped from the old scheme, it used to spill all over the area it was meant to feed. Our quick response has turned that situation around, Legodi said.Lepelle Northern Water board chairperson Midiavhathu Tshivase said about 55 villages would benefit from the Giyani water and reticulation scheme. Instead of faulting the past regime, the management of Lepelle Northern Water led by our CEO Legodi embarked on confronting the water and sanitation backlog which left the communities of Mopani district vulnerable for 40 years. We remain confident that 55 villages will benefit from a water reticulation plant which will address water and sanitation problems that have been troubling the villages here, Tshivase said.The Giyani project is expected to cost about R77m. The water-distressed Mopani district started to develop hopes of having reliable supply about three years ago.That after President Jacob Zuma declared the Muyexe area in Giyani a nodal point that deserved more care from the government.Zuma has since launched a multibillion-rand water plant that has in the past two years spent about R2.8m.Though most of the targeted villages don t have a reliable water supply yet, the national Department of Water and Sanitation said with funds permitting, most of the set goals would ultimately be realised.MONTSHO MATLALA
