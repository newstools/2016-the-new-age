The two men seeking bail for forcing Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa into a coffin have on Friday told the Middelburg Magistrates Court that they wanted to arrest Victor because he allegedly stole copper cables.On day two of the bail hearing John Welch, who is the defence attorney for both Theo Martins Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen, began proceedings by putting it to Investigating Officer Dimakatso Bahula that the men had intended to arrest Mlotswa for theft.According to Welch, the co-accused did not arrest Mlotshwa because he then made threats against the safety of the two men&#8217;s wives and children and also said he would burn their crops every year.
