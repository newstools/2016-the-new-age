The announcement that South Africa will begin implementing the HIV Test and Treat policy, the kick-off of the biggest HIV vaccine efficacy trial ever conducted on African soil and hosting the International Aids Conference in Durban for the second time on the continent were just some of the highlights of the health calendar this year.The road however has been bumpy as the deaths of 37 psychiatric patients hogged headlines attracting the attention of the UN and South Africans alike while bad working conditions, of nurses and doctors, lack of security at healthcare facilities across the country and long working hours also made the headlines.The country continued to trail-blaze on health matters while civil society organisations and ordinary South Africans continued to hold office bearers feet to the fire .We take a look at the year that was, the good the bad and the ugly. HIV Test and Treat PolicyDuring his budget vote speech this year Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi hailed the progress made in the fight against HIV-Aids but warned about an ever exploding burden of non-communicable diseases and high levels of injuries and trauma owed to the high rate of accidents on the country s roads.He bemoaned the price of essential drugsm urging civil society to continue its fight for cheap and accessible medicines for all.Motsoaledi also announced the country would begin implementing the World Health Organisation s recommendations on the Test and Treat policy which will see everyone who tests positive being put on ARV treatment immediately regardless of their CD4 count. The Life Esidimeni tragedyThe country voiced its outrage and outright shock after Gauteng health MEC Qedani Mahlangu revealed in the legislature that 36 psychiatric patients who were moved from Life Healthcare Esidimeni facilities following the termination of a long running contract had died. It would later be revealed that the 39 patients had died. Unconfirmed reports say the number could be as high as 60.Following the revelation, Motsoaledi ordered health ombudsman Prof Malegapuru Makgoba to investigate.The families of those who died say they await the release of the report with bated breath.Gauteng Premier David Makhura promised to take action should it be found that government officials have acted negligently or improperly.The UN expressed shock at the deaths calling on SA to set up a policy framework to guide its de-institutionalisation process, including a plan of action with time lines and benchmarks. Historic HIV vaccine efficacy trial kicks offThe biggest HIV vaccine trial ever to be conducted on African soil kicked off on the eve of the World Aids Day.Led by the country s foremost experts in the field, including president of the South African Medical Research Council, Prof Glenda Gray, the HVTN 702 trial has the potential to make history.More than 5000 South Africans are taking part in the trial. Civil society organisations activism and the fallen soldierTreatment Action Campaign finally won the bitter battle to have Free State health MEC Benny Malakoane removed from office in October.Tobeka Daki, an activist living with HER2 positive breast cancer, succumbed to the illness this year. Daki was at the forefront of the fight against pharmaceutical giants exorbitant prices of medicines.Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said one of its highlights this year was the growth of the Fix The Patents Law Campaign from 18 groups to 31 groups representing a full range of diseases and patients groups in SA. The 21st International Aids ConferenceSA hosted the second International Aids Conference on the continent since the death of Nkosi Johnson, child activist who addressed the 13th Aids Conference in 2000. The unsung heroesThe working conditions of healthcare workers continued to make headlines this year after a Limpopo nurse was attacked and killed by a psychiatric patient in the ward she was working in.A Cape Town junior doctor at Paarl hospital was killed in a crash believed to have been caused by fatigue after she worked long hours, prompting the South African Medical Association to introduce colour armbands aimed at showing how long a doctor has been on duty for.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
