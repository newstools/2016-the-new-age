 We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10. Bill GatesWe often talk about the ways that the computing revolution impacts the lives of individuals, businesses and societies. Many, if not most, of these impacts are positive.That is why we launched an online learner application (OLA) website for Grade 1 and 8s for the 2017 academic year.It is a pity that one glaring ill has been the reluctance, resistance and delay some parents and guardians are towards change.To date 51% of parents representing 60000 pupils still have to confirm their offers of placement. This delay is clogging up the system, making it difficult for the department to place all pupils that have applied for schools.Of course the Gauteng department of education (GDE) has come under heavy criticism for offering the online registration system. There are those who are concerned that it forces schools to change their language policy usurping the power of governing bodies.They argue that the online system forcibly allocates parents and kids to nearby schools in which the teaching language may be different to their child s home language.There are those who argue that the online-only system discriminates against lower-income earners who cannot afford the internet. Is the resistance and delay due to fear of the unknown, fear of erosion of power and influence, difficulty in breaking old habits, or is it due to prior negative experiences with change and therefore legitimate concerns about the proposed changes?Parents need to understand that those who have adopted the digital tools of modern life see many of the benefits that have occurred over the past decade.Unfortunately those who delay to confirm offers of placement risk losing the offers to other parents who are on the waiting list.There is no doubt that because of technology the world is vastly smaller.Whether in facilitating job opportunities or enabling extended family connectedness through social networks, telecommunications has empowered healthy commercial and social relationships that otherwise couldn t be maintained across physical distances.Because of technology, gatekeepers are bypassed. Many industries have been and are being transformed by disruptive innovation.Think also of the financial, travel, music and retail businesses.Through technology, finding everything is easier. Search engines such as Google and Bing make it easy for anyone to find out anything that s public at any given time.Alas, mobility puts computers constantly in our hands. Access to computers was once limited by cost and then by physical form factors such as the personal computer on a desktop. Now, the awesome communications and computing capabilities of a smartphone are constantly at our sides.Let us share the benefits of technology with those who stand to gain most, the pupils and parents.Over the next 15 years, progress in science, technology and innovation will be key to delivering on all socio-economic development goals, from poverty eradication to agriculture and food security, to energy, to water and sanitation, and climate change and education.Lest we forget that technological innovation is embedded in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, together with advancing science and technology, as Goal 17.I agree that science, technology and innovation cannot be confined to the use of new technologies or software, but rather, innovation is a mind-set and an attitude.It means questioning assumptions, rethinking established systems and procedures, and introducing new strategies.New technologies are important, but as a means to an end.That is why I agree with Gates when he said the lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history.He said important breakthroughs will be driven by innovation and technology, ranging from new vaccines with universal coverage, better agricultural yields due to better seeds, better nutrition, cheaper smartphones and new ways to deliver these benefits to more people.He is right.Poverty has been halved because of innovation. Countries are following others that have done it right.Economic miracles start with, among others, agriculture and education.Cheap smartphones are a game-changer. In the next 15 years mobile phone coverage will go up, the price will come down, gender equity will improve and online software will be flourishing, Gates predicted.This will revolutionise everything agriculture, access to digital payments, low transaction costs, women s empowerment and education.I am glad that most parents have been mostly pleased with the new online registration process.Fewer forms and minimal wait times have translated into happier parents registering their children for school. The new method is easier and faster, several parents in the district said.In a country dominated by technology, the push toward online registration is an obvious goal. The system is ideal for schools looking to save the time, money and aggregation typically associated with traditional, paper-based student registrations.The online solution enables schools to streamline the registration process by instantly removing the manual, tedious, and repetitive work associated with traditional registration practices.Unfortunately the online registration system is closed. Parents who still have to confirm offers of placement should do so as a matter of urgency, failing which they will lose those offers.The department is now finalising the enrolment processes and the districts will continue to assist parents with placements where space may still be available and this might not be close to where their parents work or live.Priority is however given to those who applied on time.Let it be known that our mission at the GDE is to allow schools to spend more time educating and less time and budget on paperwork.Panyaza LesufiPanyaza Lesufi is Gauteng MEC for education
