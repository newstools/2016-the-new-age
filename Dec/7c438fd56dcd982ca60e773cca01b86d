KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Maj Gen Bheki Langa has welcomed the stiff sentences handed to rapists over the past week in courts throughout the province.Langa said the hefty sentences handed down to convicted rapists during the 16 Days of Activism for no violence against women and children would act as a deterrent and were a positive sign that police work was yielding results.At least five men between the ages of 32 and 34 were sentenced to two life terms and 61 years imprisonment by the KwaDukuza, Eshowe and Madadeni regional courts. These sentences will send a strong message as we are celebrating the 16 Days of Activism for no violence against women and children, that we will make sure that the rapists are locked behind bars for a long time, Langa said.Between Monday and Friday the Madadeni Regional Court alone sentenced three convicted rapists, Siphamandla Makhaza to life imprisonment for rape and 15 years imprisonment for robbery, Thobani Mabaso to life imprisonment for rape and Phumlani Wiseman Sibisi to 13 years imprisonment for rape and kidnapping.Makhaza broken into the home of his 29-year-old victim at the Emaskopasini area, Osizweni. Finding her asleep he attacked the victim and raped her.Mabaso who was sentenced on Wednesday was found guilty of raping a 20-year-old woman in January 28, 2013. The victim had been on her way home at the time she was accosted by Mabaso about 7pm. Sibisi was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for the rape of a 17-year-old school girl who he had offered a lift to on June 4.Langa said the convictions and sentences were proof that police were working hard to rid the province of those who pose a danger to society. We will not rest until we find those responsible for breaking the law in our province. I also plea with the community to refrain from hitch hiking or accepting lifts from people they do not know, he said.Meanwhile on Monday the KwaDukuza Regional Court convicted and sentenced Nkosinathi Trueman Msomi to 13 years imprisonment for the rape of a pensioner.The 65 year old was asleep at her homestead at Ezibandleni area, Glendale, when she was attacked by Msomi on Christmas Eve in 2015.Also on Monday Lungisani Mthembu was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by the Eshowe Regional Court for raping a 14-year-old child on May 20, at Vonono area, Nyoni.SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULO&nbsp;
