President Vladimir Putin in an interview aired Sunday called US President-elect Donald Trump intelligent and predicted he would quickly grasp his new level of responsibility and act accordingly.&#8220;Since he managed to achieve success in business, that shows he is a clever person,&#8221; the Russian strongman said in an interview with NTV television that has already aired in the country&#8217;s far east, quoted by TASS news agency.&#8220;If he&#8217;s clever, that means he will fully and quite quickly grasp a different level of responsibility.&#8221;Putin said that Russia &#8220;expects that he will act precisely on this basis.&#8221;The Kremlin said last month that the two men agreed, in their first phone call after Trump&#8217;s election win in November, on the need to &#8220;normalise&#8221; Russia-US relations.Putin on Thursday reiterated Moscow&#8217;s readiness to work with Trump&#8217;s administration once the president-elect takes office in January.&#8220;It is important to normalise and start to develop bilateral relations on an equal and mutually-beneficial basis,&#8221; Putin said in his annual state of the nation address.Trump has praised Putin&#8217;s leadership and said he looks forward to &#8220;a strong and enduring relationship with Russia.&#8221;During the US election campaign, Putin praised him for appealing effectively to disenchanted American electors.&#8220;He represents the views of a significant part of society in the United States that is tired of those elites who have been in power for decades,&#8221; he said in October.&#8220;He just represents the interests of such ordinary people, and he presents himself as an ordinary guy who criticises those who have already been in power for decades.&#8221;-AFP
