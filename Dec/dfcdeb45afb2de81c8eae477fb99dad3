Amid the failure by residents of Ekurhuleni to cut down their water usage by 15%, as per restrictions imposed by the national government, the metro announced yesterday that a relaxation of water restrictions in the city was unlikely in the near future.The metro said water savings are monitored on a weekly basis and since the implementation of the restrictions, it has yet to reach the targeted 15%. At a meeting on December 7 with the department of water and sanitation, Rand Water and municipalities, Ekurhuleni recorded 8% savings, with neighbouring metropolitan municipalities Joburg at 10.5% and Tshwane at 19.5% for the week, Ekurhuleni metropolitan spokesperson Themba Gadebe said.Ekurhuleni has implemented water rationing from 9pm-5am in the evenings according to the city s website.Gadebe said that engagements with the business sector in the city had been fruitful, with local businesses responding positively to the call for saving water. An appeal goes out to all residents to heed the call and pledge with the city to save water, he said.In the first week of this month, the Vaal Dam s water level was 37% of its total capacity, which was due to augmentation from Katse as well as head waters from Sterkfontein, which will be stopped on December 22.Gadebe said that the restrictions would only be reviewed in May 2017.He warned that should the restrictions not be adhered to, a fine of R6 753.64 will be imposed on households per incident. For businesses, this fine is set at R13 762.24. By standing together we can ensure that we save this life-giving resource, because if we don t there will be no water, said Gadebe.Any incidents can be reported to the city via email. If possible, people are urged to include a photograph, stipulate the address and GPS coordinates if available, time and details to savewater@ekurhuleni.gov.za.Residents are requested to ensure that they to fix all water leaks on their properties and report those outside of properties to the city.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
