A burkini and a Brexit campaign leaflet feature among the items added to a collection at London&#8217;s Victoria and Albert Museum, reflecting the burning issues of 2016.The V&amp;A has included the dark-blue, full-body swimsuit in a collection exploring the relationship between current global events and art and design, the world-famous museum said Friday.It was acquired from Australia-based fashion designer Aheda Zanetti, who invented the garment in 2004 to enable Muslim women to participate more fully in sport.The burkini made headlines in August when it was banned in around 30 French towns, including Riviera beaches, sparking heated public debate about the rights of women. The ban was later overturned by France&#8217;s highest administrative court, the Council of State.A &#8220;Vote Leave&#8221; campaign leaflet distributed ahead of Britain&#8217;s June 23 EU referendum also joins the museum&#8217;s collection, along with a flag designed for the first refugee team competing in the Olympics.&#8220;These objects have become newsworthy because they advance what design can do, or because they reveal truths about how we live today and how we might live tomorrow,&#8221; said V&amp;A curator Corinna Gardner.Yara Said, a Syrian refugee who designed the orange flag for the refugee team competing in the 2016 Rio Games, was inspired by the life jackets worn by people fleeing conflict around the world, including herself.&#8220;For me, the life jackets are a symbol of solidarity for all those who crossed the sea in search of a new country. I myself wore one, which is why I so identify with these colours,&#8221; she said.The refugee team was barred from flying the flag in official processions but spectators and athletes displayed it as a show of solidarity during the Games. -AFP
