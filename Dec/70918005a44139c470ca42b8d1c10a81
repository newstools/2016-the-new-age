Power utility Eskom on Monday reiterated it would continue to ensure it procures coal used in its power stations from companies that are at least 50% black owned.The announcement by Eskom follows reports that Exxaro s black shareholding could be reduced to 30%.Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said Eskom will soon ask for a meeting with Exxaro in an effort to understand how they plan to comply with the 50%-plus policy requirements .According to a statement published by Eskom the utility partnered with the Departments of Mineral Resources and Public Enterprises in December 2012 in the development of the Black Emerging Miner (BEM) Strategy.&#8221; This strategy has been largely successful, with coal from BEMs increasing from R1.7 billion (6%) in 2012 to R6.9 billion (18%) in 2015 and is projected to rise to R14 billion in 2020. &#8221; reads Eskom&#8217;s statement.Interim Group Chief Executive Matshela Koko said What is actually happening is that the ongoing legacy of the pre-1994 economy is being confronted by the Eskom leadership. This is the legacy that we have not worked hard enough to dismantle, and at times have been frightened to confront. Eskom has resolved to do something radically different. Eskom also stated in ensuring that they comply with their BEE procurement the security of coal supply to Eskom power stations cannot be compromised.&#8221; The coal qualities must remain within specifications and the cost must be within the range prescribed by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa).&#8221; said Eskoms statement.Meanwhile Resources has sought to assure its investors thats its new shareholding agreement would not affect its supply arrangement with Eskom.&#8221; Remaining empowered is an essential part of Exxaro s strategy to not only maintain sustainable relationships with critical stakeholders and ensure ongoing compliance with specific customer requirements, but also to further the imperative for transformation in South Africa. Accordingly, Exxaro wishes to pursue and implement the Replacement BEE Transaction.&#8221; the miner said in a statement recently.-TNA Reporter
