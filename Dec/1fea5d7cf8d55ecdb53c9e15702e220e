A 24-YEAR-OLD man from Meloding near Virginia has died in hospital after he was allegedly beaten by two prison warders at the Virginia Correctional Centre.Police spokesperson Capt Malebo Khosana said they were called to the centre just after midnight on Thursday. On arrival, they found prison warders and a man inside a Quantum bus near the centre s gate. At this point, it is not known who called police to the scene.According to the officers on the scene, the man s body looked severely injured. An ambulance was called to the scene and the victim was taken to the local hospital. He died at the hospital while medical practitioners were working on him, said Khosana.It was reported that the beating occurred when the two warders were on a routine patrol near the single quarters.The quarters are situated away from the main correctional centre, and have been broken into on previous occasions.While on patrol, the two warders saw the man, who was allegedly in the process of breaking into one of the houses of the single quarters. It is reported that he was standing near the window of a house. The two warders tried to catch him and he ran away, Khosana said. They apparently fired warning shots to stop him, and he did so. They caught him and took him to one of the halls in the vicinity where it looks like he was beaten up. Khosana said the Quantum bus was used to take the suspect to the gate where he was handed over to the ambulance.It appears that the prison warders intention was to arrest the suspect for attempted house breaking, although why they used violence is unclear.At the crime scene, police investigators found four empty cartridges near the hall where the suspect was held.Khosana reported that a case of murder was opened for further investigation by Virginia police and a post-mortem would be conducted in order to determine the cause of death.The fate of the two warders involved, who are aged 27 and 29, will be known as the investigation continues.The deceased was a parolee who was under supervision for a previous housebreaking case in Virginia.-KAMOGELO SEEKOEI
