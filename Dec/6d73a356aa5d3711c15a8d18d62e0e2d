Everton manager Ronald Koeman has asked his players to keep their emotions under control ahead of Monday&#8217;s Premier League derby against Liverpool.Everton have not won in the last 11 top-flight matches against their Merseyside neighbours, losing 4-0 in April in a match in which defender Ramiro Funes Mori was sent off for a reckless tackle on Liverpool forward Divock Origi.&#8220;The derby is all about the fans, we understand that but we need to be calm and prepare for the game in the way we like,&#8221; Koeman told a news conference on Friday ahead of his first Merseyside derby.&#8220;It&#8217;s about preparing the team. You have an emotional part that you need to control. That&#8217;s the most important.&#8221;Everton have only one win in their past 19 league games against Liverpool going back to 2007.&#8220;It&#8217;s not good. One out of 19,&#8221; Koeman said. &#8220;We need to accept how difficult it is, win the game and make the fans happy.&#8221;Everton, who beat Arsenal 2-1 in midweek, are eighth in the league while Liverpool are second, but Koeman has taken heart from the neighbouring team&#8217;s recent struggles.Liverpool beat Middlesbrough 3-0 on Wednesday, but were held 2-2 by West Ham United at Anfield and lost 4-3 at Bournemouth this month.&#8220;They are strong, doing well, but lost their way against Bournemouth and drew with West Ham. If Bournemouth can beat Liverpool, we have a possibility,&#8221; Koeman said.Victory over Arsenal snapped a run of five games without a win for Everton.&#8220;The positive side is that we keep our belief until the end of the (Arsenal) game,&#8221; he added. &#8220;That is part of the character of the players.&#8220;We had a good support from the fans and it makes it difficult for teams to play at Goodison Park.&#8221;Everton trio Gareth Barry, Leighton Baines and Ryan Mason signed new contracts on Friday, but Koeman confirmed Yannick Bolasie&#8217;s season was over after the forward underwent knee surgery on Friday.&#8220;Bolasie had surgery on his meniscus but now needs another on his anterior cruciate ligament,&#8221; the manager added. &#8220;He will be out for a long time.&#8221;-Reuters
