Rick Perry, the former governor of oil-rich Texas who once vowed to eradicate the Energy Department if elected president, is Donald Trump&#8217;s pick for energy secretary, US media reported.The Texas native, who participated in the Republican primary but was crushed by President-elect Trump early on, was seen Monday afternoon entering and exiting Trump Tower in Manhattan.Perry once assailed Trump as a &#8220;cancer on conservatism&#8221; and threw his support behind Texas Senator Ted Cruz after dropping out of the race in September 2015, but he has long been rumored to be one of Trump&#8217;s main contenders for the energy post.NBC and CBS news both reported late Monday that Trump had chosen Perry for the job, citing two sources familiar with the transition process.The 66-year-old former governor, who also ran for the Republican party&#8217;s 2012 nomination, famously fumbled a debate when he vowed to abolish three US departments &#8212; but could only remember the names of two.&#8220;The third agency of government I would do away with &#8212; the education, the commerce. And let&#8217;s see. I can&#8217;t. The third one I can&#8217;t. Sorry. Ooops,&#8221; he told a tittering crowd in 2011, only to remember later in the debate that it was the Energy Department.The longest-serving governor in Texas history, Perry was the first casualty in a crowded battle for the Republican Party nomination in 2016.-AFP
