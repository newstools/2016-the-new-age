Kuwait&#8217;s new oil minister said Thursday he expects crude prices to climb to $60 a barrel as output cuts agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC producers take hold next year.Essam al-Marzouk gave no timeframe for his projection, saying only that he was optimistic producers would comply with the agreed cuts and end a longstanding supply glut.&#8221;We expect oil prices to range between $50 and $60 a barrel when the agreed cuts start&#8221; in January, Marzouk told reporters.&#8220;We expect the price to climb to $60 later and hope it will stabilise there. This is a good price for us and will preserve production quotas for OPEC and non-OPEC members.&#8221;OPEC announced at the end of last month that its members would slash output by 1.2 million barrels per day beginning in January, to 32.5 million bpd.Last week, non-OPEC members approved cuts totalling 558,000 bpd.Marzouk said statements so far about complying with the agreed cuts were &#8220;very encouraging.&#8221;He said OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo will visit Kuwait next month for discussions on a mechanism to monitor production.Kuwait was appointed head of an OPEC committee charged with monitoring compliance by the cartel&#8217;s 13 members.&#8221;In January, it will be more clear who will comply and we hope that all states will comply,&#8221; Marzouk said.The minister said Kuwait had started preparatory work for the resumption of production from two oilfields in the neutral zone shared with neighbouring Saudi Arabia.The two fields, with a total production of 500,000 bpd, have been shut down for almost two years.&#8221;We are awaiting a decision by the political leadership to resume production &#8230; We expect to start soon,&#8221; Marzouk said.He said Kuwait would reduce production from other fields to compensate for any additional output from the neutral zone.-AFP
