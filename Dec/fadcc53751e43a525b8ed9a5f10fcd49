Struggling Swansea City slumped to a third consecutive loss as West Ham United put further distance between themselves and the Premier League relegation zone with a comfortable 4-1 victory at the Liberty Stadium on Monday.Home keeper Lukasz Fabianski&#8217;s mistake allowed former Swansea player Andre Ayew to put West Ham ahead after 13 minutes and the nearest Swansea came to equalising before the break was Gylfi Sigurdsson&#8217;s free kick that was saved by Darren Randolph.West Ham doubled their advantage in the 50th minute when defender Winston Reid met Dimitri Payet&#8217;s corner with a header that gave Fabianski no chance.Second-bottom Swansea had plenty of possession but West Ham were defensively solid and Michail Antonio put the result beyond doubt when he turned in Havard Nordtveit&#8217;s shot.Fernando Llorente grabbed a late consolation for the hosts but there was still time for Andy Carroll to embellish a third consecutive win for the Hammers.-Reuters
