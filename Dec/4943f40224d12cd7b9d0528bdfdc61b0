Life is like a chain, we have to engage others and continue smoothly with it, he said.The 31 year old said he started singing at the tender age of 10 and has never put down the microphone since then.He has participated in many local talent shows and was introduced to a bigger stage in 2001 when he performed at one of the most popular music events on the South African calendar the Mangaung Cultural Festival (Macufe) held in the province annually.Serame said he has performed as the opening act for renowned artist Ringo Madlingozi and the legendary AfroFusion group Stimela. I auditioned for SA idols in 2010 and managed to be one of the top 57 contestants, I also auditioned for South African pop stars in the same year and I managed to be one of the top 30 contestants, Serame said.He said he was the only artist in the top 30 from the province, although he did not win the music show, he continued to soldier on. In 2011, I was also the only contestant out of 33 South African Idols contestants who shared the stage with rock band The Parlotones and the following year, I was the in-house musician for some of Sun International hotels, he said.Also one of the 20 contestants on Thembi Seete s choir on clash of the choirs (TVshow) South Africa in 2013, Serame also had the honour of being the opening singer for award-winning acapella group The Soil and award winning rapper Khuli Chana.

Late in 2013 I was asked to be part of the SA Idols special choir that was backing top 7 contestants in the competition and I was also on South African X Factor and the only contestant from our province, said Serame who still continues singing at the special events.Workshops conducted by the best in the country s music industry including the likes of RJ Benjamin, Thabo Mdluli, Zwai Bala, PJ Powers and others have helped shape Serame s career.
