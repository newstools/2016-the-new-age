Rikhotso.According to the HAWKS interviews are currently being under-way with the men found on the premises.&#8221; When we received the information it was alleged that this brothel was being run by a Nigerian so we are conducting interviews particularly with the Nigerian man to ascertain whether he runs the brothel.&#8221; said Capt.
