The walk out staged by the SABC was a total disrespect to Parliament and this constitution, ad hoc committee chairperson Vincent Smith said on Monday.Last week Wednesday SABC chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe alongside SABC execs staged a walkout after his urgent request for reports of the Auditor-General, Public Protector and Independent Communications Authority of South Africa be translated to braille, was declined.The chairperson of the committee tasked with looking into the SABC board&#8217;s fitness to hold office said it was incumbent for the committee to make it clear to the board that walking out shows disrespect for Parliament. It shows a lack of co-operation by board, it also showed total disrespect for parliament and constitution,&#8221; Smith added.However the SABC&#8217;s chairperson said the walk out was because his constitutional rights were being violated and that the committee denied him access to cross examine the witnesses.The committee said it did not have a problem with the SABC exercising their rights or the rights of its chairperson.African National Congress(ANC) member in the committee Makhosi Khoza urged members of the committee to be firm on the matter, adding that the parliamentary committee must not be bullied by the SABC and that it must not be dictated to on how they must conduct the affairs of the inquiry. I don&#8217;t think this level of impunity should be tolerated. The SABC have forfeited their right to cross examine witnesses. They have contravened the Constitution, Khoza said.She further reminded members that all organs of the state have a duty to account to Parliament. She added that a strong message needs to be sent to the SABC.The inquiry is expected to call MultiChoice as part of the team that must give testimony on the SABC board&#8217;s fitness to hold office.Among other witnesses who are expected to give evidence in the committee on Monday includes its former general manager Labour Relations Madiwe Nkosi, Jabulani Mabaso former Group Executive of Human Resource, Sipho Masinga former Group Executive Technology and fired SABC 8 Thandeka Gqubule, Krivani Pillay, Vuyo Mvoko and Lukanyo Calata.-Sipho Jack
