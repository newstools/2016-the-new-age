It was the second time the hearing was postponed, the first time was due to Mashaba s non-availability and a request for more time to prepare for his case.Mashaba is in the firing line for misconduct and by many accounts within Safa, he is on his way out. The DC involving Bafana Bafana coach has been postponed to next week.The coach requested more time to prepare his case, Safa communications head Dominic Chimhavi said.
