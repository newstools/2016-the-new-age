The family of Everite Chauke, three, will today put their little girl to rest, following weeks of trauma and uncertainity.The funeral takes place at the Green House camp site provided by the Gift of the Givers charity after their home and other shacks were swept away when the Juskei river in Alexandra burst its banks during recent floods.Local community leader Kgabo Rapala, said that the parents, Shadrak and Cynthia, were still trying to come to terms with her death and had thanked all those who assisted to search for their daughter. The family said that they would bury their daughter here, not in Zimbabwe, he said.Everite was swept away from her father s arms after he climbed up a tree with her to seek refuge from the floods on November 15. The branch they were holding onto broke and she fell into the water.Her body was recovered three weeks later but was in such a state of decomposition that the family could not identify her until DNA tests confirmed it was her last Friday.We have been with the family and the confirmation of the DNA test were not a shock. There was no other girl which was reported missing in the area, Rapala said.Councillor Adolph Marema said that the MMC for community development, Nonhlanhla Sifumba, committed the city to help with the funeral which will be held at the Marlboro Cemetery.KUTULLO MADISHA
