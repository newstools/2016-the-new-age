Gambian President Yahya Jammeh will effectively become a &#8220;rebel leader&#8221; if he fails to leave office at the end of his mandate in January, the government-in-waiting said Sunday.Halifa Sallah, a spokesman for the opposition coalition that spurred president-elect Adama Barrow to victory over Jammeh in a December 1 poll, said the longtime leader risked transforming himself into a rebel leader if he tried to stay on beyond his mandate.&#8220;Any president who loses constitutional legitimacy becomes a rebel,&#8221; Sallah said.&#8220;Anybody who is a military officer or civil servant who refuses to be under another constitutional authority obviously would also become a rebel,&#8221; he added.The Gambia&#8217;s top brass have flip-flopped over whether they will remain loyal to Jammeh, drawing warnings from the international community.On Saturday the regional ECOWAS bloc said west African leaders would attend Barrow&#8217;s inauguration and would &#8220;take all necessary actions to enforce the results&#8221;.Sallah spoke after reading an address to the nation on Barrow&#8217;s behalf that made clear the president-elect intended to take power in January once Jammeh&#8217;s five-year mandate expired.&#8220;The constitution orders that I assume office on the day the term of office of outgoing President Jammeh expires. He assumed office on 19th January 2012. His term expires in January 2017,&#8221; Barrow said in the statement.&#8220;On the day his term expires my term as the lawful President of The Gambia begins,&#8221; he added.-AFP
