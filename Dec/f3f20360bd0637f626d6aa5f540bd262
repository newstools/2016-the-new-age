The Cassper Nyovest Challenge has taken twitter by storm after the musician posted a picture of himself standing legs apart on his two Bentleys&#8217;. Nyovest took a photo standing on his two Bentleys and posted it on social media with a caption that expressed his gratitude and his hope to be an inspiration to all those who come from the same place he does. Bought myself an early birthday present earlier this month. My second Bentley this year. God has been so good to me. I was able to find my purpose at an early age and my purpose is to inspire those who come from the same place as me. Where a story like mine is a phenomenon. I grew up looking up to thugs and I was almost caught up in the hype but I then decided to make something positive of myself and share it with the public step by step cause people don t know how much work goes into making a success of yourself without any start up capital as an entrepreneur. I m only 26 but I ve learnt so much. The most important lesson I ve learned so far is to remain humble, especially in the eyes of God. I have learnt not the material stuff go to your head to a point where value People according to what they have. I have learnt to love my family more than I love money, Nyovest said in the picture caption.&#8220;This sh*t look like I got twins now&#8221; pic.twitter.com/H7WMuqsxQO (@BridgeBossTLee) December 18, 2016@PearlThusi pic.twitter.com/ImGgpmA77z #djzinhlecolours (@DJZinhle) December 17, 2016Shoutout to Cass @CassperNyovest pic.twitter.com/YASgmXGu1d HUSTLER (@MojalefaNtopo) December 19, 2016Just when I thought I had seen it all.
