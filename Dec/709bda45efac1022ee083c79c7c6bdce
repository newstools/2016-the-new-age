The closing performance of The Manhattan Brothers Tribute Show brought the house down at the Soweto Theatre in Jabulani at the weekend.From the opening night on December 8, Idols 2015 runner up Mmatema Moremi and her four brothers , a local a cappella group, did justice to the original group in their tribute.Moremi portrayed Miriam Makeba while Mluleki Chuma, Bubele Mgele and the Motha brothers Bonginkosi and Happy were in their element, churning out hit after hit for a solid hour to an appreciative audience to play The Manhattan Brothers.The Manhattan Brothers Tribute Show was choreographed by the flamboyant Somizi Mhlongo.On December 16, the group brought some Christmas cheer to patients across the road at Bheki Mlangeni Hospital.Bonginkosi Motha said a chance meeting in 2009 with the only surviving member of The Manhattan Brothers, Sanza Luwathe, inspired them to pay tribute to the group. He invited us to his home where he showed us pictures of The Manhattan Brothers in the 1940s and 1950s, Motha said to applause. He played us their original music and we were just blown away. That s why we decided to honour them. The Manhattan Brothers endeared themselves to American jazz lovers with a US Billboard hit Lovely Lies.They were also trendsetters who paved the way for legendary performers Hugh Masekela and Makeba.Johan Mthethwa on keys, Thembinkosi Mathebula on double bass and Thekiso Tabane on drums complete the line-up of this diverse group of performers.KUTULLO MADISHA
