Independent Communications Authority of South Africa(ICASA) has on Wednesday laid criminal charges against the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).ICASA laid criminal charges after the corporation failed to comply with the Gauteng high court&#8217;s decision to reverse its editorial policy on not broadcasting footage of violent protests.The ruling required the broadcaster s board chairperson to confirm in writing within seven days from the date on which the order is served that the resolution as endorsed by council of the authority was taken as ordered. ICASA spokesperson Paseka Maleka said the order stated clearly that the SABC needed to cancel a resolution which was published in May this year. The SABC had failed to write to ICASA chairperson to inform him that they have effected the order. The withdrawal was to be done respectively from day when the resolution was taken, Maleka said.He further said the corporation will not lose its licence because that was the last resort when dealing with such matters.However, SABC&#8217;s spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said the corporation has communicated with the regulatory board. If ICASA is taking the SABC to court let them do it, then we will respond to that. We will not do that in the public space, Kganyago said.Earlier this year the SABC&#8217;s Group of Corporate Affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng had vowed to take ICASA to the highest court if he needed to. Motsoeneng was defending the corporation&#8217;s editorial policy on what they called the promotion of irresponsible journalism.In May the SABC made decision that it will not show footage of people burning public institutions like schools in any of its news bulletins with immediate effect, we are not going to provide publicity to such actions that are destructive and aggressive. -Sipho Jack
