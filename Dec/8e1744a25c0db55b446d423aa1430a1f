For a country that is currently hosting one of football&#8217;s most prestigious tournaments in the form of the FIFA Club World Cup, Japan does not look interested.Not many things in the country suggests that the tournament, featuring teams such as european giants Real Madrid that has Cristiano Ronaldo in its rank, as well as African Champions Mamelodi Sundowns, is well underway.Close to the Suita Stadium, the only thing that shows the tournament is underway is limited advertisement on the tiny ticketing centre.Even the advertisement of the Brutal Fruit sponsored Netball tournament would make FIFA and Japan hang their heads in shame.Still, on the eve of the day where &#8216;their&#8217; club will be locking horns with Sundowns at the Suita Stadium in Osaka, the Japanese do not seem bothered much, as majority continue to pace up and down looking for the next train at the subway, while some are getting on with their daily chores.One would think the beautiful architecture that gives a beautiful advert of what Osaka is, or the busy harbours that display hard work from a distance, would be a window of how the Japanese are backing their team, eight time J1 League winners Kashima Antlers.In truth, the people calling the Land of the Rising Sun their home do not even seem bothered, as they count Baseball and Rugby among the sport that excite them.Football is not something that interest them, clearly.This is despite their country having created brilliant players such as Shinji Kagawa of Borussia Dortmund, Keisuke Honda of AC Milan, Hidetoshi Nakamura, formerly with Celtic in Scotland, or Premier League winning striker Shinji Okazaki of Leicester City.It is only when they start speaking of Real Madrid that their faces light up.But how do they make of Kashima&#8217;s upcoming game against Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns tomorrow? Surely, they must be expecting a big result.First, our tour guide, known only as Gatholo, is not even aware of Kashima and believes Sundowns will walk all over them.&#8220;I am expecting a heavy score. Kashima are not that good.&#8221;The man with a beaming smile can be excused for maybe being too friendly to his &#8216;bosses&#8217; for the week.His prediction could probably be because he feels he owes a certain level of loyalty to the people that will be paying his salary this week.The trend continues at Suita, where the match will take place.A Japanese woman, well in her late 20s, is also not convinced that Kashima can hold their own against Sundowns.&#8220;It will be easy game for the Africans. They are more powerful and physically stronger. I may be Japanese but the Africans will win.&#8221;Can Sundowns afford to develop a sense of complacency because their opponents are not even managing to earn the trust and backing of their own people?The Brazilians skipper Hlompho Kekana does not seem to believe so.All the midfielder wants to do is to play a good game and contribute to Pitso Mosimane&#8217;s side going to the next level of a competition that has never seen a South African team feature.On a historic day, Kekana wants to see Sundowns enter and then thrill the big stage with a bang.&#8220;As players, we are excited to be in this kind of event. We are just happy to be here. We cannot wait for the tournament to begin,&#8221; Kekana said.&#8220;As a team, we are aware of what they can do. We watched them against Auckland City.We cannot wait to play them on the field,&#8221; the tough tackling Sundowns captain added.While the game starts at 7,30pm in Japan, South Africans will get to watch it at 12:30 in the afternoon, as the Japanese are seven hours ahead of South Africans.The winner of the match will go to the semifinal to face South American champions Athletico Nacional.mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
