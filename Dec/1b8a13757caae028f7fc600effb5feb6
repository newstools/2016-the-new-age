The year ends in a couple of days time and we all wonder what the new year holds in store for us. We wonder whether good tidings in the sporting arena will come our way to brighten our murky sporting days next year, what with the Springboks having been a bit of a let-down, playing far below what they are capable of.We all must think the Proteas showed themselves to be world beaters, right up there with the best in the world as they chalked victory after victory, often in spectacular fashion, brightening the grey and dull skies of our sport and bringing smiles to millions of South African faces, ending the year gloriously.The country remains ambivalent as far as Bafana Bafana are concerned and their lukewarm performances would not be worrying if there had been not so much financial resources expended and poured down the bottomless pit with no perceived returns accruing to so many generous benefactors who have made a huge financial sacrifice to support the national pride.Could it be that coach Shakes Mashaba is the problem, a stumbling block? The question must remain a moot point to be answered in the fullness of time. But we know the ship is slowly sinking and as we wonder for answers, one cannot be sure if its has not in fact hit an iceberg. If that is indeed the case and the captain is not even aware the ship is slowly taking in water, what is to be done?On another matter, moving away from the football tragedy that is forming, is SA making discernible progress in its bid to host the Commonwealth Games scheduled for 2022? Early in the year, we understood the Commonwealth Games Federation president Louise Martin was wringing her hands in frustration, uncertain if the country s prospects of hosting the games were real or not.Has the country met the deadline of November 30, nearly three weeks ago?Despite assurances given by Sport Minister Fikile Mbalula that guarantees had been sought and signed by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, as we end the year, where are we with the process, given that the deadline was three weeks ago?We live in hope the New Year will yield good fruits for SA and the problems as they relate to coach Mashaba and his association will find a resolution and the Commonwealth Games will become a reality and not a dream.-JO-MANGALISO MDHLELA
