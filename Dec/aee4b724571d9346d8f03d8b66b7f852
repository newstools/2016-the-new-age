With their minds on making their debut at the Club World Cup in nine days, Mamelodi Sundowns will have to honour their Absa Premiership fixture against Free State Stars tomorrow.Pitso Mosimane s Brazilians, who were brought down to earth by Ajax Cape Town in the Absa Premiership on Wednesday, will host Ea Lla Koto at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium.Prior to their clash with the Urban Warriors, Sundowns were on a promising four-match winning streak but that came tumbling down when Stanley Menzo orchestrated Sundowns demise.Sundowns still remain eighth on the log with 13 points, while their next opponents Stars are second from bottom with eight points from 11 matches.Mosimane is struggling to get his players fully focused on their last PSL matches before embarking on what will be a historic trip to Japan to become the first South African team to participate at the Club World Cup. It s unbelievable what s happening in the team (in terms of excitement about Japan). That s why I told the boys you ve got to win the Champions League and then you ll understand where we are and what you ve achieved, Mosimane said. Some of the teams who have qualified for the Champions League next year were revealed, and the boys were saying oh Al Ahly is still there, Zamalek is not there, Zesco United is not there and all that. What is that talk? I though they d talk about the game tonight (against Ajax). It s unbelievable. They are all, four out of five players lining up to win African Player of the Year (based in Africa), four of them were just on PSL player of the year, goalkeeper of the year, Thabo (Nthethe) defender of the year, (Hlompho) Kekana was on the midfielder of the year, Khama (Billiat). I mean, they are in another space. Mosimane is expected to rest some of his key players with the Japan trip in mind.Sundowns squad for the Club World CupGoalkeepers: Kennedy Mweene, Denis Onyango, Wayne SandilandsDefenders: Thabo Nthethe, Tebogo Langerman, Asavela Mbekile, Wayne Arendse, Thapelo Morena, Mzikayise Mashaba, Ricardo Nascimento, Siyanda Zwane, Bangaly SoumahoroMidfielders: Keagan Dolly, Hlompho Kekana, Teko Modise, Tiyani Mabunda, Lucky Mohomi, Themba Zwane, Anthony LafforStrikers: Sibusiso Vilakazi, Percy Tau, Leonardo Castro, Khama Billiat MMASEKEPE MATSEBANEmmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
