The Department of Home Affairs has announced that South African passports for minors will include parents details in 2017.Director General of Home Affairs Mkuseli Apleni has done away with the unabridged version of the country&#8217;s birth certificates, only birth certificates detailing both parents will be issued.As of February, the minor passport will be the main document for their travelling.Departmental spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete said this passport gives the traveller more convenience in that it includes all the birth certificates details into the passport.Tshwete added that the current passports that citizens have can still be used to leave the country.&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to cause a stampede where we make people think that the passports they have will not be able to be used to leave the country or come back into the country.&#8220;Those passports will still work in conjunction with the birth certificate,&#8221; said Tshwete. Tshwete reiterated that this is only done by South Africans. Apleni and the Director General for Department of Tourism Victor Tharage met to discuss the latest concessions on immigration regulations. Furthermore they met with key tourism and immigration stakeholders to engage on the recommendations.Previously, it was expected that parents travelling with a child must produce an unabridged birth certificate of the child reflecting the particulars of the parents of the child.Provision was also made for one parent travelling with a child and where one parent or both parents are deceased or the child is travelling with a relative or another person.Certified copies of unabridged birth certificates and parental consent where applicable were acceptable when travelling with children.The Immigration Amendment Acts of 2007 and 2011 regulation applies to minor children under the age of 18 years.Min Gigaba will on Thursday, 08 December 2016, announce the Department&#8217;s plans for the 2016 #festiveSeason.
