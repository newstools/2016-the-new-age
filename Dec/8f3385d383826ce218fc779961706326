COMEDIAN Trevor Noah made South Africa proud when he comfortably hosted outgoing US President Barack Obama for what the world has described as Noah s biggest night since taking over the hosting duties at The Daily Show in September last year.The comedian walked fine a line between serious and comical and touched on issues of racism, the Obamacare legacy, Russian involvement in hacking and incoming president elect Donald Trump. The interview held at the White House kicked off with a discussion about the recent accusations of Russian interference in the election, which the president accurately observed had been a part of the national debate for at least a month before the final votes were cast.Noah went for the big one when he pushed Obama on Trump s contention that he doesn t require intelligence briefings. I think the president-elect may say one thing and do another once he s here. It doesn t matter how smart you are, without intelligence briefings you are flying blind. On the issue of racism, which Obama and Noah share similarities on, the president was far more relaxed and even laughed once or twice as he shared his own experiences on how to best handle delicate race-related issues during his two terms in office. When you are a person of influence and have a platform, it is sometimes difficult to navigate the space between speaking your mind and sharing your true opinion on race while at the same time not seen to alienate some of the people you are talking to. How did you navigate that through your two terms? Noah said. There have been times in my public life where I have said, how do I say this diplomatically and in the way that is received, Obama said.-SIYABONGA SITHOLE
