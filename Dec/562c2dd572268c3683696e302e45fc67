It is also fitting that we undertake this reflection in this beautiful city of Durban, since it was here in 2002 when we launched our Union and the governments and peoples of the continent, committed to build an Africa that is prosperous, integrated and peaceful, driven by its own citizens and playing a dynamic role in the global arena.The launch of our Union came at a point when a large part of the mandate of the Organisation of African Unity (the OAU) of decolonization and liberation was completed, with the liberation of Namibia and South Africa in the early 1990s.The commitment to create a prosperous Africa is at the centre of our continental framework to move from the Africa we have to the Africa We Want by the year 2063 through Agenda 2063. It is a solemn pledge to place the African people, especially children, youth, women, and the elderly at the centre of all our endeavours.We will use this programme and spare no efforts to move Africa from being declared a hopeless continent as it was in 2000. We will use all our energies to ensure the narrative of being called the development challenge of the 21st Century , is transformed into the Africa rising narrative since there is no question that Africa has risen out of the ashes of the two dead decades for development of the late 1970 s to the 90 s.During this period, whilst other developing regions especially Asia &#8211; made significant strides in terms of their economic transformation, industrialization, infrastructure and human development. Africa stagnated, remaining under development and marginalized, despite the riches Africa had to offer.Africa is rich because Africa has a relatively young and fast urbanizing population with an abundance of mineral oils and gas resources with also productive land, diverse eco systems, sunshine and amazing flora and fauna.But the paradox of a rich Africa and poor African persists.This paradox also sees the most developed grow on the back of Africa s resources and talents. Of course there are subjective and objective realities that inform that process but colonialism, the global political economy, structural adjustment programmes and bad governance had major parts to play in bringing this paradox about.Agenda 2063 the Africa We Want seeks to contribute to addressing this paradox.As the African Union, we wholeheartedly agree with the assertion that people are the real wealth of nations . Investment in Africa s people therefore remains at the centre of all we do.Here too, our continent has made progress. Today we have more girls and boys in school, than ever before in our history. The African Union, working with different stakeholders in the sector, continues to advocate for expanding access so that all African boys and girls remain in school, until they complete secondary education. We are also undertaking a focused End Child Marriage Campaign so as ensure that the girl child is not diverted from attending school.As part of Agenda 2063, the African Capacity Building Foundation completed a report on the skills gap in the continent, and it is clear that short of an African skills revolution, we will not be able to decisively tackle underdevelopment and poverty as we set out to do.The modernizing of our economies is therefore directly linked to access to higher education.Our efforts in basic education, technical vocational education and training, in science, engineering and mathematics education are at the foundation of the skills revolution.The sector faces many challenges, not least of all funding and relevance in a growing knowledge based global environment.Over the last four years, a number of initiatives started to address this, including the African Universities Summit in Dakar in March 2015, the decision to form an AU Committee of HoSG on Education in 2016 and exploring the establishment of a Pan African Virtual University to use technology in massification of access to higher education.more than hundred years ago, Pixlie iSaka Seme in his Regeneration of Africa speech recognised the importance of integration to African development and prosperity.More than 50 years ago, this call was repeated by the generations of Haile Selassie, Seko Toure, Abdel Nasser, Julius Nyerere and Kwame Nkrumah, when they called on Africa to unite or perish.Indeed, other regions of the world have seen the need for integration, as a guarantor of their shared prosperity and peace, such as the European Union, and increasingly Mecosur in South America, CARICOM in the Caribean and ASEAN in Asia.As globalization, travel and information communications technology have turned our world into a global village, as economic shocks and booms affect all of us, as diseases such as HIV, Ebola, Zika and Sars know no borders, the imperative for African integration has become even more urgent in today s world.Central to all our programmes, from industrialisation, education, infrastructure to peace is the critical issue of free movement of people.The African passport was launched at the AU Summit in Kigali in July 2016. A process to convert this into an e-passport has started with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which will enable us to negotiate with other regions in the world about the recognition of the African passport. Member states were also encouraged to start the process within their national legislation to issue the passport, and the Commission distributed guidelines and the prototype to all Member states in 2017, once the e-passport process is completed.The 80 s and 90s have seen the devastation of conflict and military rule, including the genocide in Rwanda. As we therefore once again took charge of our destiny, peace and security, became a major priority.The AU Constitutive Act committed the continent to a principle of non-indifference, and put in place an African Peace and Security Architecture, to ensure that concrete actions are being taken to prevent and resolve conflicts.Moreover, the continent also adopted its frameworks in the area of governance, human rights and democracy, through the African Charter on Peoples and Human Rights, and the Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance.These normative frameworks, along with our programmes of development and growth, are the foundations for silencing the guns and building lasting peace in Africa. These human rights and democratic frameworks, in the context of Africa s diverse populations, cultures and religions, must ensure inclusion, rights and development for all, as the only condition in which lasting peace will reign.Thus, as we address the situations in Burundi, South Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Darfur and Mali, we seek to bring an immediate end to the killings and displacements, but we must also make sure that we assist these countries to build inclusive political, social and economic development and cultures of tolerance and peace.Across the continent, from north, central to south and east to west, the numbers of mass protests have increased drastically over the past few years. African people are out in the streets demanding better services from their governments, improvements in their living conditions, an end to repression and to corruption.The continent must therefore pay even greater attention to its development and to ensuring that we improve democratic and participatory governance, and rule with the consent of our people.Just during the term of office of this Commission, we observed over 50 elections in the four years. But elections is but one step, we must ensure that democracy translate into changes in our peoples lives and their freedoms.A key component of the African Union, is its commitment to building a peoples union, by communicating its programmes and involving citizens in its programmes.The women s movement remains one of the main drivers for continental development.The Commission, working with civil society and member states is also campaigning for the rights of girls their right to be educated, not to be mutilated and to end child marraiges.The work to build a Peoples Union is therefore ongoing, through Ecosocc our council of civil society, which is an organ of the AU and has representation at highest levels, and through outreach to all sectors.We cannot talk about African development, without talking about the mobilization of Africa s domestic resources, as the mainstay of our development and growth.The Union has therefore looked at domestic resource mobilisation, including public investment, strengthening tax systems and accountability, the continental private equity markets, pension and sovereign funds as key sources of funding Agenda 2063.Our continental priorities that I outlined above, form the basis of our role and engagements with the rest of the world.Africa is determined to take its rightful place in the world, as a manufacturing, trading, knowledge producing and region of innovation and technological development.Our Pan Africanist values, our development and peace models, our culture, arts and biodiversity, will indeed signal to the world (as Seme said over a hundred years ago) the birth of a new civilization, building on our past, that is uniquely African.This is indeed what the work of the African Union is about, to realize its vision of an integrated, peaceful and prosperous Africa, driven by its own citizens and playing a dynamic role in the world.There are major well-known challenges we face, but I believe if we focus on what needs to be done as outlined above, we can and will overcome.As another great Pan Africanist reminded us: it is impossible, until it is done.This is an edited version of AU Commission Chairperson, Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma s State of the Union statement delivered in Durban.-Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma
