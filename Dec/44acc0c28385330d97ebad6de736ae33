If workers in the mining, energy and construction industries want to improve their financial situation it is important that they engage seriously in some of the financial literacy programmes being rolled out by the Mineworkers Investment Trust in conjunction with Sanlam.This is according to Rita Ndlhovu, a project manager at the trust. According to Ndlhovu, the financial literacy initiative which is spearheaded by the trust, with the support of financial services group Sanlam, is aimed at assisting workers in these industries to learn basic financial literacy practices such as drawing up budgets and investing in small capital for the future.Established 20 years ago by the National Union of Mineworkers, the trust disburses funds received from its investment wing, Mineworkers Investment Company, to three key projects that benefit the community, workers, ex-workers in the mining, energy and construction industries.The financial literacy training started in the Mpumalanga province as a pilot study in June 2015. Over the past several months, 26 training sessions have been concluded with more than 750 individuals participating and gaining experience on how to better manage their finances. The lack of financial literacy leaves many languishing in debt and being forced to fight for better wages.In addition, it is not just the mining, energy and construction industry workers, but the whole country is experiencing problems with large scale indebtedness. The training was a success and the workers fully participated and asked questions. During my informal conversations with some participants they indicated that they were learning new things and that they would like other workers to be exposed to the financial training that they had, Ndlhovu said. Areas that benefited from the programme included Burgersfort, Mokopane, Musina, Phalaborwa in Limpopo Matlosana in North West and in Gauteng Carletonville.More training is expected to take place in 2017. What I would like to see is financial literacy training to become part of all training programmes that are offered by the Elijah Barayi Memorial Training Centre, a training institution founded and managed by the Mineworkers Investment Trust. The training content we provide emphasises on budgeting, interest rates, over indebtedness and debt counselling, she said Since its inception two decades ago, the trust has raised more than R400m to improve the lives of its members and provide them with education, enabling them to improve their circumstances in the long term.&#8211;Sollo Rabothata|sellor@thenewage.co.za
