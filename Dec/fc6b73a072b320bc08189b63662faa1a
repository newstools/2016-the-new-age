It is common cause that retailers can expect an increase in online shopping this festive season. It is gaining popularity thanks to the ease of access to product information, deal searching and 24-hour shopping practicality.While we do anticipate an upswing in local online sales, this contrasts with the extent of US levels where online channels are set to make holiday history in 2016 (according to the Deloitte 2016 US annual holiday survey).Although online sales have increased year on year, it remains a smaller share of the market. Overall, we expect online retail sales to exceed 1% of total retail sales for 2016.A 2015 Deloitte holiday shopping survey revealed that customer experience is evolving into a true blend of digital and physical purchasing behaviour. 30% of South African respondents are likely to engage in showrooming , where they visit a store to pick out an item, but then search for the best price and make the purchase online. 66% are likely to engage in webrooming , where they look at items online, visit a store to see the item, and finally make the purchase in-store.While we anticipate an increase in this shopping behaviour, retailers run the risk of ineffective product integration from online to bricks-and-mortar.Customers who view products online and go in store to make the purchase will be easily frustrated if products are not available, and more likely to switch to a similar supplier nearby, not make the purchase at all, or purchase a different item.When webrooming in the future, trust in the retailer will be negatively impacted.If online retailers leverage effective strategies to respond to showrooming behaviour, say where consumers can actively seek out bargains, buy them on sale and use their loyalty points to do so, they could capture a larger proportion of sales and grow online shopping trust in the consumer.Convenience, sales and bargain hunting, product comparison, price comparison and product information research are the main factors driving online engagement. Companies such as Spree, Zando, Takealot, Superbalist and Yuppiechef are in a strong position to take advantage of this.The challenge will be to continue to meet consumer expectations in the busy December period, especially with product availability, efficient delivery and return systems, well communicated promotions and sales, and high levels of customer service.It will also be interesting to see if there are any after-effects in sales from the Black Friday and Cyber Monday hangover.South Africans still prefer to touch and feel, and they appreciate the overall festive experience created in shops.Last year, we found that more than 80% of South African respondents to the survey intended to purchase from brick-and-mortar stores. We expect this trend to continue.The shaky South African economy is also influencing spending habits. Consumers are expected to maintain a conservative approach and will spend less on certain categories of non-essential items, such as holidays, entertainment and leisure, and allocate more to necessities. There s also some evidence to suggest that the so-called lipstick effect identified by Est e Lauder chairperson Leonard Lauder may come into play. Lauder noted that lipstick sales tend to rise during tough economic times as consumers redirect spending from large luxury items to smaller pleasures.So chocolates, cosmetics, perfumes and gift vouchers will continue to be desired gifts for women.Over the past five years, SA respondents have indicated that cash has been the most desired gift, followed by gift vouchers, chocolates, clothes and shoes, for both men and women.Parents might consider educational toys as an investment purchase with multiple benefits for their children.When it comes to physical items, the expectation is increasingly leaning towards more practical gifts, particularly for children.This includes an expectation of electronics such as wearable tech, gaming consoles and home electronic items to be part of the festive season shopping basket.The trends and insights over the past few years from SA shoppers has indicated that there is a willingness to reduce spending, which is reflected in the high indebtedness of SA consumers.Often during this period, consumer psychology reflects hope and escapism, that the new year will bring better economic prospects and an opportunity to leave behind the socio-economic problems experienced through the year.Total retail sales tends not to decrease over this period, it is simply redirected.Dylan PiattiDylan Piatti is Deloitte senior chief of staff: African consumer and industrial products industry
