Bundesliga basement club Darmstadt named Torsten Frings as their manager on Tuesday, handing the former Germany international his first senior coaching job.The 40-year-old Frings, who was a tenacious, tireless midfielder, takes over from Norbert Meier who was sacked on Dec. 5 after a run of five defeats in a row.He has 79 caps, including appearances at the 2002 and 2006 World Cup, and played 402 Bundesliga games, mainly for Werder Bremen with stints at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich.&#8220;We are convinced that despite not having a great deal of coaching experience, he will be able to achieve success in his new position due to his expert knowledge, his ambition and his ability to work as part of a team,&#8221; Darmstadt president Ruediger Fritsch told the club&#8217;s website (www.sv98.de).Frings was previously assistant to Viktor Skripnik at Werder Bremen until both were sacked after the team lost their first three matches of the season.After being appointed by Darmstadt, Frings said: &#8220;I was always a battler and a team player, and this is how I will approach this job. I&#8217;m itching to get going at this special club, who are a great match for my personality.&#8221;Darmstadt won promotion to the Bundesliga last season to end a 33-year absence from the top flight but are in danger of going straight back down again.They have lost 12 of their 16 games having taken eight points and are five points adrift of Hamburg SV, who are in the relegation playoff spot.-Reuters
