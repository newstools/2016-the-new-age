Gauteng department of human settlement handed over four houses to a child headed household , disabled and three senior citizens in Lawley Sebokeng on Monday .One of the beneficiaries was Thembelihle Mdluli, 23, who became an orphan at the age of 17 after her mother died in 2015 and the father in 2009.Mdluli said no words can express how she feels about receiving a house from the department. When both our parents died we never thought that there is someone who can do this for us. Today we are saying goodbye to a shack and entering our new home that is fully furnished, said MdluliThis is the department initiative to hand over houses as part of the Department s 16 Days of Activism against abuse of Women and Children.Gauteng Department of Human Settlements spokesperson Keith Khoza said living in a shack also had a negative impact on the education of a child as it was small and affected by weather conditions. By building houses we are also building a character of a person and also confidence,for instance the Mdluli children will be able to point at their home and also have a permanent address, said KhozaOther beneficiaries included an 83-year-old Esther Matshepiso Khojane and the family of 11-year-old Joy Dikotla who is living with a disability and elderly people.Matshepiso Khojane said owning a house was something that was a faraway dream for her. Living in a shack is hard especially when it is raining. I am grateful to everyone who made my dream possible. I am now a home owner, said KhojaneTNA Reporter &nbsp;
