The North West generates about R3.4bn of the tourism market share and sustains 48000 jobs in the industryTHE North West province generated an average of R3.4bn in revenue of the total market share of tourists in South Africa this year, sustaining about 48000 jobs within the industry.The provincial department of tourism said the industry has been placed at the centre of the developmental agenda in the province to highlight the importance of tourism in contributing to employment, social cohesion, reduction of poverty and mitigating inequalities, among other things. It should also be understood that through tourism, many other economic activities are sustained. This means tourism is crucial in the bigger scheme of economic activities, department spokesperson Dineo Lolokwane said.Some of the most popular attractions in the province include Sun City and Lost City (54.2%), Pilanesberg National Park (42.1%), Madikwe Game Reserve (14.7%), Hartbeespoort Dam (13.2%), Hartbeespoort Dam &amp; Snake Park (10.8%), Brits Mall (4.4%) and Potchefstroom University (4.3%).Lolokwane said recent research showed the Klerksdorp Mall was a popular attraction in the province.The Sun City Resort is one of the world s largest adult entertainment centres with the luxury theme park for grown-ups housing more than 2000 guests. Most of the visitors who come to the province are domestic tourists from other provinces, who also fall within the Visiting Friends and Relatives category. However, this does not mean that we do not receive international tourists. They may be in transit through the province but iconic places like Sun City, Pilanesberg and Madikwe receives a lot of international tourists, Lolokwane said.The department recently embarked on a campaign to reveal the hidden gems of tourism in the province to make people aware of some of the attractions that people may not know of.Some of the lesser known attractions include Thomeng Waterfall and Dinkgwaneng in Taung, the Taung skull site, Bloemhof Dam and Kgaswane Mountain.The Kgaswane Mountain Reserve is a place of special beauty, an escape into a mountain range of great natural appeal.It is situated above the town of Rustenburg across a varied habitat of quartzite mountain peaks and small, shallow lakes on the northern slopes of the Magaliesberg. We need to ensure that such products are ready for tourism consumption. Our observation is that many of our heritage sites may not necessarily be ready, given their proximity to tourist markets, Lolokwane said.Lolokwane said given the resilience of the tourism industry during turbulent economic times, even at the time of the world economic meltdown, the industry could cushion some of the economic challenges faced by the country. Tourism is an industry that will need the support of everybody because it is everybody s business, she said.-LILLIAN SELAPISA
