While many new home owners move into their houses before Christmas, the mystery buyer who recently bought the official residence of Gauteng Premier David Makhura will have to wait to take possession of the luxury house.This is due to legal processes that must be fulfilled and to allow the Gauteng department of infrastructure development (GDID) to do a background check including a financial audit of the purchaser.The house in Bryanston north of Johannesburg went under the hammer for just more than R17m last week.The identity of the mystery buyer is still being kept under wraps. Details regarding the owner of the house will be announced in the middle of January, GDID spokesperson Theo Nkonki said.In addition to the premier s residence, the provincial government auctioned 10 of 17 residential properties belonging to the state.The GDID will release all the names of the buyers once its audits and all legal processes have been completed.Tirhani Auctioneers, the company that conducted the auction, will hand over a report with full details of the buyers to GDID MEC Jacob Mamabolo.The province is working from a provisional list of 413 properties including unused schools that are up for sale.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
