Former ANC provincial chairperson and finance MEC John Block was sen-tenced to 15 years in prison for corruption by the Northern Cape High Court yesterday.Block and his co-accused Christo Scholtz, were in the dock yesterday, after both were found guilty more than a year ago on charges of corruption and money laundering relating to government building leases.He also received 12 years for money laundering. Scholtz received the same sentences.Block brought an application of special entry against presiding judge Mmathebe Phatsoane.Block was challenging the judge s impartiality and accused the judge of being biased.However, after a few hours of consulting, the judge dismissed the special entry application.Phatsoane also ordered that R2m of Block s assets be confiscated while R53m from Scholtz and his company Trifecta be paid to the national Treas- ury within 30 days.The National Prosecuting Authority had previously said it would push for 15 years in jail for Block.During the court proceedings, only a handful of Block and his co-accused supporters were present.TNA REPORTER
