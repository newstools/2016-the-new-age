The Mpumalanga department of health has set aside R64m to build a new hospital in Bushbuckridge.MEC Gillion Mashego said the construction of the new hospital, which will replace the Mapulaneng Hospital, would start very soon. The construction of the state of the art hospital will be completed after five years. While we are building the new hospital, the old hospital will continue to render services as usual, Mashego said.He said they decided to replace the hospital because it was very old and dilapidated.Mapulaneng Hospital was founded by Swiss missionaries in 1936 and was then known as Masana Hospital.It was transferred from the Swiss mission to the Lebowa government in 1976 and renamed Mapulaneng Hospital.In a previous interview with The New Age, Mashego conceded that some of the healthcare facilities situated in the province were old and needed to be revamped.A few months ago, the department spent about R70m to revamp the Sabie Hospital. The department also said that it had renovated the Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela, which experienced strikes in November.The MEC said his department was on a mission to renovate old structures and also build new ones throughout the province.In June 2014, the DA conducted a healthcare survey which rated Rob Ferreira as the second worst hospital in the country.Another survey conducted by the National Office of Health Standards ranked Sabie Hospital as the worst in the province. The department and residents face acute shortages of health practitioners such as doctors and nurses.In order to address the issues, the department last year announced that it had budgeted R24m to employ more medical practitioners throughout the Mpumalanga province.provinces@thenewage.co.za
