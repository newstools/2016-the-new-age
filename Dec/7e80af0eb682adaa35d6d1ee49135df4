Freed from a legal challenge the parliamentary inquiry into the fitness of the SABC Board, albeit the one member who is still on it, to still function, starts this week chasing a deadline of December 15.The inquiry, to be conducted by an all-party ad hoc committee, had planned to start its hearings a week ago but found itself caught in the cross hairs of a court challenge from the chairperson of the board, Prof Mbulaheni Maguvhe.He had approached the court in his personal capacity.He wanted to interdict the inquiry and was also attempting to get an order that would force Parliament to reconstitute the committee.However, on Friday night, Cape High Court s Siraj Desai dismissed the application with costs.Commenting yesterday, the chairperson of the committee, Vincent Smith, said: I didn t think that they had a case. He said the committee would start with hearings this week, probably on Wednesday and would continue with proceedings until December 15, despite the fact that Parliament is due to rest for the year on Friday. The committee will carry on. We ve planned to work until December 15. We plan to carry on with interviews and then take a break. Afterwards we ll work on a draft report, which we ll look at early in January, Smith said.This draft report once agreed upon by the entire committee, will be sent to the SABC board for its consideration and comments before a final report is submitted to the National Assembly by February 28.So far 24 people have been invited to give evidence in the inquiry. Smith said that if other witnesses came forward it was possible that this figure could move to 32.Meanwhile, the DA, which with the EFF vociferously blocked Desai moving from the shortlist into another ad hoc committee s nomination as the public protector, has welcomed the judge s ruling.DA communications spokesperson Phumzile van Damme said: The DA welcomes judge Siraj Desai s ruling in the Western Cape High Court yesterday evening that Prof Mbulaheni Maguvhe s application to interdict the work of the ad hoc committee has been dismissed with costs to be paid by Maguvhe in his personal capacity. She said that this was a last ditch attempt by one man seeking to cling to power for his own sake and to avoid accountability for his complicity in allowing the national broadcaster to degenerate to such an abysmal state .Desai s judgment, she said, was a victory for parliamentary accountability and an important step towards restoring Parliament s role as the constitutionally established body to scrutinise and oversee the actions of the executive.DENNIS CRUYWAGEN news@thenewage.co.za
