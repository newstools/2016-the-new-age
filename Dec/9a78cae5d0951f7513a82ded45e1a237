South Africa s N2 Freeway, which connects Cape Town with the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast along the eastern seaboard, is in great shape to handle higher traffic volumes during the upcoming festive season, regional manager of the South African Roads Agency(Sanral) Mbulelo Petersen said this week.He warned that to reach their destination safely, road users would need to plan their journey properly and so the information Sanral provided was aimed at achieving the objective.Peterson said road users would be able to travel the entire distance without encountering roadworks.He said an exception would be the N2 between Durban and Port St Johns, which would be down to one lane until December 15.Also, work on the N2 northbound toward Empangeni from Durban would continue over the holiday period, an activity that would likely account for some delays and interruptions.The south-bound carriageway would not be affected.In King William s Town there would be some lane reductions, again only until December 15. As a result, our engineers have rated the condition of the stretch between Cape Town and Durban as fair to good, barring unforeseen major traffic incidents or weather conditions, Peterson said.He said the road consisted of a single carriageway with climbing lanes for most of the way.He urged motorists to be mindful of stray animals on the roadside.In addition, motorists had to look out for pedestrians, especially near the Swartklip interchange, Trunk Road Two, Grabouw, Swellendam, Riversdale, George, Knysna and Plettenberg Bay.Motorists have been urged not to stop along the highway to buy fruit, vegetables or any other merchandise.The addition of an automated pay system on the toll road section north of Durban is expected to ease congestion.Traffic volumes are expected to pick up in the second week of December and a high number of vehicles will be on the road prior to the public holidays.The areas that will be closely monitored by the agency include Grabouw and Caledon in the southern Cape, East London to Mthatha and Port Shepstone on KwaZulu-Natal s South Coast.Traffic volumes should ease after Christmas and pick up dramatically early in the new year as holidaymakers return home.The automated pay system has been placed at the Oribi, Umtentweni and Izotsha plazas on the N2 North Coast Freeway.Road users with electronic tags no longer have to wait in queues at toll plazas or pay cash at the booms. Automated payment makes it much easier for motorists who undertake long-distance journeys, Peterson said. The system will reduce travel time and result in safer and more enjoyable road journeys. He urged motorists to report incidents to either the South African Police Service (10111) or the National Traffic Call Centre on 0126656075.The expected peak travel times during the December- January period is based on historical data and traffic modelling between Cape Town to Durban.Petersen warned that high traffic volumes were expected on the N2 at Botrivier to Caledon during the holiday period and this would slightly ease in the firs week of January.Extreme traffic volumes are expected on the N2 to Somerset West at Botrivier.Increased traffic volumes will be realised on the N2 at Caledon to Grabouw between December 17 and 25. Traffic volumes will reduce between January 1-4 and through the rest of the month.The N2 at Groot Brak, the N2 at Tsitsikamma, the N2 at Van Staden interchange, the N2 at Grahamstown West and the N2 at East London bypass are likely to enjoy a free-flowing traffic.Increased traffic volumes are expected on the N2 along Mthatha South between December 4 and 29, and motorists will experience low traffic volumes with no possibility of congestion on the roads expected.High traffic volumes are expected on the N2 at Marburg to Port Shepstone on December 1, 4 and 22 as well as December 27, 28 and January 4, 8 and 9.LONDEKA DLAMINI
