The abuse of undocumented farm workers is still rife in Limpopo with workers getting paid between R60 and R80 a day.Most of the workers hail from Zimbabwe and Mozambique with the hope of making a living for their families.Thembani Ndlovu, a father of four from Zimbabwe, said that working conditions were bad because they worked long hours and didn t get proper time to rest from their labour. The working conditions are bad. We work from 6am until 9pm. We also have water challenges that we face every day.It s hard to be a farm worker. You work for R50, sometimes R90 a day, under bad conditions and most times we are called k****s, he said.Ndlovu has been working since 2008 but said it s hard to apply for a passport since he doesn t have the relevant papers, which makes it easy for farmers to abuse him and other workers, knowing very well that they won t report them for of fear of being deported.Last year 80 undocumented farm workers from Zimbabwe were left stranded outside a police station in Lephalale, a coal mining town in Limpopo, after they were fired and evicted by their employer over a demand for better pay.Their plight exposed the exploitation of thousands of illegal migrants who toiled for hours for as little as R50 a day instead of the gazetted R103 minimum daily wage.Ndlovu claims that their employer had set his dogs on them and hurled canisters of tear gas at them. Six of our colleagues were hospitalised after he hit them on their heads with the butt of his gun, Ndlovu said.Department of Labour spokesperson Lerato Makomene said the employer was allegedly paying the workers R70 a day instead of the gazetted R103. The courts will decide how much he will pay as he refused to reach a mutual agreement on how much he pays each of them, Makomene said.Police spokesperson Ronel Otto confirmed the farmer and 10 accomplices face charges of assault and kidnapping. Home Affairs spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete said some employers were eager to take on undocumented workers to exploit them. We want such farmers and business people to serve jail time and not just pay fines, he said.provinces@thenewage.co.za
