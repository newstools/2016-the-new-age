The Ixoost EsaVox Speaker system is inspired by a Lamborghini&#8217;s quad exhaust and ventilation set up and comes with the automotive marque&#8217;s seal of approval. Like the most exclusive and most extreme cars in production, the Ixoost EsaVox is hand crafted in Italy.But what makes this company&#8217;s products stand out from the rest of the pack is that the sound amplification is achieved using the same principles and materials as sports exhausts complete with headers and manifolds.As well as a unique sound, the speaker systems &#8211; which can connect to a source via cables or Bluetooth- have a unique look but this is the first device from the company to come with full Lamborghini co-branding.However, all of this style comes at a premium &#8211; $21,000 &#8211; still it&#8217;s 20 times less expensive than the Lamborghini Aventador, the car that inspired its design.-Relaxnews
