Judge says he&#8217;s not convinced that the magistrates decision was incorrect therefore the appear is dismissed. @ANN7tv zinhle mngadi (@MngadiZinhle) December 22, 2016 The third year public administration student leader was arrested during the #FeesMustFall protest at the Durban University of Technology on 27 September.He was previously denied bail twice by the Durban Magistrates Court but decided to appeal the decision at the Pietermarizburg High Court.The EFF supporters for Khanyile caused chaos as they attacked a cameraman hindering him from filming the protest.Supporters took to Twitter with the hashtag #FreeKhanyile to show their anger on the outcomes of the court appearance.Constitutional Court expert Zahir Omar, said that South Africa has one of the most liberal institutions of bail in the world. The refusal of a serious bail is a bit of a surprise.&#8220;My advice to the lawyers acting for the Fees must fall leader is to take this matter on appeal either to the Supreme court of appeal.We should not allow the law to fall into disprute by taking the law into our own hands, the Fees must fall is a noble persuit,&#8221; said Omar.&nbsp;-TNA Reporter
