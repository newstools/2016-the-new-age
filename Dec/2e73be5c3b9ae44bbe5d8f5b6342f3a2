A controversial India-backed Aus$21.7 billion (US$16 billion) giant coal project near Australia&#8217;s Great Barrier Reef is set to start construction by the middle of next year, the miner said Tuesday.Adani Enterprises&#8217; Carmichael coal mine &#8212; destined to be one of the world&#8217;s biggest &#8212; has encountered numerous regulatory and legal hurdles, leading to six years of delays.It has also been criticised by environmentalists who say it will hurt the reef, a World Heritage-listed biodiverse site stretching along Australia&#8217;s northeastern coast, which is already threatened by climate change.&#8220;We want to start construction in the middle of next year,&#8221; Adani Australia chief executive Jeyakumar Janakaraj told reporters after meeting with Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in the city of Townsville.&#8220;There will be early works we plan to start in the quarter of June-July and we would want to start the main works from the last quarter of the year.&#8221;The development proposes exporting coal to India via a massive open-cut and underground coal mine 160 kilometres (100 miles) northwest of Clermont in central Queensland, and a 189-kilometre rail link to port.Adani forecasts it will produce 60 million tonnes of thermal coal a year for export.The project has been given the green light by the federal and state governments but is still waiting for a water license to be approved.It also faces three ongoing legal challenges, although Janakaraj said he was heartened by support from the state government.Palaszczuk said she had an &#8220;iron-clad guarantee&#8221; from Adani that the mine &#8212; which she projected would create 10,000 jobs and be operational for up to six decades &#8212; would not source workers from overseas and instead give Queenslanders priority.Janakaraj would not comment on reports that the federal government was likely to contribute Aus$1.0 billion to the project&#8217;s railway line.Environmentalists have slammed the prospect of government funding, saying it placed the interest of polluters ahead of Australians.&#8221;Adani has a mining licence, but no social licence,&#8221; the Australian Conservation Foundation said in a statement.&#8220;Any investment in coal in the 21st century is a dud investment. Australians will lose this money and it will fund the death of the much-loved Great Barrier Reef.&#8221;The reef &#8212; also under threat from farming run-off, development and the crown-of-thorns starfish &#8212; experienced its worst-ever bleaching event this year, which has been blamed on global warming.Janakaraj brushed away the criticism, saying the project was a &#8220;net positive impact on climate change in the world&#8221;.&#8220;India is a large consumer of coal either way. So if Australia doesn&#8217;t produce and give India high-quality, highly sustainable mining, it is going to rely on coal that will come from lesser reliable geographies,&#8221; he said._AFP
