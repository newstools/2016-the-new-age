In a move to accelerate competition law enforcement, SADC competition authorities have approved and adopted detailed frameworks for future cooperation on mergers and cartel investigations.The authorities last week held a meeting of the SADC standing committee on competition and consumer law and policy.The agreement follows the signature of the landmark memorandum of understanding between the SADC competition authorities in May this year.The benefits of the future cooperation on mergers includes reducing unnecessary duplication of work, delays and burdens for merging parties and agencies, reducing gaps in information available to agencies which increases analytical robustness and promoting convergence in the analysis of specific cases.Information sharing between SADC competition authorities on legal frameworks, investigative processes, timetables, procedures and confidentiality rules can increase transparency in agency practice to minimise uncertainty and increase predictability in merger review.Cooperation can also improve the quality of merger review and assist in enhancing the efficiency of merger review regimes.The SADC mergers cooperation framework spells out various methods of collaborating, ranging from sharing non-confidential information and general discussions on market definition, all the way through to more extensive cooperation, such as detailed discussions on evidence gathered or coordination on remedy design and implementation on the basis of waivers of confidentiality.Given the benefits of cooperation, the SADC competition agencies have encouraged mergers to be notified simultaneously in the different SADC countries. We are going to begin a process to harmonise our rules to ensure that there is simultaneous notification of transactions in SADC.Authorities have been sharing nonconfidential information about mergers filed in their jurisdictions and an increase in coordination for analysis of mergers filed across several SADC states can be expected without delay. Cartel conduct by companies is one of the most harmful forms of anticompetitive conduct, the organisation said.The SADC Cartels Working Group, chaired by Zambia and South Africa, has been in operation since 2015 and in that time has established two subgroups, whose work plans have also today been approved.The sub-group on legal frameworks, chaired by the Botswana, Namibia and South Africa competition authorities, will be analysing and cataloguing laws relating to cartels in every SADC jurisdiction, as well as compiling legal challenges that have been encountered during the investigation and prosecution of cartels.The sub-group on investigative techniques, chaired by the competition authorities of Zimbabwe, Mauritius and South Africa, will be exploring the possibility of joint investigations and engaging in capacity building, including staff exchanges.The SADC Cartels Working Group has already received training on investigative techniques and procedures facilitated by the Competition Division of the OECD, supported by the European Commission s Directorate General for Competition. SADC competition authorities have moved beyond holding talk shops. We are entering a new era of accelerated competition law enforcement in the SADC region, based on international best practice within the context of national laws. Thelma Ngoma| thelman@thenewage.co.za
