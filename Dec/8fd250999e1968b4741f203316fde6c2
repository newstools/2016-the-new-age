Lonmin, one of SA s primary producers of platinum group of metals has dismissed reports that it failed its workers by not delivering housing as recommended by the Farlam Commission instituted last year.It said on Monday it was confident of submitting plans that meets government requirements, after President Jacob Zuma threatened to revoke its mining permit if it failed to do so.Zuma s warning piles pressure on the company to spend more on workers housing at a time when it is cutting costs after being saved from the brink of collapse last year by a deeply discounted R.5bn equity cash call.Lonmin said yesterday it had implemented a number of measures as part of its ongoing housing plan and as the Presidency statement notes , Lonmin had completed the conversion of all hostels into 1 908 single and 776 family units. Our revised housing plan was submitted to the Department of Mineral Resources in October 2014 as part of the company s social and labour plans. Following engagement with and directions provided by the Department of Mineral Resources in September 2016 requiring certain revisions to Lonmin s housing plan, the company is reviewing its plan and is confident that it will submit a plan that is compliant, human resources executive Abey Kgotle said.Kgotle said the group s revised employee housing strategy, which includes the construction of apartments, is the product of a continuing survey of employees housing preferences.Lonmin says it will continue to work on collaborative projects to improve infrastructure and housing.TNA REPORTER |business@thenewage.co.za
