China had &#8220;real cause for concern&#8221; after US President-elect Donald Trump chose outspoken China critic Peter Navarro for a top trade position, Chinese media reports said Friday, as they warned of a potential trade war.Trump has picked Navarro to head the White House National Trade Council, a new office that will oversee trade and industrial policy, in the latest sign he is moving ahead with plans to overhaul US economic policy. The novice politician&#8217;s promise to return US manufacturing jobs moved abroad by attacking what he describes as unfair competition from China was a central pillar of his campaign platform.Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, has written books such as &#8220;Death by China,&#8221; in which he criticises Beijing for waging economic war by subsidising its manufacturing industry and blocking American imports. He has been hailed by Trump as &#8220;a visionary economist&#8221;, but the Global Times newspaper cited Chinese experts as saying that his hawkish opinions were pure hype and he was &#8220;not an expert on China&#8221;.Though Beijing could brush off Trump&#8217;s anti-China rhetoric during the election season as mere campaign-trail bluster, the appointment of people like Navarro &#8220;who have a bias against China&#8221; to influential posts was &#8220;no laughing matter&#8221;, the state-owned China Daily newspaper said in an editorial.Trump&#8217;s choice now gave the Asian giant &#8220;real cause for concern&#8221;, it said, stating that Chinese companies in the US should be on &#8220;high alert&#8221;. Yu Jianlong, secretary-general of the China Chamber of International Commerce, told the paper that China had no desire for trade disputes with the new US administration.&#8220;However, if the US keeps imposing inadequate trade remedy investigations on Chinese products, the country would have no choice but to confront the challenge,&#8221; he said. China needed to prepare for a potential trade war by identifying which products it could get from other countries and areas where it had comparative advantages, Jin Canrong, a professor of international studies at Renmin University, told the Global Times.At a regular press briefing Thursday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that Beijing was paying close attention to Trump&#8217;s transition team and how they would make policy. &#8220;We hope that the American side will join us in maintaining the sound and steady growth of the bilateral relationship, economic relations and trade included,&#8221; she said, adding that &#8220;cooperation is the only right choice&#8221;.But an editorial in the Global Times, which often takes a nationalistic tone, warned that it was time to wake up to the reality that Trump was assembling a team of hardliners.&#8220;If Washington dares to provoke China over its core interests, Beijing won&#8217;t fear setting up a showdown with the US, pressuring the latter to pay respect to China,&#8221; it said. &#8220;The US can no longer push China around today.&#8221;-AFP
