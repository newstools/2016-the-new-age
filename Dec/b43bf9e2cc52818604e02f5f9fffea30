Consumer confidence as measured by FNB/BER improved in the third quarter on the back of municipal election euphoria in August boosted by an increased optimism in the expected performance of the local economy, including households financial prospects in 12 months time, the index revealed yesterday.Consumer confidence surveys provide regular assessments of consumer attitudes and expectations and are used to evaluate economic trends and prospects. After slipping back from -9 index points in the first quarter of 2016 to -11 in the second quarter, the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) recovered to -3 in the third quarter.Although -3 is the highest index number since the fourth quarter of 2014, consumer sentiment remained well below the long-term average reading of +4. Depressed economic developments over the past 18 months has put many South African households under financial strain and knocked consumer confidence levels to near record lows of -14 in the fourth quarter of 2015. The devastating impact of the widespread drought, soaring food prices and a slump in credit extension has been a major drive, Jason Muscat, a senior economic analyst at FNB, said.Recent data from the National Credit Regulator (NCR) estimated that there were 19 million credit-active South Africans, and about 10.5 million of these have impaired credit records with some over-indebted. Overall, South Africans collectively owe creditors R1.64 trillion.Muscat noted that the improvement in consumer sentiment during the third quarter of 2016, came on the back of the forward-looking sub-indices of the consumer confidence index (CCI), especially the expected performance of the South African economy and financial prospects of households in 12 months time.In addition to the survey, the economic outlook index jumped by 13 index points to -4, while the expected financial position index increased by 12 index points to +16. But in sharp contrast, the present time indicator that considers whether it is currently a good time to buy durable goods slumped from -19 to -21 in the same quarter .The Reserve Bank s credit extension statistics showed that credit extended to households contracted by 2.3% y/y during the third quarter compared to a contraction of 0.6% in the second quarter. According to the latest CCI survey, the uptick in consumer sentiment during the third quarter points to an improved willingness of consumers to spend, but consumers ability to spend remains under considerable pressure.Investec group economist Kamilla Kaplan said: While confidence remains below the long-term average reading of +4, the improvement stems from forward-looking indicators. -Bernard Sethekge|bernards@thenewage.co.za
