Black First Land First (BLF) leader Andile Mngxitama on Wednesday accused Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema of political hypocrisy.He said the EFF leader says things he does not intend on doing. Malema&#8217;s politics is not about land reposition. He already gave white farm owners in Stellenbosch guarantee that he will not take land that they were using, Mngxitama added.He said this ahead of Malema&#8217;s appearance in the Newcastle magistrate court on Wednesday , facing charges of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act &amp; Trespass Act.He is accused of calling on black people to occupy all vacant land they come across in the country. He was served with two summons for contravening the act on two separate occasions on 26 June 2014 and 16 Dec 2014.During the last court appearance in the Newcastle Magistrate Court, Malema s attorney asked court to set the trial date after the High court ruling on the unconstitutionality of the Riotous act to which State prosecutor Jabulani Mlotshwa agreed.Meanwhile Mngxitama on Wednesday said Malema&#8217;s politics was not of land expropriation, adding that he had never led one land occupation demonstration.Mngxitama urged the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to withdraw charges against Julius Malema because there was no evidence that he had occupied land. In addition the BLF leader told ANN7 that Malema was now presenting himself as a warrior for land reclamation.Meanwhile, political analyst Sethakgi Kgomo said the EFF leader has a duty to observe, uphold and protect the law as a Member of the National Assembly.Kgomo said Malema&#8217;s comment was not in line with the oath he took when he took his seat in Parliament. His comment is inimical to the spirit and letter to the oath that he took when assuming membership of the house. He had brought the house into disrepute by virtue being member of the National Assembly, he added.-Sipho Jack
