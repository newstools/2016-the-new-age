Are South Africa s Beliebers prepared to fork out R15000 for a Justin Bieber Purpose Tour VIP experience?That s what concert organisers are offering for a socalled ultimate VIP experience with the world-acclaimed pop singer. While it s no secret that Bieber s enormous fan base always has his back, you d be mistaken to think that Beliebers across the country would be willing to fork out R15 000 without some questioning whether he s worth the hefty price tag. If I ever have to pay that R15000 to see Justin Bieber he better take me back to America with him after cooking me pap and mala mogodu, Twitter user @ GivVi_G wrote.This came days after Big Concerts updated ticket prices, which were initially priced from R350 to R1 540, prompting an incredulous user @Melody_Miya to tweet: R15000 for a VIP Experience for Justin Bieber without even a meet and greet? The backstage VIP experience will give fans access to a preshow backstage tour and to the Purpose VIP lounge among others.It remains to be seen if fans of the 22-year-old singer, who has more than 90 million followers on Twitter, are willing to fork out thousands of rands for their favourite singer who s recently become known for being rude to his fans and even punching them in the face.In a recent episode, a video was released which appears to show the singer punching a fan who tried to reach into his car as he left a gig in Barcelona.NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
