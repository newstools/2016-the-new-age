The most recent data from the Department of Trade and Industry reveals that only 3% of South Africa s economy is black-owned.In a country where 80% of the population is black, this statistic warns of the shocking state of our economy, where such a large majority of our population is so poorly represented.This inequality extends further than the ownership of business, to top management positions as well.A recent report from the Department for Labour showed that despite making up almost 50% of the workforce in Western Cape, the coloured people occupy only 10% of top management positions.Furthermore, a survey conducted by the BBBEE Commission earlier this year found that two-thirds of businesses are not fulfilling the requirements of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Act.Not only that, but the survey found that these companies were conducting a deliberate circumvention or attempted circumvention of the BBBEE Act , demonstrating how the established business community is actively avoiding the promotion and empowerment of black people.However, the problem lies not only in the corporate elite who appear resistant to move forward and accept transformation, but also in the reluctance of the administrative system to implement real change.This lack of senior black management and business ownership has a knock-on-effect, perpetuating inequality throughout South African society, with the median salary of a white male in the formal sector being seven times as much as a black male in the same position, according to research from data and earning analytic consultancy, Analytico.Interestingly, we are currently seeing a rise in black startups and entrepreneurship, in part as a result of tough economic times, limited job opportunities, low pay and rising unemployment.However, these SMEs face a number of barriers that their white counterparts do not.Access to finance for young black entrepreneurs is particularly bad. Often with no credit history or assets against which to borrow, very few financial products exist that will enable black entrepreneurs to get their businesses going.In fact, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Report 2016, almost a half of experts cited access to finance as a critical constraint to entrepreneurial activity in South Africa.South Africa is at the crossroads over the issue of the marginalisation of black South Africans, and something needs to be done soon if we are to ever make steps towards a truly equitable society.Big businesses seem to have little regard for the empowerment of black South Africans, one of the most serious issues facing our generation, in particular improving access to finance and supporting black entrepreneurs to compete on a level playing field.In some cases it appears the established business community is actively circumventing empowerment legislation. This must stop immediately.Own Correspondentnews@thenewage.co.za
