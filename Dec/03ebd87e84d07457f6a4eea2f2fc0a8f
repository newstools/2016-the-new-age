A 15-year-old girl who allegedly assaulted a fellow pupil at a Stellenbosch school is due to face a charge of assault in the Child Justice Court.This comes after a video emerged of the 15-year-old girl from Luckhoff High School being assaulted by her classmate during the weekend.On Wednesday the learner made her first appearance at the Stellenbosch Magistrates Court a charge of assault. She also appeared in front of a disciplinary committee at the school.The Department of Education in the Western Cape on Tuesday said it had launched an investigation into the incident that apparently happened inside a classroom last week in full view of other pupils.Another bully video surfaced to light at the very same institution showing a school learner verbally assaulting another pupil.In the footage, the learner is seen shoving the girl and pulls her ponytail.The Western Cape Education MEC s spokesperson Jessica Shelver has said the district director has called an emergency meeting with the school. The school has acknowledged they have behavioural problems and that running punitive processes is simply not working. Name and shame these people that like to bully others. They must be put on a public register #BullyVideo https://t.co/kkLRDYiGni Anti Corrupt (@Moeriusie) December 6, 2016-TNA Reporter
