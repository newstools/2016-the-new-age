PLATINUM Stars coach Cavin Johnson is a relieved man and should go on for another week without worrying about the axe. Following their 4-0 drubbing of newly crowned Telkom Knockout champions Cape Town City on Tuesday, Johnson will not have any sleepless nights for a while.He has been under pressure to deliver results following the club s poor start this season and that 4-0 victory has eased the pressure a bit. We are not in the best position in the league, we knew we had to come here and put in a good shift, we did that and the ball fell for me, he said.Goals from Isaac Nhlapho, Tintswalo Tshabalala, Bongi Ntuli and Ndumiso Mabena gave Dikwena a victory and also ended a four-game losing streak. Johnson, however, feels they have been playing well in those matches but were let down by poor finishing, but on Tuesday, they took their chances well. I always thought the possibility of a win was there, but in previous games the ball did not fall for us and we couldn t put it in the back of the net, Johnson said. You do say to the guys, we have to do better and try to create and score more goals. Against City, we did that and we put it in the back of the net. Johnson will now be looking for consistency in their last two matches of the year against Maritzburg United on Saturday and Highlands Park next week. They will be aiming for six points in their final two matches to end the year on a high note. But Maritzburg will be coming to this match from a good win against struggling Orlando Pirates also on Tuesday. They defeated Pirates 2-1 and will be looking to make it two wins in succession as they also aim to finish the year on a high note.nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
