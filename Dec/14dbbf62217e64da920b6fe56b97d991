Protesting students at the university burnt tyres.Hundreds of anti-Kabila demonstrators earlier defied a ban on marches against the president s plans to stay in office past the end of his term.Security forces faced off against groups of protesters waving red placards reading: Bye, bye Kabila. At least 80 protesters were arrested in the eastern DRC city of Goma, according to the UN human rights office in Congo.Opposition activists have accused Kabila of trying to cling to power by letting his term run out without organising an election to nominate his successor.The central African country has not witnessed a peaceful change of power since independence in 1960.The government and election officials have blamed logistical and financial problems for the delay in the vote, which is presently scheduled for April 2018.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
