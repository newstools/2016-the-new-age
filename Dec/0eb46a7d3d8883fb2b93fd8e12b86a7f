The ANC Women s League has come out guns blazing in condemning EFF leader Julius Malema over his claims that President Jacob Zuma wants Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma to succeed him as president of the ANC.The league said that the claims were meant to portray Dlamini Zuma as beholden to President Zuma and as a person who is at the mercy of the President with no capacity to lead .The league s secretary-general, Meokgo Matuba, said that Malema s comments reduced women to be nothing but appendages of powerful males and that they are portrayed as in dire need of blessings from men to ascend to positions of power. Through this narrative, Julius has displayed the highest level in undermining women s capabilities to lead inn society, Matuba said. His comments can be interpreted as the views of a patriarchal chauvinist of the first order, who doubts the ability of women to be political leaders. His utterances are worrisome more so from a public representative and a member of Parliament, she said. Our Parliament surely cannot be harbouring a male chauvinist and also succeed in fostering a non-sexist society, she said.Matuba insists that there is a concerted smear campaign afoot to discredit Dlamini Zuma as a leader. It is about negatively portraying any woman leader who has the potential to lead a political organisation as a stooge at the behest of males. The demagoguery, opportunistic political grandstanding by Julius is aimed at casting aspersions on comrade Nkosazana, she said.Dlamini Zuma is rumoured to be poised as a possible challenger to ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Zuma as the next president of the country.The ANC Women s League said that nothing prohibits Dlamini Zuma, like any member in good standing, to be elected to serve in any structure of the movement. She is a tried and tested cadre of the movement who is serving as a member of the ANC NEC and ANCWL NEC.She is the first woman to be at the helm of the African Union. She has served exceptionally well in various portfolios in the cabinet of the ANC-led government from 1994 to 2012, the league said.TNA REPORTER
