It seems there is no end in sight to gang violence that started at the beginning of the year and still continues unabated even today in the Western Cape, in what some experts believe are fights fuelled by illegal rhino horn abalone and gun smuggling worth billions of rand.No one is spared in the violence, not pupils, police officers, Metrorail train drivers, gays and a prominent advocate who have all fallen victim to marauding gangs that are making it hard for the communities to live normal lives.Community leaders have equated finding solutions to the Cape Flats violence to finding a cure for the HIV-Aids epidemic.In the most recent cases, two women were killed during the 16 Days of Activism for no violence against women and children campaign. Last week Dylan Pelton, who was supposed to start matric in 2017 was shot execution-style in Bonteheuwel.Three police officers were gunned down last month, prominent Cape Town lawyer Noorudien Hassan was shot dead in front of his house and Lekita Moore was stabbed 93 times in Valhalla Park in September and her naked body dumped in an open field.In Delft alone, 31 people were gunned down in August this year. The sound of bullets and the sight of bullet-riddled bodies has become part of life for residents in the gang-infested areas of Manenberg, Elsies River, Scottsdene, Delft, Valhalla Park, Bonteheuwel, Khayelistha, Nyanga, Hanover Park, Mitchells Plain, Lavender Hill, Atlantis and Ocean View.The 28s, Americans, 26s, Fancy Boys, Dixie Boys, Junky Funky Kids and Clever Kids are among gangsters who strike fear into the hearts of those who cross their paths and they are holding communities hostage. They rule the streets with impunity and prey on the poorest of the poor.Elaborating on the complex phenomenon of gangsterism, crime fighter Hanif Loonat said: The illegal drugs, rhino horn, abalone and gun trade are all part and parcel of gangsterism in the Western Cape. This is a R12bn trade. The whole concept of gangsterism has changed dramatically over the years and crooks are very sophisticated and operate this underworld as a business. Our police service needs to become more sophisticated and professional in their efforts to stifle this scourge. The biggest problem we have is that the real big kingpins are living in luxury in the most affluent areas while the foot soldiers are arrested. Intelligence needs to be up to get to the top of the chain and get the big guys behind bars, Loonat said.So far this year police confiscated drugs and abalone worth more than R100m and this was shared by Grassy Park Community Policing Forum chairperson Kevin Southgate who said gangsterism was like a Third Economy in Western Cape.On the stranglehold that some gangs have on communities, residents of Valhalla Park say that the 28s are looking after the community and in return they hide the drugs, guns and turn a blind eye to brutal murders in the area. The 28s control most of the streets in Valhalla Park and they target the poorest. They will look after you as long as you hide drugs and guns. Most of the unemployed youth are drawn into the 28s and in return kitted with name brand takkies, residents said.There is a general perception that as long as the unemployment and poverty is not addressed in all earnestness, gangsterism and drugs will keep flourishing in poorer communities.Teachers speaking on condition of anonymity said that the sad part was that gangsterism and drugs had infiltrated so many schools, resulting in several violent fights in places of learning.Despite the odds being heavily stacked against law enforcement agencies and the SAPS, there is hope on the horizon that the law has a long arm.An example is the arrest and conviction of disgraced Gauteng cop Christiaan Prinsloo, who sold guns to a businessman and well-known gangsters.He sold 2 400 firearms between 2007 and 2015, some of which landed in the hands of criminals.His conviction opened a Pandora s box and led to the arrest of prominent Cape Town businessman Irshaad Laher, 41, to whom Prinsloo is believed to have delivered about 2000 firearms.He is accused of selling the guns to the Americans, Mongrels and the Hard Livings gangs.Communities are following up on this case and hope investigators will nail all the gang leaders who have bought guns via syndicates, confiscate the guns and in doing so, make the streets a bit safer.VINCENT CRUYWAGEN
