While the latest wave of employment contracts termination of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) lecturers may seem as a good way to cut costs for the government, this move has far reaching negative implications not only for the financial lives of college lecturers and the uncertainty about their future work prospects but also for the achievement of the policy objectives of the White Paper for Post School Education and Training.Lecturers who feel the pinch of layoffs are those that are remunerated by the college council. We speak of lecturers who have dutifully executed their academic duties to the best of their ability in advancing the best interests of students. We talk of contract college teachers who have already completed their 12 months probation period during which their academic duties were monitored, though regrettably not being assessed for confirmation of permanent employment in line with the Collective Agreement 1 of 2013.While education expenditure has taken the largest slice of government budget, hovering around 10.2%, unfortunately the budget allocation for colleges has fallen far short by almost R4.7bn. According to the TVET colleges governor s council: The TVET sector was excluded when universities were given R2.6bn for students debt relief and consequently, colleges are operating under chronic financial strains. With TVET colleges facing crippling budget shortfalls and Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) funding plummeting, pink slips have already been handed out to many contract lecturers and the prospects for bringing them back may be more daunting than ever. This would mean that these colleges will not be able to increase their intake of students in 2017.The latest wave of dismissing contract staff came after the TVET strategic planning workshop was organised a few months ago by DHET and other relevant stakeholders to discuss most pressing issues facing this sector including among others, budget allocations, programme qualification mix, methodologies, enrolment planning, examinations planning and compliance matters.The TVET strategic planning workshop tabled a discussion document for TVET colleges strategic planning for 2017, which clearly provides that: DHET is planning to revise the enrolment targets in line with budget availability . It goes further to state that for 2017-18 financial year, colleges are advised to only enrol according to the available funding .Immediately after the workshop ended, a rectorate strategic meeting was also held to instruct college rectors to terminate the contracts of staff members employed by the council as a result of budget limitations in 2017.Terminating lecturers contracts, in my view, will be deemed to be unlawful as it is in contravention of clause 4.1 of the Collective Agreement 2 of 2013 which asserts that temporary or contract lecturers who have been employed for more than 12 months are to be made permanent .Of equally grave concern is the 63% threshold calculation that has not been adequately addressed upfront in these institutions as it is not mentioned in the White Paper, nor in the Continuing Education and Training Act, 2006 as amended, where DHET or colleges are obliged to use up to 63% of the operational budget for the compensation of employees.This reality, however, is far removed from the vision of the White Paper which categorically stipulates that there should be enough lecturers to cover all the disciplinary areas required by the colleges.In her research paper, Prof Ronel Blom identified the main barriers that continue to confront TVET Colleges, she said: It has emerged that conditions of service and the casualisation of work in general have had a major impact on TVET lecturers motivation to learn and update their skills to meet the additional demands. She went on to illustrate that TVET teachers perceived low status and the lack of a professional identity, compounded by apathy of institutional managers and restrictive funding regimes, seem to exacerbate the situation .Casualisation of the TVET lecturing profession has not only jeopardised the college system in terms of the quality throughput rates demanded by our economy but also adversely affected contact lecturers especially in relation to the colleges freedom to hire and fire willy nilly without complying with the relevant policies, collective agreements and labour laws. This exploitative system has increased dismissal practices, reduced regulation and protection of lecturers in the workplace and left a very little room for unions to organise and bargain collectively.Apart from professional development programmes for TVET lecturers that are still in the pipeline, the status and perception of TVET lecturing profession have throughout the history not been formally documented and the evidence on the ground suggests that lecturers are not the most valuable repositories and transmitters of the mid-level skills required by the labour market, staff morale is low and there is little research conducted on biographical profiles of the members of the lecturing staff, their motivation for choosing to teach, their attitudes and values, and their career paths.In the interim report of fees the commission, the underfunding of the TVET sector came to the fore. As envisaged in the National Development Plan, the enrolments in TVET colleges have increased materially. But this has not been accompanied by a comparable increase in funding or facilities , the report said.The casualisation of the TVET lecturing profession, dilapidated physical infrastructure, the legacy of underfunding, patronage-based appointments of managerial positions, the shortage of relevant human resources to handle increased enrolments, and the lack of relevant teaching and learning equipment for the provision of occupational programmes serve as a gory reminder that we are sitting on a ticking time bomb.It is clear the TVET system is swamped by major potential fault-lines and failure to tackle these challenges. The college sector s capacity to respond to the increasingly competitive labour market is likely to be considerably stunted and will negatively affect its developmental trajectory.Stanley NcobelaStanley Ncobela is a lecturer and columnist.
