Gauteng Hawks head Maj Gen Prince Mokotedi has said he had no clue that his boss Lt-Gen Mthandazo Ntlemeza was being questioned by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) for alleged corruption and attempting to defeat the ends of justice, therefore his allegations against Robert McBride could not have been influenced by that. I had no clue. I spoke to my boss today and he asked me about the affidavit. I told him that I trusted my source, Mokotedi said last night.He went on to say that he was willing to take a polygraph test, if that was what McBride wanted. I challenge Mokotedi to a polygraph test with me, together, on live televisions, at the same time, McBride said.This came just hours after an affidavit was filed by Mokotedi claiming that McBride was part of a meeting at a house in Bedfordview where plans were made to overthrow the government.In the affidavit, Mokotedi says that the group planned to assassinate him and Hawks boss Ntlemeza to pressure President Jacob Zuma to leave office by using information gathered regarding his son Duduzane Zuma and to mobilise for anArab Spring-style popular revolt.In his affidavit, Mokotedi claims that earlier this month, McBride met with controversial private investigator Paul O Sullivan, former Hawks official Shadrack Sibiya and some members of Afriforum and the DA. The attendees agreed that O Sullivan should collect information and dig dirt that would implicate (acting Hawks head Khomotso Phahlane, head of Hawks Mthandazo Ntlemeza, head of the NPA Shaun Abrahams and State Security agent Arthur Fraser) in any kind of transgressions, especially regarding acts of corruption, the affidavit reads.The information would then be taken to the NPA to prosecute and if it refused, the DA and Afriforum would then go to court to challenge the decision.The intention was allegedly to cause an outcry and possibly an uprising against the government.McBride admitted that there was a meeting but denied that this is what was discussed. He claimed he had been invited to the meeting by O Sullivan to discuss a document compiled by Afriforum. There was a meeting but there were no DA members. The meeting was to discuss a connected dots document, he said.Asked why the meeting was held at O Sullivan s house if it was to discuss work related matters, he said it was because it was a Saturday and the meeting was informal.McBride went on to accuse Mokotedi of leaking the affidavit to the media.Dudu Dubedudud@thenewage.co.za
