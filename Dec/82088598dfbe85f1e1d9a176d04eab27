Four prominent Greek and multinational food companies face the prospect of yanking goods from supermarket shelves during the Christmas holidays after a contamination threat by anarchists, police said Tuesday.&#8220;Clearly there will be a withdrawal, the companies will be issuing the relevant announcements,&#8221; a police source told AFP. A group called Green Nemesis on Monday said it had tainted several dozen units of products by Coca-Cola, Nestle, Unilever and Greek dairy giant Delta.&#8220;We have appropriated products from the main supermarket chains in the greater Athens area,&#8221; the group said in a statement posted on an anti-establishment website.&#8220;The products have been poisoned with chlorine and hydrochloric acid,&#8221; it said. Authorities said Greece&#8217;s anti-terror squad was looking into the case, and that the country&#8217;s food safety watchdog had also been informed.The self-styled anarchists said they had laced Unilever Caesar&#8217;s salad sauce and tomato sauce as well as Coca-Cola and Nestle drinks, and Delta milk. &#8220;The operational aim is to sabotage the above companies, forcing them to fully withdraw their products for two weeks,&#8221; they said.The group said they would be returning the allegedly tainted products to supermarket shelves between December 22 and January 5. The same group had pulled off a similar operation in 2013.-AFP
