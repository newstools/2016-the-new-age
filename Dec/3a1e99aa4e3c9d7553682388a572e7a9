Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola is planning to rotate his team for Tuesday&#8217;s Champions League clash with Celtic, but would not confirm if striker Sergio Aguero will get a chance to redeem himself following his red card at the weekend.City are guaranteed second spot in Group C behind Barcelona and a place in the knockout stages irrespective of what happens in the final round of fixtures and Guardiola said he would make a late call on whether Aguero would feature.The Argentina international was sent off for a two-footed lunge on David Luiz during his team&#8217;s 3-1 defeat by Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday and has been banned for four domestic matches.&#8220;There will be changes,&#8221; Guardiola told a news conference on Monday. &#8220;I am happy to give minutes to players who deserve it. Whether Sergio will play, I will decide today or tomorrow.&#8221;Aguero&#8217;s team mate Fernandinho was also sent off for his part in the melee that followed the tackle on Luiz, with the Brazilian midfielder getting a three-match ban.Both players are available for selection in the Champions League.&#8220;We are going to accept the ban from the Football Association and work with other players for the games,&#8221; Guardiola added.&#8220;I like all the players to play. I want to involve all the players. When we play every three days, the players must be rotated.&#8221;City came from behind three times to secure a 3-3 draw at Celtic when the sides met in Glasgow in September, and the Spaniard is anticipating another tough game against the Scottish champions at the Etihad Stadium.&#8220;In Glasgow, they played so aggressive. They are a real good team and it will be a good test for us,&#8221; he said.-Reuters
