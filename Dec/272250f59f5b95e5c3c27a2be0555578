THE tough start to life in the PSL for Baroka FC appears to have humbled coach Kgoloko Thobejane, who admits that things are not going according to plan.Thobejane is not only known as the mastermind behind Baroka s emphatic promotion to the elite league but also for his bravado during interviews.After the club s promotion to the top tier, Thobejane said they would win everything on offer, including the league title. But the Limpopo outfit has so far failed to win the Telkom Knockout and it doesn t look like they will be successful with their league ambition.However, the coach has identified the problem and aims to get it fixed by January. The problem is that we are unable to score goals, Thobejane said. We are very inconsistent. We lose and we draw the following game and that is not good for us. It was going to be better if we lose and win in the next match. We are busy trying to look for some players that can help us, especially a striker because obviously we can t finish. Possibly come January we are going to have a squad that can make things happen for us. Bakgaga have scored 11 goals in the league this season and only one of those goals was scored by a striker, Cleopas Dube. Other strikers such as Geoffrey Massa, Mfundisi Chauke and Sphiwe Gwala have all featured but are yet to find the back of the net. Bakgaga are 12th on the log with just 11 points from 12 matches and are three points clear of the relegation zone.They have not won in their last five matches, managing just three points out of a possible 15. Before the Christmas break they have three fixtures against Free State Stars away, Golden Arrows and Mamelodi Sundowns at home.Thobejane will look to ensure his team is not at the foot of the table come Christmas.&nbsp; Sithembiso Dindi| sithembisod@thenewage.co.za
