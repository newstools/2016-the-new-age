Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula has come out firing against his critics regarding the payment of athletes. He said the athletes know that even if it is slow they will be paid.He mentioned that he has a clean audit in his Department and said that every cent that he gives out must be accounted for and spoke about how patience is important while processes are being followed.&#8220;Don t bother me about money and payment of people, because I pay people. Its not an entitlement its a recognition.. I&#8217;m not doing them a favour because they deserve that,&#8221; Mbalula said.He said that when the Athletes came back from Rio, the Department and Sasscoc had signed to give the winning athletes R200 000 for their achievements.&#8220;I m not bothered by people on Twitter because I m there as well only a crazy person will want to challenge people being recognised and rewarded,&#8221; he said.The Minister recently had a Twitter spat with Olympic silver medal winner Sunette Viljoen regarding the payment of R70 000 extra money.&#8220;To award a person for what they have actually achieved is a good thing.. we will have people who criticize and say this and that.&#8220;But those criticisms and negativity is outweighed by positive results,&#8221; he said.Meanwhile Mbalula has gone to Barcelona to watch one of the world&#8217;s greatest derby matches between Real Madrid and Barcelona.The Minister will witness star players like Lionel Messi and Christiano Ronlado who are the marquee performers at the world event watched by millions around the world.Arrived safe and sound in Barcelona well received what an experience YEY!
