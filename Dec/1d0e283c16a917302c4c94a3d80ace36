Irked by persistent drought which often results in water rationing coupled with devastating floods which clog water pipes during those rare rainy days, the Polokwane municipality is working on plans to save water and harvest rain for domestic use. New municipal plans are approved with plans to have water harvesting capabilities. The municipality has a number of dams that are used as water catchments to deal with floods and also continuously maintains its stormwater infrastructure, Polokwane municipality spokesperson Mashidiso Mothapo says. Residents are also encouraged to harvest rain water for the purpose of gardening. In the midst of the drought this summer the skies opened up and poured with rain recently. Within minutes the central business district was overflowing with water.Traffic and people were caught in the streets that were flooded.When the rain subsided, water was everywhere but in the water taps at Legae la Batho, a middle class suburb and at RDP sections Extension 73 and 76, were still bone dry.Kwena Rabodiba of Extension 73 said: Every time there are floods I have to deal with an unbearable stench in my house because the toilets stop working. Nobody can wash. Relying on bottled water is not a sustainable alternative. It is expensive for myself and my children. Mothapo said: The pump station was hit and damaged by lightning and a pipeline that supplies Dalmada was damaged by the flood. Affected areas were supplied with temporary water through water tankers. According to the municipality, the damaged infrastructure has since been repaired and the water reservoirs were steadily rising and able to supply water.However, long term solutions include adopting water saving measures as erratic weather conditions continued to yield severe drought coupled with devastating floods.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
