South African batting superstar AB de Villiers has put aside his personal interests for that of the national team by stepping down as captain of the Proteas Test side.He will be replaced by Faf du Plessis. It was also revealed that De Villiers has been ruled out of the three-match Test series against Sri Lanka after failing to recover from an elbow injury.De Villiers missed the series against New Zealand at home and Australia away where Du Plessis impressed with his captaincy and subsequently received praise from some of the most respected personalities in cricket.De Villiers was appointed captain in January following Hashim Amla s resignation and led the team in two Test matches against England before injury forced him to miss the series against New Zealand and Australia at the beginning of the 2016-17 season. The interests of the team must always outweigh the interests of any individual, including me, De Villiers said yesterday. It was a fantastic honour for me to be asked to captain the Test side but I have missed two series and I am still in doubt for the upcoming series against Sri Lanka. Following the squad s outstanding performances in Australia, it is clearly in the greater interests of the team that Faf du Plessis should be confirmed as the permanent Test captain. I have known Faf for almost 20 years, ever since we played in the same school side at Afrikaanse Ho r Seunskool and he will have my unequivocal support if he is asked to continue leading this exciting Proteas Test team. Speaking about De Villiers injury, Proteas team manager Dr Mohammed Moosajee said: AB s left elbow is much improved but is still regaining the last few degrees of straightening. Fitness to play requires a full range of elbow movement and this may take another three to four weeks to achieve. He will be unavailable for the Test series against Sri Lanka and will target a return for the ODI series starting at the end of January. Cricket South Africa chief executive Haroon Lorgat expressed admiration for the decision taken by De Villiers and called him a true team player .Mahletse Mphahlele|mahlatsem@thenewage.co.za
