Achieving gender equality in UN staff appointments will be a clear priority for incoming UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, when he takes up the UN s top administrative role in January.Guterres, who was sworn in at a ceremony at UN headquarters on Monday, said achieving gender parity among UN staff would form an important part of his agenda for his first 100 days in office. In the appointments I ll be making and the first ones will be announced soon, you will see that gender parity will become a clear priority from top to bottom in the UN, Guterres said. Guterres was selected as UN secretarygeneral by the 15 members of the UN Security Council in October.His selection upset campaigners and many, within the UN, who had hoped the successor to Ban Ki-moon, the UN s eighth secretarygeneral, would be the first woman to lead the organisation in its more than 70 years.However UN member states proved unready to seriously consider a woman for the role, with several highly qualified female candidates failing to perform well in successive UN Security Council votes.Guterres, like many of his rivals, campaigned on a platform of gender equality, and is keen to show despite his gender he is committed to promoting women within the UN.He noted that the first target to achieve gender equality within the UN had been set as the year 2000 and that the new target year of 2030 was too far off. Despite commitments from Ban Ki-moon, senior appointments in 2015 and 2016 have repeatedly gone to male candidates.According to various media reports, one of Guterres first appointments is expected to be Nigerian Minister of the Environment, Amina Mohammed as deputy secretary-general.Unlike the position of UN secretary-general the position of deputy secretary-general has been previously held by two women.Meanwhile, Guterres noted the same concerns with gender representation applied to regional diversity in UN senior appointments. However, pressure from powerful UN member states to appoint their own candidates to high level positions should not overcome the need for high calibre candidates, Natalie Samarasinghe, executive director of the UN Association UK said. While gender, geographic and other forms of diversity are important, merit should be the primary consideration for every appointment, Samarasinghe, who also represents the 1 for 7 Billion campaign which has pushed for a more open and transparent process for the selection of the UN secretary-general, said. Several General Assembly resolutions make clear there should be no monopoly on senior posts by any state or group of states, Samarasinghe said. States, especially those that feel entitled to certain jobs, should field high calibre candidates. They should not try to foist failed or inconvenient politicians onto the UN. However despite the General Assembly resolutions, certain top UN roles are usually taken up by nationals of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, China, France, Russia, the UK and the US.For example, the head of UN peacekeeping, Herv Ladsous, is a French national. Rumours are circulating China, which has increased its involvement in UN peacekeeping, may have its eye on this role from 2017.Meanwhile, recent media reports have suggested the UK s David Milliband may be being put forward for the role of administrator of the UN Development Programme, held by former prime minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark.Milliband, who is head of the International Rescue Committee, may have appropriate qualifications for the role, however this would mean that the UN s top development body would again be led by an administrator from a developed country.
