The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape has dedicated a week to celebrate the life and times of its two liberation icons, Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo.The commemoration of Madiba&#8217;s death will be held in Mthatha on Monday. ANC&#8217;s provincial secretary, Oscar Mabuyane, says they will also be launching the annual OR Tambo celebrations in Mbizana, which will be preceded by the unveiling of Tambo&#8217;s statue in the town. We believe that these are people our young people must learn about. They have taught us what it is to be a patriot. We should continue being such people in order to build our nation and sacrifice for a selfless course, he says.In Cape Town, residents will be able to visit a replica of Nelson Mandela&#8217;s Robben Island prison cell at the Dullah Omar Centre in Rylands Estate this weekend to commemorate the third anniversary of the former president&#8217;s death.Spokesperson Majid Mowzer says ex-political prisoners will also be at the centre to relate Madiba&#8217;s experiences during the 18 years he spent on Robben Island.Mowzer says he hopes visitors will follow Madiba&#8217;s example and uplift the country. He says visitors can also view documentary programmes about Madiba&#8217;s life. We have been very kindly provided material from the Nelson Mandela Foundation. They&#8217;ve got a documentary about the life of Nelson Mandela and that is screening continuously. So once people have gone through the cell and paid their respects to Madiba, they can come and listen to his life story. In addition, we also have received a documentary that was provided to us by the Robben Island Museum, basically on the life of political prisoners. -SABC
