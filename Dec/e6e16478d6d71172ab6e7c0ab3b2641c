Details of those killed were not immediately known, he said, adding that the injured were being treated in the Muar district public hospital.&#8220;This pre-Christmas tragedy is so far the most horrific accident in Johor state for 2016,&#8221; he told AFP.Deadly road accidents are common in Malaysia despite efforts to crack down on poor driving, especially during festive seasons when people return to their home towns.AFP
