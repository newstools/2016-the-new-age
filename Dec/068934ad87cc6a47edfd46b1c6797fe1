South African rising boxing star Thabiso The Rock Mchunu will be on a two-fold mission when he challenges champion Oleksandr Usyk for the WBO cruiserweight crown in Los Angeles on Saturday.The left-handed Mchunu will be out to earn his first world title. Should the 28 year old bring the WBO title home, he will be following in the footsteps of another South African, the late Corrie Sanders.Sanders won the crown when he shocked the world by knocking out highly rated Wladimir Klitschko in Germany in 2003.Ironically, the 1.9m Usyk is also Ukrainian like Klitschko and this will be his first defence of the title.Usyk, 29, boasts a perfect record of 10 wins from 10 bouts while KZN-born Mchunu has a record of 17 wins and two defeats. I have been here since last week, Mchunu said from a training camp in the US. The preparations have gone well. I have studied this guy and I can handle him. Since I m shorter than him, I think it would be difficult for him to catch me. This is an opportunity I can t afford to let slip through my fingers. Mchunu is 10cm shorter than the Eastern European champ and his other advantage is quick arm speed.He said his opponent would be under pressure because he would be fighting in the US for the first time.In his three previous bouts in the US, Mchunu endeared himself to the local fans with a perfect 3-0 record.But Usyk s experience will count against the South African. The Ukrainian won gold in the heavyweight division at the 2012 London Olympic Games as an amateur.The Mchunu-Usyk bout is on the undercard to the light heavyweight clash between Bernard Hopkins and title holder Joe Smith Jnr.The bout is slated to be 51-year-old Hopkins last fight following an illustrious career spanning almost three decades.LINDA XIMBA&nbsp;
