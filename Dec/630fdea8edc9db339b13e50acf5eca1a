Pretoria High School for Girls has committed to improving social cohesion at the school by becoming more culturally and religiously inclusive following the release of a damning report by the Gauteng department of education.The report presented to the school by education MEC Panyaza Lesufi found that the school had been unresponsive to black pupils complaints of racial abuse by teachers and white pupils. A number of incidents were noted wherein either pupils or parents notified the school about alleged racial abuse incidents on black pupils, but no actions were taken or updates were not provided to the complainant. Furthermore, the school did not take firm action against the implicated teachers, the report read.School governing body chairperson Graeme Wilson said: The recommendations of the report will inform a proactive corrective strategy that is being developed to correct any systemic inequality or unequal engagement with pupils. We acknowledge and appreciate the constructive approach followed by the MEC and his team in this very sensitive matter, while supporting his call for corrective action. The best interest of all the pupils of Pretoria High School for Girls will drive our action in this regard. The school was in the spotlight three months ago after black pupils spoke out against the racism they had been subjected to over a long period time, especially over their hair. The girls alleged that there were rules in place to discourage certain hairstyles such as Afros, Bantu knots, dreadlocks and braids.LILLIAN SELAPISA
