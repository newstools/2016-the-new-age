Zimbabwe s President Robert Mugabe Friday denounced indiscipline among members of his ruling ZANU-PF calling for his retirement and urged an end to factional feuding threatening to tear the party apart.&#8220;Some say we no longer want Mr Mugabe. If you don t like him what do you do then if the majority of the party still loves him?&#8221; Mugabe said at the opening of his party s annual conference in Masvingo, 300km (186 miles) south-east of the capital Harare.Mugabe, 92, has been in power since independence from British colonial rule in 1980 has avoided naming a successor or laying out plans to retire.He once joked that he would rule until he turned 100.The absence of a clear successor has sparked infighting including verbal exchanges on social media in recent weeks between factions angling for his position.&#8220;As a party we must always speak with one voice and to our leaders, we do not run or organise matters of the party or settle our grievances through Twitter and Facebook,&#8221; Mugabe told the conference attended by thousands of party representatives from the country s 10 provinces.&#8220;There are organs which follow rules and procedures of how things should be done and no one person should stand up and say I want things done this way&#8217; .On Wednesday, the elderly leader spoke out against infighting among officials lining themselves up to succeed him.In 2014, Mugabe expelled his deputy Joice Mujuru after Mugabe s wife Grace launched a campaign against the former vice-president, accusing her of instigating factional fighting and plotting to topple the veteran ruler.Mujuru denied the charges and formed her own party, along with other ZANU-PF former members.Mugabe s deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa has been named the leader of a faction seeking to succeed Mugabe.Another faction, named Generation 40 or G40 because its members are generally young, reportedly has the backing of Mugabe s wife Grace.The conference which runs until Saturday is expected to once again endorse Mugabe as presidential candidate.-AFP
