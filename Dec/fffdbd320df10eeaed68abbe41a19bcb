The government s chief procurement officer, Kenneth Brown, will leave the Treasury at the end of the month after 19 years.But is he leaving under a cloud?Brown s dedication and commitment was unwavering even in light of allegations by Mzwanele Manyi, which to date have not been substantiated , Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said.Manyi, head of the Decolonisation Foundation, claimed in October he had handed a dossier to the Hawks which shows large sums of money had been deposited into Brown s bank account .Manyi said yesterday the Hawks were making very good progress in the investigation and had been in touch with him only last week.But Treasury spokesperson Yolisa Tyantsi said there had been no developments regarding any investigation by the Hawks after the Treasury had initially asked to see the dossier. They confirmed they had some documents (Brown s private bank statements) and would share them at an appropriate time but we have heard nothing from them. Tyantsi said the Treasury (as a concerned employer) asked Manyi for more details of the allegations but he just repeated Brown should be suspended.She said Brown s bank had also given him a clean bill of health. We have subsequently received four letters from Manyi and his lawyer demanding that we take action against Brown. The latest of these came on Monday, Tyantsi said.The letters referred to allegations against Brown but with no substantiation, Tyantsi said.Tyantsi said Manyi had tried to make a connection between Brown and Brown s sister-in-law who at one time was director-general of Water Affairs but the dates on the bank statements did not correlate with her time in office.Tyantsi said Brown was leaving the Treasury with integrity intact and that he was taking up a senior position in a highly regulated industry which was unlikely to employ anyone who was even slightly suspect.Brown had said in June he intended taking up a job in the private sector but the Treasury had persuaded him to stay on to solidify the processes and initiatives he led since being appointed in 2013. 701656-TNA Reporter
