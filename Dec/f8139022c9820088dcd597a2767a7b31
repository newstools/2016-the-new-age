President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s transition team on Tuesday denied a report that his sons were seeking donations of up to $1 million in exchange for possible post-inauguration access.The Center for Public Integrity, an award-winning group that addresses ethics and other policy issues, said a non-profit foundation was set up last Wednesday making discreet potential pay-for-play possible.According to the CPI report, the &#8220;Opening Day Foundation&#8221; was planning to hold a fundraising event on January 21, the day after the inauguration and Trump&#8217;s first full day in the White House.The report said major donors would receive: a &#8220;private reception and photo opportunity for 16 guests with President Donald J. Trump,&#8221; a &#8220;multi-day hunting and/or fishing excursion for 4 guests with Donald Trump Jr. and/or Eric Trump,&#8221; &#8220;autographed guitars by an Opening Day 2017 performer,&#8221; and other goodies.&#8220;Unlike political committees, such non-profits aren&#8217;t required by law to reveal their donors, allowing sponsors to write seven-figure checks for access to the president while staying anonymous, if they choose,&#8221; the CPI report warned.The foundation&#8217;s directors are Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Dallas investor Gentry Beach and Tom Hicks Jr., a Dallas billionaire&#8217;s son, the report said, posting a copy of the legal documents certifying the formation of group.The funds would be donated to unnamed &#8220;conservation charities,&#8221; according to a copy of a brochure for the event obtained by TMZ.com.&#8220;Opening Day is your opportunity to play a significant role as our family commemorates the inauguration of our father, friend and President Donald J. Trump,&#8221; the brochure said.Trump&#8217;s transition team issued a statement denying that the president-elect&#8217;s sons were behind the event.&#8220;Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are avid outdoorsmen and supporters of conservation efforts, which align with the goals of this event, however they are not involved in any capacity,&#8221; Trump transition spokeswoman Hope Hicks said.&#8220;The Opening Day event and details that have been reported are merely initial concepts that have not been approved or pursued by the Trump family,&#8221; she said &#8212; without mentioning the sons&#8217; registered roles in the filed paperwork.Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center pro-reform group, voiced dismay.&#8220;This is Donald Trump and the Trump family using a brand new organization to raise $1 million contributions for a vague goal of giving money to conservation charities, which seems a way of basically just selling influence and selling the ability to meet with the president,&#8221; he was quoted as saying in the CPI report.-AFP
