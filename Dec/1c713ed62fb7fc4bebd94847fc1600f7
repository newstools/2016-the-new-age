The bakkie drove to the road that leads to Middelburg .According to Bahula, Jackson advised Mlotswa that should he try to run he would be shot. It was then that Jackson brought a coffin out of the vehicle and instructed Mlotswa to climb inside.Oosthuizen assisted Jackson in placing Victor inside the coffin while using a knobkierie.Outside the court members of the African National Congress and Democratic Alliance showed their support for Mlotshwa.-TNA Repoter
