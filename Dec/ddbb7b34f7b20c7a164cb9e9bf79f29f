Former Ajax Cape Town coach Roger de Sa is set to take over as Maritzburg United mentor in the new year.In fact, De Sa has already started to familiarise himself with the surroundings and will be taking the team through the mid-season camp.De Sa, who comes with tons of experience, having coached at Ajax Cape Town, Bidvest Wits and Orlando Pirates, is said to have arrived in the Maritzburg s base in Pietermaritzburg to observe how things were done on and off the field.He arrived at the club s training and addressed the players, who were being taken through their paces by caretaker coach Fadlu Davids.Not satisfied with just understanding the workings of the senior side, the 52 year old has also spent sometime observing proceedings at the team s MultiChoice Diski team.A source said: De Sa was quite impressed with how the club goes about doing things. He is keen to take on the job. He felt that since Fadlu Davids has been doing a good job in the interim, he must finish the first round and he will take over next year. He also did say that he was awaiting a response from the South African Football Association (Safa) regarding the Bafana Bafana coaching job should the national association release Shakes Mashaba. Mashaba is facing disciplinary charges by his Safa bosses following a public altercation with Safa president Danny Jordaan, chief executive Dennis Mumble and other top officials following Bafana s 2-1 victory over Senegal in a 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifier last month.Another source said the Team of Choice management wants De Sa to come on board because he has proven capable of getting results even with a shoestring budget. Look at what he did at Ajax when he won them the MTN8 final against Kaizer Chiefs, the source said.Maritzburg chairperson Farouk Kadodia confirmed they were interested in De Sa s services. Yes he was here but we have not yet appointed him. We hope to be put out of our misery next month, he said.Should Maritzburg appoint De Sa he will replace nomadic Ernst Middendorp who has since taken up the role of technical director at Bangkok United FC in the Thai Premier League.Other coaches who have applied for the head coaching position of Maritzburg United include former Manning Rangers and Pirates mentor Roy Barreto, ex-Mamelodi Sundowns and Platinum Stars Miguel Gamondi, former Dikwena and Highlands Park mentor Allan Freese and ex-AmaZulu, Moroka Swallows and Polokwane City mentor, Julio Leal.LINDA XIMBAnews@thenewage.co.za&nbsp;
