For some time, Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has spoken of his desire to work at international level and to take the South African game to a global market.That happened when he won the CAF Champions League with Sundowns, earning the team their maiden appearance at the Fifa Club World Cup.The International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS) has recognised Mosimane s achievements, ranking him the 10th best coach in the world for 2016.Mosimane ranks higher than legendary coaches such as Arsene Wenger, Antonio Conte and Bayern Munich s Carlo Ancelotti.The Sundowns coach has also attracted massive attention from Egyptian giants Zamalek and Al Ahly, who have both indicated their interest in his services.Mosimane, who is yet to finalise his contract with Sundowns, is also up for the CAF Coach of the Year award, but does not look at the IFFHS ranking as something that can help him win the award. It will be great for this to strengthen my case to be recognised as the coach of the year on the continent but that is not my main concern. I don t want to read too much into rankings. For me, being nominated for this award on the continent against top coaches is an achievement for myself and for the club, the Sundowns coach said.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE
