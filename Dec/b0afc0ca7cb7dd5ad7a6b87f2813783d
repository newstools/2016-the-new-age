A century from Neil Broom set New Zealand up for a 67-run victory over Bangladesh to take the second one-day international and the series in Nelson on Thursday.After Broom&#8217;s unbeaten 109 was the only significant innings in New Zealand&#8217;s 251, Bangladesh suffered a dramatic meltdown when they were cruising towards what should have been a comfortable victory.They reached 104 for one in the 23rd over and were all out for 184 by the 43rd over, losing the last nine wickets for 80 runs.Part-time spinner Kane Williamson engineered the collapse with three for 22.The win, following New Zealand&#8217;s 77-run victory in the first match, gave the homeside an unbeatable 2-0 lead with one match remaining, also in Nelson, on Saturday.&#8211;AFP
