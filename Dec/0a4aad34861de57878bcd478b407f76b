Hot on the heels of the 20% for mathematics furore, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has called for the reinvigoration of maths teaching and learning in its entirety.Admitting that the teaching and learning of the subject in the country needed urgent intervention, Motshekga said the extent and depth of the problem was often underestimated in favour of reports of progress such as the recent Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS 2015). South Africa is significantly under-performing in education in general, particularly mathematics teaching and learning. Mathematics teaching is often poor quality, with teachers not able to answer questions in the curriculum they are teaching, one indicator of the challenge, Motshekga said. Often, national testing is misleading as it does not show the major gap at lower grade levels. Of the full complement of pupils who start school, only 50% will make it to Grade 12 and only 12% will qualify for university entrance. Motshekga was speaking at a three-day education indaba in Pretoria, which started yesterday.She said the revival of teaching mathematics could be done through classroom learning practices, content, teaching and assessments.South Africa is ranked second last out of 48 countries for grades 4 and 8 mathematics, according to the results of the TIMSS, released last month. The results showed that South Africa was ranked last for Grade 8 science out of 38 countries. When the report was released Motshekga released a statement celebrating the results because South Africa was the most improved education system in the world .Yesterday Motshekga compared the teaching and learning of mathematics in SA to a patient in hospital. We have since moved out of the ICU into the general ward. We need to get the patient discharged and healthy. It is within this context that we gather here today. LILLIAN SELAPISAsnn4@thenewage.co.za
