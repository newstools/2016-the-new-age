Southampton will hope Dusan Tadic has an extra spring in his step when they face Bournemouth on Sunday after the winger was named Serbia&#8217;s player of the year.Tadic will receive his award at a gala next week, the Serbian football association (FSS) said on Friday.The 28-year old has been a driving force in Serbia&#8217;s 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign, scoring three goals and setting up five in two wins and two draws to lift his country to second spot in Group D behind leaders Ireland.Tadic also won praise from Serbian media after playing with a fractured nose for more than an hour in last month&#8217;s 1-1 draw at Wales. He underwent surgery after the clash.Southampton will hope that Tadic&#8217;s speed and bag of tricks will come in handy in Sunday&#8217;s south coast derby at Bournemouth, with both teams locked together on 21 points from 16 games.-Reuters
