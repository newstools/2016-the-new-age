Motorists with outstanding unpaid traffic fines and already issued with warrants of arrest may soon find themselves in trouble of being arrested at their workplaces.This is an alternative strategy being implemented by the provincial department of community safety, security and liaison in a bid to encourage motorists to refrain from receiving warrants of arrest after failing to settle their traffic fines.Provincial community safety, security and liaison MEC Pat Ngomane said the department was concerned about the number of motorists continuing to ignore the payment of the fines and the department was working with the justice department authorities and other stakeholders in strengthening the strategy.Ngomane said the unacceptable behaviour by the motorists was happening despite the department having introduced the automated number plate recognition vehicles known as Nyamsoros because they could not be stationed on all the provincial roads.They (Nyamsoros) were used to identify motorists with outstanding fines or summonses by reading the vehicles number plates.Motorists were allowed to pay on the spot through the electronic payment system that was fitted in the vehicles.He said the task of raiding and arresting such motorists would be performed by the department s traffic intervention unit known for wearing red berets.The traffic unit was established by the community safety, security and liaison department in 2011.Its main task is to respond to various tactical situations on the provincial roads, especially which are problematic such as N4 (Emalahleni), R573 (KwaMhlanga), N12 (Delmas), N17 (Ermelo), R40 (White River), N11 (Emkhondo), R23 (Standerton) and R570 (Malelane). Nyamsoros are stationed on one route at a particular time and motorists can easily avoid it and use other routes, Ngomane said. In that way, we are unable to arrest all those with warrants of arrest. On the other hand, they continue to break the law because they know that they can get away with it. We hope that with this new operation we are initiating, we will eventually deal with other law breakers who evade the system and there will be no place for them to hide. Meanwhile, a worried motorist, Mavis Ngwenya, said: I do not think the new system will work effectively because it will also inspire us to provide wrong addresses to traffic officers to avoid being arrested at workplaces. Another motorist, John Mahlangu, said: The system simply seeks to undermine our rights atworkplaces. It will even encourage traffic officers to solicit bribes from us to avoid arrest as we used to do on the roads. FRANCE NYAKA
