Newly crowned Telkom Knockout champions Cape Town City are still a work in progress.Not so long ago, the team which bought the PSL status of Mpumalanga Black Aces only had 14 players on their roster after some refused to relocate to Cape Town with the team.They had to put a team together in a short space of time before the season started and not many gave them a chance to do well.But the core of the Aces team remained with the team which added a few good signings including Tshepo Gumede, Lehlohonolo Majoro, Matthew Sim and Roland Putsche. City top the Absa Premiership standings and now have a title to their brief history. We are very excited, we came to the game with the mind-set that whatever happens we are still proud of ourselves. We came a long way, Cape Town City captain Lebogang Manyama said. If you had asked me if I thought we will be here when we had 14 players at the beginning when we relocated to Cape Town, I would said no. But we have done well as a team, it s a collective effort and we will remain humble, we still have a long way to go. City are undefeated in 10 matches and have not lost against big name clubs Orlando Pirates, Kaizer Chiefs, Mamelodi Sundowns, Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United.On Saturday, they defeated SuperSport 2-1 to be crowned the Telkom Knockout champions with goals from Aubrey Ngoma and Judas Moseamedi. If you play as a team you are bound to achieve more. We work together and complement each other. There is no star player at the team, everybody works towards a collective goal. We knew what we were up against, we had to show up. The boys did very well and we are proud of ourselves that we managed to take the cup. NEVILLE KHOZA
