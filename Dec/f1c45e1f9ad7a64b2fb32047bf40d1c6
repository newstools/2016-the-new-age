Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) President Joseph Mathunjwa on Tuesday said they remain disturbed by the fact that Lonmin Mines bosses have not been held to account for the Marikana shootings.During a press conference Mathunjwa announced that the union welcomed Sundays update provided by President Jacob Zuma on implementation of findings of the Farlam Commission recommendations.However according to Mathunjwa the findings of the commission fall short of determining who was responsible for the 2012 shootings where 44 people lost their lives.#Marikana #Amcu Mathunjwa reading his statement- &#8220;Justice for Lonmin workers killed in Marikana.&#8221; @ANN7tv pic.twitter.com/j82Tuz9yza Kalden O Lachungpa (@KaldenOngmu) December 13, 2016&#8221; Lonmin officials are also not being held accountable for their role in the shooting of workers &#8221; said Mathunjwa.Mathunjwa called for the establishment of a another commission of inquiry to determine culpability.&#8221; We demand a commission to determine who was responsible for the Marikana massacre at the highest level. The Farlam Commission failed to find the real perpetrators of the Marikana massacre.&#8221; said Mathunjwa.Mathunjwa also stated that they were concerned with the charging of few senior police officials which he said were being used as &#8220;scape goats&#8221;.&#8221; We don&#8217;t believe that Riah Phiyega could have made a decision to massacre mine workers alone, it goes much higher than her.&#8221; said Mathunjwa.On Sunday the Presidency announced a criminal case has been opened against a Major-General in the SAPS for allegedly defeating the ends of justice.The unnamed officer faces four counts of murder and six charges of attempted murder.A case has also been opened against a Brigadier for allegedly defeating the ends of justice by failing to secure recordings of the extra-ordinary meeting of SAPS management in January 2016 while an attempted murder case has been opened for some police officers for the miners who were hospitalized with gunshot wounds on the 13th August 2012.On Monday police union POPCRU said it would be standing by the charged officers saying they remain &#8221; until proven guilty &#8220;.Meanwhile on Tuesday AMCU also said it welcomed the announcement that government was ready to effect compensation for families of the mine workers who were killed.-Siphiwe Mchunu
