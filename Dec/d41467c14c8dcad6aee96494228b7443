The African National Congress(ANC) Parliamentary caucus has labelled Wednesday&#8217;s walk out staged by SABC Board Chairman Mbulaheni Maguvhe and fellow executives as &#8220;disgusting&#8221;.Maguvhe alongside SABC execs staged a walkout after his urgent request for reports of the Auditor-General, Public Protector and Independent Communications Authority of South Africa be translated to braille, was declined.The ANC in Parliament said Maguvhe&#8217;s move was nothing more than an attempt to stall and frustrate the probe into the board&#8217;s fitness to hold office.&#8220;Today s walkout, including refusal to provide Parliament with documents, was designed to disrupt the work of Parliament and show contempt for Parliament s constitutional powers,&#8221; said ANC parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo in a statement.Following his request to have the materials be provided in braille form, Committee chairperson Vincent Smith said to the Chairpersons legal team that a letter had been sent to Maguvhe informing him that a request should be sent &#8220;at least seven days before the inquiry&#8221; should he require a interpreter.The committee decided to continue with proceedings despite the walk out.The ANC has also expressed much frustration with Maguvhe&#8217;s decision on Wednesday to file for leave to appeal the Western Cape High Court decision to dismiss Maguvhe&#8217;s application to interdict the parliamentary inquiry on Friday.&#8220;The utter disrespect that the SABC chairman and his lackeys continue to demonstrate against Parliament, including the very institution they lead, represents a serious attack against these public institutions and the people of South Africa,&#8221; said Mothapo&#8220;We will strongly urge Parliament to act decisively and nip this abhorrent conduct in the bud,&#8221; Mothapo continued.Meanwhile Maguvhe during a press conference held after the walk out said his constitutional rights were being abused.&#8220;The public believes I&#8217;m stalling the process, I&#8217;m not stalling, I need the documents&#8230;I may attend the inquiry but I won&#8217;t be able to cross-examine, he said.Maguvhe told the media that he is entitled to have all necessary documents as he was to testify before the committee.He added that the only documents he had received were the one&#8217;s notifying him about the inquiry and its program.Group Executive of Corporate Affirs at the SABC Hlaudi Motsoeneng added: &#8220;we respect the Ad Hoc committee but people need to give the SABC a fair opportunity to deal with sensitive issues.&#8221;Motsoeneng also said in his personal view he believed Vincent Smith was willing to deal with Maguvhe&#8217;s concerns.-TNA Reporter
