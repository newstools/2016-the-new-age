Japan posted its third consecutive trade surplus Monday as November exports held up, boosted by a sharp slide in the yen.The upbeat official data came less than a week after a closely watched Bank of Japan survey showed confidence among some of the country&#8217;s biggest firms rebounded for the first time in over a year. Monday&#8217;s export data showed a pickup in demand for Japan-made auto parts, although shipments of vehicles and steel fell .While total shipments overseas inched down 0.4 percent from a year ago, it was the smallest fall since September last year.Traders have been moving out of the yen and into the dollar &#8212; a plus for Japan&#8217;s exporters &#8212; after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates and on expectations US President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s plans to ramp up infrastructure spending and cut taxes will fan inflation.&#8220;Exports are on the recovery track,&#8221; said Hideaki Kikuchi, economist at Japan Research Institute. &#8220;But the impact of falling crude oil prices on imports is also fading so that will limit further growth in Japan&#8217;s trade surplus. &#8220;Imports of crude oil and medical products were down significantly last month, according to the official data, which showed overall imports were down 8.8 percent.The finance ministry said Japan had a surplus of 152.5 billion yen ($1.29 billion) in November, reversing a year-earlier deficit but smaller than the 227.4 billion yen forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. &#8220;Net exports were the main driver of GDP growth last quarter, and today s data suggest that they continued to support the recovery in Q4,&#8221; research house Capital Economics said in a commentary.Earlier this month, the government downgraded its estimate for third-quarter growth to 0.3 percent, from an initial 0.5 percent reading. &#8220;Looking ahead though, we expect the trade surplus to narrow.&#8221;-AFP
