The start of the court term in the new year will see some of the biggest trials left hanging due to delays during this year when they return to the courtrooms.Almost two years after Top Billing presenter Simba Mhere was killed in a horrific car crash in Johannesburg, his alleged killer is yet to tell his side of the story.The trial was marred with numerous postponements, new applications and objections to some of the state s evidence in the Randburg Magistrate s Court.The last postponement was early this month after Preshalin Naidoo s lawyers asked to be allowed time to prepare for cross-examination of a car tracker company officer.Naidoo s defence opposed the witness testifying in court and the use of GPRS information as evidence to prove their client was speeding on the morning he crashed into Mhere s car, killing him and a friend.Convicted criminal Rodovan Krejcir and his many court trials will be gracing the court corridors again.This month an application for his extradition to the Czech Republic was postponed to next January.The extradition, filed by his home country soon after he arrived in South Africa in 2007, has been in the courts for almost a decade.Krejcir had been opposing the extradition application until recently when he asked to be allowed to go back home in return for pleading guilty to murder and on top of that, spilling the beans on his accomplices.Krejcir s circle of corrupt dealings allegedly include high ranking police officers and other prominent figures.Faced with a jail term back in his home country Czech Republic and possible life sentence if convicted of murder in South Africa, the 47 year old is already serving a 35-year jail term for kidnapping and attempted murder.He is due to go on his third trial on charges of conspiracy to murder police officer Killer Ximba.In Limpopo the medical profession was shocked when a 25-year-old doctor Ndivhuwo Mudau allegedly stabbed his student girlfriend to death on the hospital premises.Mudau made a run for it but handed himself over to the police a few days later when his picture was circulated in the media.In January he is expected to make his third court appearance.DUDU DUBE
