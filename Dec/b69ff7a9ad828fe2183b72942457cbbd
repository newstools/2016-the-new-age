KwaZulu-Natal motorist has been given a fine of R40 000 and his license suspended after being caught driving above the speed limit.Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) spokesperson Simon Zwane said that the punishment was not enough.&#8220;We are calling for tougher sentences for speeding and negligent drivers. The drivers licence should have been cancelled.&#8221;Zwane said Sthembiso Xolani Ntombela, a 28 year-old engineer from Umtentweni fits the profile of the people who are causing mayhem on the roads and dying at a very young age.&#8220;The sentence could have served as a better deterrent if the licence was taken away forcing him to go for a re-test after a couple of years of not driving.&#8220;Ntombela&#8217;s conduct provides the most compelling reason why the Justice cluster should work with speed to re-classify such gross reckless and negligent behaviour and introduce a minimum sentence as punishment for such conduct,&#8221; said Zwane.Zwane condemned the behaviour of Ntombela and said that his conduct is another demonstration of the kind of attitude, selfish and irresponsible behaviour that is undermining all efforts to promote safety on the roads and save lives.&nbsp;-TNA Reporter
