The government has started sending doctors to initiation schools to inspect the progress of initiates as it tries to curb initiates deaths a move recommended by the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities as far back as 2011.Nearly 20 initiates have died since the beginning of the summer initiation season three weeks ago, three in the Western Cape and 19 in the Eastern Cape.The Eastern Cape cooperative governance and traditional affairs department spokesperson Mamnkeli Ngam said the provincial department of health is now involved with saving initiates lives.He said the province established traditional initiation monitoring teams this year who visit initiation schools across the province. The monitoring teams are mitigating risks during this period to ensure the safe passage of abakhwetha (initiates) to manhood. The teams include doctors supplied by the Department of Health. So far, the monitoring teams have visited more than 5000 abakhwetha in both legal and illegal amabhoma (initiation schools) in the province. Initiates in illegal amabhoma have been integrated to the legal ones and discharged the necessary medical attention, he said.Ngam said that during their visits the teams found there were cases of septiceamia, illegal circumcision, boys who circumcise themselves, dehydration due to non-provision of water (culture says an initiate is not supposed to drink water for a week after circumcision to heal more quickly).Ngam could not give the number of initiates who have been hospitalised. Our hospitals are not overcrowded as initiates come and go. They do not spend too much time there. There have been no amputations as yet, he said.He called on parents, families and communities to visit the initiation schools frequently to guard against drug abuse, assault and ill-treatment of initiates. More than 600 initiates have died nationally in the last eight years.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
