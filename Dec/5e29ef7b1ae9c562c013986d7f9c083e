South Africa s headline consumer inflation increased as expected to 6.6% in November, from 6.4% in October mainly because of rising food prices, Stats SA said yesterday. The Reserve Bank had already communicated after its monetary policy committee meeting last month that it may be close to the end of the tightening (rising interest rates) cycle, but made it clear that nothing was guaranteed as risks appeared to be high.Month on month inflation slowed to 0.3% from 0.5% previously. Core inflation, which excludes food, nonalcoholic beverages, petrol and energy, was unchanged at 5.7% year on year in November but edged lower to 0.1% month-on-month from 0.2%. Food prices remained elevated at 11.8% year-on-year in November, but down from 12% year-on-year in October.Food price inflation is expected to peak in the present quarter before dipping next year. Transport was a key component in the CPI uptick, with an increase of 6.4% year on year. Petrol prices rose 45c a litre in November with the year on year change in the petrol price component turning positive after seven consecutive months of contraction. The increase is attributable to two broad factors.First, the appreciation of the rand in 2016 has resulted in a dissipation of inflationary pressures on imported or import-intensive goods. Signs of an end to the drought has resulted in a sharper than anticipated slowdown in the rate of increase of food prices, Laura Campbell, senior economist at Econometrix, said. Any thought of interest rates being reduced has to be put off until mid-2017 at the earliest.Nonetheless, inflationary pressures overall are receding, she said. Campbell said the authorities are likely to be faced with a trade off between providing interest rate relief in the face of declining inflationary pressures and still soft economic activity on one hand, and a tendency for interest rates globally to rise more strongly than at any stage in the past eight years.-Bernard Sathekge|bernards@thenewage.co.za
