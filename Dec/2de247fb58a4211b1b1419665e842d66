In one of Kimberley s most dangerous informal settlements, Lerato Park, lives 86-year-old Katje Plaatjie who for many years hoped to have a home she could call her own.Lerato Park is synonymous with high crime levels where rape, murder and robbery are among the list of serious crimes.There is no electricity, no formal housing, limited road infrastructure, residents use communal taps for water, no piping infrastructure and residents use pit toilets.For those who received houses last week from Premier Sylvia Lucas, it meant a new start to their lives.Plaatjie is one of 100 recipients of the Lerato Park housing project and also one of the 10 beneficiaries who received their title deeds on the same day.Plaatjie said she would be living with her granddaughter Yvonne Modise, her husband and their three children in the newly built, two-bedroom house.The house is also equipped with a bath and basin, toilet, proper ceilings and running water and electricity. It has not been an easy process. When I got married I had to leave my grandmother to live with my husband at the Roodepan flats but after I heard an elderly person was raped, I decided to bring her to the flat to live with us, Modise said.Modise said they lived in the informal settlement since 1999, at a time when there were only a few people living there. For Modise and her grandmother, the housing project is a blessing. I cannot believe that I am finally moving into a proper house. I spent my entire life living in a shack and for me it is a blessing. The Sol Plaatje local municipality helped the shack dwellers move into their newly built houses.Mayor Mangaliso Matika said they wanted to make the transition from shack dwellings to houses as simple as possible for the recipients. We have organised our men to make sure they move their belongings as quickly as possible and in a more dignified manner, Matika said.Many of the recipients brought with them material they used for the shacks while others began building fencing, making their homes a bit more comfortable.Lucas said while it might have taken a while to finally hand over the houses, it was worth the wait. We wanted to build houses which were of good quality for our people. We as the Northern Cape government are committed to ensuring that people have a decent quality of life, Lucas said.Lucas said those who were vulnerable received first preference for phase two of the housing project.NOMUSA MVUBU
