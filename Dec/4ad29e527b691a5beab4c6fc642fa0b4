This represents a big step forward in terms of testing the technology, said Marco van Basten, FIFA s Chief Officer Technical Development. We feel well prepared after setting everything up with the support of The IFAB, the host broadcaster Dentsu/NTV and Hawk-Eye one of a number of providers that offer such technology. At the same time, it s important to remember that we are entering somewhat unchartered territory here, given that we are going live for the first time. Ultimately, these tests should prove invaluable in terms of determining whether the processes are sound or whether any further refinements are needed. said van BastenThis trial will involve video assistant referees (VARs) being given access to all broadcast feeds inside a video operations room, enabling them to provide information to the referee on the field of play in order to correct clear mistakes in match-changing situations, FIFA s Head of Refereeing Massimo Busacca saidBusacca also explains that these include serious incidents including goals, penalty decisions, direct red cards and cases of mistaken identity. The VARs will play a supporting role along with the assistant referees and the fourth official, but the referee will continue to take the first as well as the final decision on the field of play. The VAR system has been developed, just like goal-line technology, to provide additional support for the referee, he saidThe Football governing body says that the trial involves video assistant referees (VARs) being given access to all broadcast feeds inside a video operations room, enabling them to provide information to the referee on the field of play in order to correct clear mistakes in match-changing situations.The referees and VARs have participated in intensive theoretical and practical training sessions organised by the Fifa Refereeing Department during the week leading up to the competition.The points of emphasis were on the football understanding , reading the game , positioning , teamwork and different football mentalities, with the goal of achieving consistency and uniformity.The match officials also reviewed video clips of real life match situations and participated in practical training sessions with players, so that filmed so that the participants could receive instant feedback from top FIFA refereeing instructors.By using this technology during the competition will be putting The IFAB&#8217;s VAR protocol through an important test before other competition organisers begin conducting live trials from 2017 onwards.The referee will be able to review footage on a pitch side monitor for certain decisions a key progression from the semi-live tests conducted at recent international friendly matches in Italy Italy v. France in Bari in September and during the Italy v. Germany in Milan in November.-TNA Reporter&nbsp;
