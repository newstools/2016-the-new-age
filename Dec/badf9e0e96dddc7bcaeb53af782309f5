WITH a total of four Grammy s under their belt, there s no sign of slowing down for Ladysmith Black Mambazo, as it helped ensure that South Africa got two 2017 Grammy nominations yesterday.The South African acappella singing group received a nomination in the best world music category for Walking In The Footsteps Of Our Fathers, while another Mzansi-born talent, London-based fortepianist Kristian Bezuidenhout, received a nomination in the world field for best classical instrumental solo.This marks Mambazo s 17th Grammy award nomination, noted by Nelson Mandela as the South African cultural ambassadors of the world. Renowned for their modern iscathamiya sound, the top selling allmale choral group has received the Grammy award four times in 1988 for Shaka Zulu, in 2004 for Raise Your Spirit Higher, in 2009 for Ilembe and in 2013 for Singing For Peace Around The World.Equally at home on the so-called unruly keyboard instrument that can be played soft or loud, Bezuidenhout, 37, is one of today s most brilliant Mozart s fortepiano players. He has been nominated for a Grammy twice before.Led by pop diva Beyonc with nine nominations and followed by Rihanna, Drake and Kanye with eight nods, the 59th annual Grammy Awards ceremony will be held on February 12 at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles.-TNA Reporter
