DEPUTY President Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday received little welcome in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni where he was booed by hundreds of angry community healthcare workers, who have complained of not being paid for months on end.Ramaphosa and a delegation of government officials including Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi were booed by the crowd while Ramaphosa was giving a keynote address during the World Aids Day event at Sinaba stadium. Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina was forced to attend to the group, who showed no sign of relenting.Ramaphosa moved to assure the group that their concerns were heard and that they would be attended to. I m able to tell you that we have heard you, in fact the minster of health has raised this issue prominently and has put forward proposals on what the government should do to deal with the issue of community workers, Ramaphosa said.The deputy said the minimum wage did not apply to community health workers. Ramaphosa hailed the progress made in the fight against Aids but warned the country cannot be complacent given the high rate of infections among young women. He thanked community health workers for their commitment to healthcare in the country. As we mark World Aids Day we dare not be content with where we are at. South Africa is facing an HIV infection emergency, he said.The deputy president pleaded with so-called sugar daddies not to target young girls. We need to act now to significantly reduce new HIV infections. If we do not do so, the progress we have made against HIV will be eroded, Ramaphosa said. There are nearly 6.75 million people infected with HIV in the country, with 3.3 million on ARV treatment. South African National Aids Council CEO Dr Fareed Abdullah said the country had come a long way, but that they were however concerned about new infections among young women. Ramaphosa said the government would meet with representatives of the community health workers today.leratod@thenewage.co.za-Lerato Diale
