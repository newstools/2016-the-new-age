Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies has welcomed a R150m investment by a Chinese company.The manufacturing investment is by Yangtze Optics Africa Cable (YOAC) in Durban s Dube Trade Port industrial development zone.Davies said the investment was strategic in terms of building local capacity in manufacturing fibre optic cables.The investment sets up an optical fibre cable manufacturing plant in South Africa by Yangtze Optical Fibre and Cable Joint Stock Limited Company from China, as well as JSE-listed Mustek Limited.Davies said that the investment is a boost in terms of our bilateral relations with China and the commitment made by the Chinese government towards building industrial capacity on the African continent.This follows the Forum on ChinaAfrica Cooperation that took place in December last year, and the recent BiNational Commission (BNC) with China held last month.During the BNC, Chinese VicePresident Dr Li Yuanchou commended South Africa for building world-class infrastructure in special economic zones to attract investment.Davies said that YOAC s optical fibre cable manufacturing plant, with an initial capacity of one million fibre kilometres, will introduce new modern manufacturing equipment and processes, in the manufacturing of optical fibre cable in SA.He also said it is the intention of YOAC to manufacture a range of new generation optical fibre cable products for the SA Information and Communication Technology and broadband market, as well as key export markets in West and east Africa. The construction on the optical fibre cable plant started in May this year after a soil-turning event attended by Chinese and South Africa government officials. The build and installation phase of the project was completed by end of November, a mere six months from the start of the plant construction. We are able to roll out green field plants in record time, which bodes well for the Dube Trade Port as an attractive investment value proposition, Davies said.He said the new manufacturing facility is expected to create a number of hitech new jobs within the sector and that high-level technical skills development will be at the forefront of the company s skills development programme. To date, YOAC has recruited 42 employees of which a significant majority were sourced from local communities adjacent to the King Shaka International Airport. YOAC intends to create a further 80 employment opportunities next year. Nearly two-thirds of the employment opportunities created are technical positions, requiring additional technical skills transfer training from YOFC Davies said.The plan for the next phase is to build an optical fibre drawing facility, which will mainly produce optical fibre, which is the main raw material for cable production.South Africa remains an attractive investment destination for high tech advanced manufacturing sectors and reinforces our collaboration on a bilateral level with China, Davies said.-Thelma Ngoma
