Champions Leicester continued their slide towards a New Year Premier League relegation fight as they were beaten 2-0 at home by Everton on Monday despite dominating the match.Everton, still stinging from their stoppage-time derby defeat by Liverpool last week, created almost nothing until Kevin Mirallas ran on to a long clearance from goalkeeper Joel Robles and scored with a deflected shot six minutes into the second half.Leicester looked toothless without the suspended Jamie Vardy but the striker at least joined in the festive fun by donning one of 30,000 Jamie Vardy masks produced by the club and worn by fans in protest at his ban following a red card.There were precious few smiles among the home supporters at the end, however, as, after Idrissa Gueye blazed over the bar for the visitors, Romelu Lukaku finished off another counter attack with a crisp shot to make it 2-0 in stoppage time.The result lifted Everton up to seventh and left the champions two places and three points above the relegation zone.-Reuters
