The African National Congress (ANC) in the North West has called for North West University lecturer Theo Venter to withdraw a Facebook post which they say defames Premier Supra Mahumapelo.On Thursday Venter added a comment to a Facebook post saying &#8220;The friends of the Supra Mahumapelo and Ace Magasule. They even have a mine near Klerksdorp, ready to deliver uranium for the nuclear power stations that we do not need! On Friday ANC Provincial Secretary Dakota Legoete said Venter&#8217;s comments were irresponsible and he was spreading lies.&#8221; Nowhere in the media reports related to the story that Venter attached to his post does the name of our Provincial Chairperson come up or any reference made to his position either in the ANC or in government. That then begs the question as to why Venter saw it fit to drag Cde Supra into the story. &#8221; Legoete said in a statement.The ANC says considering Venter&#8217;s calibre as an academic, he should know that one cannot defame another person you cannot just wake up and decide to taint someone s name simply because you do not like them, Legoete said in a statementAccording to the North-West University website Venter is a special adviser at the NWU School of Business and Governance whose expertise is in Political and Policy analysis.At the time of publishing Mr Venter had yet to respond to a email requesting comment from him.-TNA Reporter
