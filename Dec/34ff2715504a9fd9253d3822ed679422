Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp refused to criticise Loris Karius for failing to keep out West Ham United&#8217;s opening goal by Dimitri Payet as the home team were held to a 2-2 draw at Anfield on Sunday.One week after Karius gifted Bournemouth their winner in a 4-3 victory on the south coast, the German keeper palmed the ball weakly into the net despite getting across goal to meet Payet&#8217;s 27th-minute free kick.Asked if his fellow countryman was standing too far to the left, Klopp replied &#8220;no idea&#8221; in his post-match television interview, saying he had only seen the goal live and would need to watch it again before giving a considered view.&#8220;For the first goal, don&#8217;t make the foul, don&#8217;t lose the ball,&#8221; Klopp added.&#8220;The second goal (by Michail Antonio) was unlucky. (Defender) Joel Matip made a fantastic game and in this moment he couldn&#8217;t clear the ball. Loris Karius was surprised and it was too late.&#8221;Klopp said that while Liverpool blew a winning position for the second time in a week, Sunday&#8217;s result was very different from the Bournemouth defeat.&#8220;Similar to last week? No, these games are not comparable. We drew. We are a good football side,&#8221; he added.&#8220;The goals could have been avoided. That&#8217;s how it is in football. Mixed emotions, it&#8217;s still a point. A draw doesn&#8217;t feel too good. doesn&#8217;t feel too bad.&#8221;Klopp did however say that Liverpool were below their best and should have won a game where they enjoyed 59 touches in the opposition box against West Ham&#8217;s five at the other end.&#8220;Below our best? Yes, that&#8217;s right. Actually we had this in other games where we were ahead and clear. The situation is what it is,&#8221; said the German.With England forward Daniel Sturridge injured, Liverpool&#8217;s striking options were restricted to 17-year-old Ben Woodburn on the substitutes&#8217; bench.&#8220;In a game like this it&#8217;s quite difficult to bring the young players on as substitutes,&#8221; said Klopp.-Reuters
