Token currency thus far flounders as citizens and companies fear hyperinflation of the past HarareA token currency issued in Zimbabwe this week to ease critical cash shortages has brought little relief as desperate customers queue for hours to withdraw money while some traders reject the new notes.The central bank on Monday issued $10m (R140m) in US dollar-equivalent bond notes , ignoring resistance from citizens and companies who feared a return to the days of hyperinflation.But a day later, taxi driver Adrian Nyakusvipa said the new currency had brought no relief to his painfully slow business. We thought there would be a difference after the introduction of bond notes but nothing has changed so far, Nyakusvipa said. I have been parked here since the morning without a single customer. Zimbabwe abandoned its currency in 2009 after rampant hyperinflation, which peaked at 500 billion percent, rendered the local dollar useless.The adoption of foreign currencies like the US dollar and the South African rand brought relative economic stability. But the gains were lost as the government pursued aggressive policies that scared off investors, including indigenisation laws forcing foreign-owned companies to sell majority stakes to locals.The cash shortage has exacerbated the situation in recent months, with the government unable to pay soldiers and civil servants on time and customers camping out at bank entrances overnight, desperately hoping to get hold of the little cash available.It was these shortages that prompted the central bank to introduce the bond notes, officially a parallel currency to the greenback, which the government said is backed by a $200m facility from the African Export-Import Bank.But when the plans were announced in May, citizens and pressure groups took to the streets, fearing a return to the days of hyperinflation when shop prices could jump several times in a single day.Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai called the move a desperate attempt by a government that had run out of ideas to tackle an unprecedented crisis .Standing in line outside a bank in the capital, Lynely Mabona worried the new currency could be used to wipe out her US dollar bank balance. I have been waiting here for hours. All I want is to get as much of my US balance as I can out of the bank, she said.Some banks had already run out of US dollars and were giving out only bond notes.Some fuel stations were refusing payment in bond notes.But across Harare, a popular saying became the common refrain: We have no choice but to dance to the tune being played.
