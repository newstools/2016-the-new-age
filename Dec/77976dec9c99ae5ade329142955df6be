The DA has optimistically said that the unity and tenacity shown by the committee investigating the SABC board will flow into other parliamentary working groups.The ad hoc committee, which represents all political views seated in the National Assembly, completed the first section of its investigation into the fitness of the SABC board last week.Members of Parliament have gone on a Christmas break. They will return to Parliament next month to interview two former chairpersons of the board, Ben Ngubane and Ellen Tshabalala on January 10.During the break, ad hoc committee members will peruse 577 documents supplied by the SABC. The DA said it would plough through these documents to get to the bottom of what has happened at the SABC, devise concrete steps about what needs to happen to fix the SABC and to hold those responsible accountable. We trust that the tough, no-holds barred manner in which the SABC ad hoc committee conducted hearings is a cautionary tale for all other SOEs. You will be caught. You will be held accountable. We trust that this is not a once-off occurrence and will happen in all other committees in Parliament, the DA said.Reviewing the seven days that the ad hoc committee had sat, the DA said members of the committee had met for up to 12 hours a day hearing testimony from witnesses describing deep-set rot and complete collapse of good governance at the public broadcaster. It s disappointing that despite being given the opportunity to refute all claims, the SABC s executive team, under the leadership of acting CEO James Aguma elected not to present itself to the committee to tell its side of the story and explain to the public how their licence fees have been spent. We will push for this to happen early next year, with the expected appearances of former board chairs, Ellen Tshabalala and Dr Ben Ngubane. Dennis Cruywagennews@thenewage.co.za
