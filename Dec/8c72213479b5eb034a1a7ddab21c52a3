 I could sit at home and cry or keep my head up and maintain a positive attitude, were the words of exiled Ajax Amsterdam midfielder Thulani Serero as he contemplates a move away from the club where he has been frozen for five months. The want-away midfielder is set for a January transfer to either France or England. Serero played a match for the Ajax junior team recently, having been omitted from Peter Bosz s first team squad. But instead of wallowing in misery, Serero knuckled down and refused to drop his head. I am a very strong person. I can handle myself and look in the mirror because I ve always been good for everyone at Ajax and have always given everything, Serero said. The worst thing for me was not being on the pitch on match-day. That caused me a lot of pain. Speaking to the Dutch media, Serero also opened up about his ordeal on the sidelines for the past few months. He also revealed English Championship side Reading and French Ligue 1 side Bordeaux had shown interest.In fact, Serero had an opportunity to move to Cyprus after APOEL FC had shown interest on the last day of the previous transfer period. But he admitted he couldn t make a rushed decision without due consideration. Reading, Bordeaux and some other clubs have expressed an interest in me. That Jaap Stam showed interest in me says a lot. That interest makes me feel good and gives me more energy which I need now. The interest of APOEL came too late. It was the last day of the transfer window and I did not know much about the league or APOEL. I had not even spoken to APOEL so there was still far to go to reach an agreement. There were also many other options but my gut said no. Despite not being active for his club, Serero has made two appearances for Bafana, scoring against Senegal in their 2018 World Cup qualifier last month. His contract expires at the end of the season, but Serero might not wait until then to leave the Dutch giants.kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za-Kgomotso Sethusha
