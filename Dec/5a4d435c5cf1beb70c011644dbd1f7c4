With Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba facing the possible sack today, Eric Tinkler has emerged as one of the local coaches tipped to replace him.Tinkler is a Bafana legend, who has carved a career as a coach who could win on the continent after he once guided Orlando Pirates to the CAF Confederation Cup, having also served as an assistant coach when the Buccaneers reached the CAF Champions League.This is not to mention a winning start to life he has enjoyed at Cape Town City, the team he has already led to the top-eight cup semifinal and now the Telkom Knockout final.The newly-formed franchise could win its first major trophy and Tinkler s first after he fell at the Nedbank Cup final hurdle with Bucs last season.Safa have expressed interest in getting a local coach with a proven record on the continent for Bafana in future.Federations around the world have been giving opportunities to local players without winning records and Safa could be looking to follow the route of England, who yesterday announced Gareth Southgate as the national team coach. Tinkler has not ruled himself out of a possible comeback to the national team.However, the only snag for Safa could be that the 46 year old is not interested in the job as yet.Despite his record in the PSL and in Africa, Tinkler believes he has not done enough to lead the national team. I am still looking to grow as a coach, and looking to achieve things as a coach, Tinkler said. The 1996 Africa Cup of Nations winner said he felt it was not fair to talk about the job as it still belonged to Mashaba, pending a disciplinary hearing. And besides that, with all due respect Bafana Bafana still have a coach, Tinkler said. I think there should be an ethos and a bit of ethics among us as coaches not to talk things like that. Mashaba is due to appear before the Safa disciplinary hearing today to face several charges, including that of displaying disrespectful behaviour to Safa president Danny Jordaan recently.In fact, Mashaba could be shown the door before the end of the week if he is found guilty on the charges brought against him by his employers.That will mean Safa will have to find a replacement to oversee the rest of the World Cup qualification campaign.Tinkler is not the only coach linked with the job as the names of Gavin Hunt, Pitso Mosimane, Stuart Baxter and Ruud Krol have also been bandied about.SITHEMBISO DINDIsithembisod@thenewage.co.za
