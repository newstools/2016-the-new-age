The Reconciliation Day Colour Festival at the Carnival City Casino, East Rand, tonight will see the likes of Kwesta, Major League, DJ Dimplez, DJ Zan-D, DJ Kent and many others provide fire and entertainment to give music lovers a dazzling welcome to the festive season. Sama award-winning rapper, Kwesta real name Senzo Mfundo Vilakazi has promised fans a great time as he delivers smashing hits that will include Ngudu and Nomayini, among others. He performs with a live band and is all worked up to give a sterling show. The good thing about performing with a live band is that the fans get to experience you differently while for me, as the performing artist, I get to interpret music on a different level. So we are going to be jamming and vibing together on stage. It will be an amazing experience, the East Rand-born rapper said. Kwesta has been one of the most consistent rappers in the country. His smash hit, Ngudu, has dominated airwaves on radio and television. I cannot attribute the success to myself. I think the songs owe their success to the fact that they speak the language of the people and many can relate to the experiences reflected in my music. &nbsp;More than anything, I would like to thank the fans for their support and for responding the way they have to my music, Kwesta said With the year soon coming to an end, the rapper promised his fans more of the same in the new year. It is all about music for me. I have been in the studio for the better part of the year, so there is going to be more music in the new year. Then there is also my clothing line, RapyLyf Apparel, as well as new group TLT that I will be launching under my own record label Rap Life Records, he said. Known on social media as DaKingofAfricanRap, the multi-award winning rapper recently launched a clothing label and has encouraged young fashion designers to contribute their creative juices to the range. &nbsp; siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
