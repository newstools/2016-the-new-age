A NEW framework to shape South Africa s future approach to the teaching and resourcing of mathematics is expected to be finalised by December next year.A team of experts in mathematics, science and technology will have the next 12 months to come up with a way forward following a three-day imbizo hosted by the Department of Basic Education. Department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said: The indaba was a huge success, with a draft framework that will shape the approaches to the teaching and resourcing of mathematics education as the key product coming out of three days of hard and focused work. The team of experts will work in consultation with other key stakeholders in carrying this task forward. The minister has given the team 12 months to complete this work and to present the final Mathematics Framework in December 2017. Experts from industry, academia, non-government organisations, the basic education sector and other government departments attended the indaba. Mhlanga said the experts reflected on the landscape of mathematics education in the basic education sector and spent time looking at how other countries, internationally and regionally, succeed in the teaching and learning of mathematics to achieve good learning outcomes.Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga called for the overhaul of the education system in South Africa to address the poor performance of pupils. According to the Trends in International Maths and Science Study released last month, South Africa is ranked second last out of 48 countries for Grade 4 mathematics, second last for Grade 8 mathematics and last for Grade 8 science out of 38 countries. The top performing country in terms of mathematics was Singapore.snn4@thenewage.co.za-Lilian Selapisa&nbsp;
