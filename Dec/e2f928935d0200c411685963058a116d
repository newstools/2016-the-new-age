The third annual Countdown Music Festival is ready to usher the people of East London into 2017 in a safe and jolly mood.Boasting a star studded line-up of musicians including Nathi, Zonke, Vusi Nova, Ntando, Ray Phiri and Emtee, the two days are scheduled to take place on December 31 and January 1 at Buffalo City Stadium in East London.Events organiser Lindelwa Nkete said the concept of the festival is to discover raw talent from the Eastern Cape, and also provide an opportunity for upcoming musicians to network and build relationships with already established artists.The concept does not only focus on entertainment, but also inspires economic growth for the province through job creation. Festive Season is fun, easy, family time. At Countdown Music Festival we take that seriously as we usher our beautiful people of the Eastern Cape into a new year, Nkete said. When we started the concept the initial idea was to unearth raw talent of the Eastern Cape and create a platform where they could network with national artists without having to leave the province. But we are happy that in the process we were able to create employment for our youth and small businesses while building our reputation as a tourism destination of choice during this busy period of the year, she said.The two-day festival has grown from being a one-day affair to meet the people s demands, Nkete said. This decision was the result of high demand from our festival-goers and loyalists who wanted to stay on while enjoying our east coast beaches. Nathi Mankayi, who will be making his d but at the festival, said he s looking forward to going back home for a good jol. I have never performed at the Countdown Music Festival, so I am extremely excited because East London is also my home and as you know there s no place like home, Mankayi said.NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
