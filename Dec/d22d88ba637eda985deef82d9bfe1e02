THE Eyethu Lifestyle Centre and the Soweto Theatre transformed into a book carnival at the weekend as authors and book enthusiasts gathered to celebrate and inculcate the culture of reading among blacks.The book festival was the first of its kind and focused on black writers and readers. The theme, Our Stories, was meant to celebrate African stories told through the written and spoken word, visual arts, music and film.The festival explored ways in which local stories were told, and how they reflected the day-to-day lived experiences. Workshops were conducted on film screenings. There were intimate conversations by writers and performing artists on what needed to be done to encourage the culture of reading.Participants included Angela Makholwa, Bheki Peterson, Bongani Madondo, Bontle Senne, Chika Unigwe, Dikeledi Deekay Sibanda, Duduzile Zamantungwa Mabaso, Don Mattera, Elinor Sisulu, Eusebius McKaiser, Florence Masebe, Fred Khumalo, Gcina Mhlope, Lebo Mashile and Thandiswa Mazwai.Festival curator Panashe Chigumadzi was impressed and said participants included depth and variety . Some of our authors have been telling stories for as long as others have been alive, while others have just begun, but are bringing incredible innovations to the art.We look forward to a great future, she said. She said that the significance of the festival for the South African and African literary landscape cannot be overemphasised and that it was important to hold it in Soweto, the country s artistic and cultural melting pot 40 years after the June 16, 1976 uprisings.KUTULLO MADISHA&nbsp;
