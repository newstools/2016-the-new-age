Women s representation in local government increased from 39% in 2011 to 41% in the 2016 local government elections in August but the increase fell short of South Africa s regional and international commitments to gender equality.The South African Local Government Association (Salga), in partnership with Gender Links, the EU, the Commission for Gender Equality, SA Women In Dialogue, and UN Women, launched the SA Gender and Local Government Election Report this week.The launch event was attended by former IEC chairperson Dr Brigalia Bam, gender experts, activists and political parties . Having emerged from a successful Salga 2016 national conference and as alluded to in the Johannesburg declaration, Salga has noted with concern failure to achieve the 50:50 representation of women in the local government sector, saidSalga spokesperson Tahir Sema. He said Salga was concerned by the failure to address gender equality issues despite the call for equality of representation, particularly at ward level.The association called for all political parties to respect and advance the goal of gender equality in government.Sema said Salga had committed itself to achieving gender equality through its new strategy for 2017-2022, which was adopted at the 2016 Salga national conference. South Africa is a signatory of several UN conventions that were created to remove barriers that are faced by women. The government initiated a number of reforms aimed at ensuring greater participation of women in politics and to support the 1996 constitution that entrenches gender equality as a fundamental human right, he said.Salga is commemorating the 16 Days of Activism for no violence against women and children in partnership with Gender Links, the Commission for Gender Equality, South African Women in Dialogue, the EU, and UN Women.In this regard, parallel launch events will take place during the 16 Days of Activism in order to lobby and advocate for multiple strategic efforts to empower women and end gender-based violence in South Africa.ntombin@thenewage.co.za
