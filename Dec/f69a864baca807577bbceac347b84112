Despite the resignation of Prof Mbulaheni Maguvhe the parliamentary inquiry into the SABC board he had led continues with two former chairpersons scheduled to give evidence next month.Maguvhe stepped down as the last remaining board member earlier this week.Vincent Smith, chairperson of the ad hoc committee that has been investigating the fitness of the board to remain in office, said Maguvhe s departure did not mean the end of the inquiry. Our mandate is a mandate from the National Assembly. The committee will continue with its work. It is business as usual. We will carry on with our work, he said.He confirmed that two former chairpersons of the SABC board, Dr Ben Ngubane and Ellen Thsabalala, are due to give evidence when the ad hoc committee resumes its inquiry on January 10. Then we ll have to finalise a preliminary report and send it to all parties, Smith said.He was confident that the ad hoc committee would have its report ready for the deadline of February 28 next year as set by the National Assembly. We are determined to meet our deadline. Meanwhile, the chairperson of Parliament s communications portfolio committee Humphrey Maxegwana said the oversight committee would meet on January 24. It will be part of our normal programme. On the way forward for the SABC, he said legally the portfolio committee would have to recommend a group to serve as an interim board to Parliament.Once approved by the National Assembly these names will be submitted to President Jacob Zuma who will appoint nominees to serve for six months.He said he was certain that political parties were already looking at candidates for an Interim SABC board. We ll have to see in January. The ball is in Parliament s court, Maxegwana said.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
