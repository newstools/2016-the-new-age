South Africa has been ranked as the fourth most entrepreneurial African country this year by the Ashish Thakkar Global Entrepreneurship Index.The index is run by 30-year-old businessman Ashish Thakkar through his Mara Foundation. Thakkar began his entrepreneurial journey more than 15 years ago as a high school student in Uganda where he sold computers to his schoolmates and friends. That small trading operation snowballed into the Mara Group, a diversified conglomerate with about $100m (R1.4bn) in revenue.The index based its decision on five pillars representing the barriers faced by entrepreneurs. These are poor infrastructure, government policies, education, finance, and the entrepreneurial environment.Namibia was ranked the most entrepreneurial African country this year. South Africa s neighbour was ranked 42 out of 85 global countries in the study.Namibia narrowly beat out Rwanda, Botswana and South Africa, which were ranked 43, 44, and 46 respectively.The study said: The rank was based on five pillars representing the barriers faced by entrepreneurs. These are poor infrastructure, government policies, education, finance, and the entrepreneurial environment. Other African countries also score highly on certain pillars, including Zambia, which is the highest ranked African country in finance with a rank of 72. Ethiopia s entrepreneurial environment is ranked 59th, while Tunisia is ranked 58 in education.Despite the current ranking small business activity in the country has grown in line with the country s gross domestic product, which almost tripled from $143.8bn in 1996 to $404.3bn in 2011.For small businesses the gains have been all the more impressive given that before democracy a myriad restrictions, laws and by-laws prevented black entrepreneurs from entering the business world.South Africa s ranking is a stark contrast of what was happening two years ago when it received international praise.In 2015, renowned international businessman Rich Benton lauded SA s emerging entrepreneurs as being among the best in the world .Benton, one of the founding directors of the UK s Capita Group and chair of the Global Social Entrepreneur Network at the time advised SA to groom budding business brains in their formative years.His assessment at the time seemed not very far off as the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2014 report, which showed that in 2001, 19.7% of the country s adult population saw opportunities to start a business, while this figure rose to 37% last year.SAMUEL MUNGADZEsamuelm@thenewage.co.za
