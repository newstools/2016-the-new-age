WHILE Joseph Molangoane might finally be free to join Kaizer Chiefs, Keagan Dolly will have to wait until next week to find out the outcome of his contractual dispute with Mamelodi Sundowns. Molangoane has been embroiled in a contractual dispute with Chippa United since the off season when he signed for Kaizer .The Port Elizabeth side argued that he still had two years left on his contract and therefore could not transfer to any club without them receiving payment. The attacking midfielder took Chippa to the PSL s dispute resolution chamber (DRC) in a bid to get his clearance. Initially the DRC ruled in Chippa s favour but it has emerged that after some degree of conciliation between the two parties, Molangoane has been allowed to join the team of his choice.When the season kicked off, Molongoane decided to stay away and kept fit at an academy in Gauteng Meanwhile, Dolly s legal team and Sundowns are waiting on the outcome of the PSL after both parties presented their written submissions before the DRC. The bone of contention is Dolly s buyout clause, which Sundowns dispute.The Bafana Bafana star s agency was angry when Sundowns turned down an offer from Greek side Olympiacos. They were of the view of that the attacking midfielder would be released as per the buyout clause. The SA Football Players Union, which Dolly s agency turned to for assistance, issued an update yesterday. We have just come out of the DRC with Paul Mitchell (Dolly s manager) together with Ramon Dolly (Dolly s father) and our legal team. We are waiting for written submissions before December 9 by both parties. Once those submissions are made we will get the ruling from the PSL. Within seven to 14 days they will make their verdict, the union said.news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
