Lawyers representing Oakbay Investments say they are open to negotiations with the EFF before a court order to attach the party s assets is implemented early next year.Yesterday, the North Gauteng High Court granted Oakbay permission to attach assets worth R180 000 that the party owed in legal costs.The court order stems from an application for an interdict to stop EFF leader Julius Malema from making any threats against the company and its employees early this year.Malema made the threats at a press conference where he said The New Age and ANN7 journalists were no longer allowed to cover his party s events and if they did, their safety would not be guaranteed.Oakbay was granted the interdict and the EFF was ordered to pay the legal costs for both the initial application and again when it attempted to appeal the interdict.Dudu Dube
