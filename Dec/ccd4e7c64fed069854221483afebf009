Santa Claus came early for the 250 elderly people, including 105-year-old granny Thembeni Mchunu of MooiMpofana, who were showered with gifts by their mayor, Xolani Duma.According to Duma, the day of the elderly is a chance for them as the municipality to recognise the role that the elderly play in their communities. Many of the elderly do not get a chance throughout the year to rejoice as they often have huge responsibilities which are placed on their shoulders because of the rampant social ills that are destroying many young lives in communities, Duma said. Also the state of the economy is such that many elderly find themselves having to support their families from their grants as their children and grandchildren don t have jobs. His generous gesture brought tears to the eyes of Thembeni, who received a fridge, a microwave and groceries. Other grannies and grandpas also received food vouchers and appliances which were sponsored by the local business community. We owe this democracy to these senior citizens of our municipality. This is a generation that sacrificed a lot and we cannot have joy until they live a joyful life where their dignity is restored to the fullest, Duma said.He said the new leadership of MooiMpofana would embark on various programmes to improve the lives of the underprivileged, including senior citizens. As the new council of MooiMpofana municipality we will not rest until we have built enough houses for the needy and provided them with fresh water and dignified sanitation. We are vowing to nip the scourge of abuse of the elderly in the bud. No one is going to suppress the freedom of our senior citizens in a free and democratic country they gave birth to through sweat and blood, he said.NOKUTHULA NTULI
