The former party chief of Nanjing city has been sentenced to more than 12 years in prison for accepting bribes, a Chinese court said Wednesday, two years after he was sacked amid a national crackdown on corruption.Yang Weize received a 12 and a half year sentence for taking over 16 million yuan ($2.3 million) as head of the eastern city&#8217;s Communist Party office as well as other positions in Jiangsu province, a statement from the Ningbo Intermediate People&#8217;s Court said.He was first probed by the ruling party&#8217;s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection in January 2015 and was later sacked from his position.The investigation came as leader Xi Jinping launched a much-publicised drive against corruption after he came to power in 2014, vowing to target both high-level &#8220;tigers&#8221; and low-ranking &#8220;flies&#8221;.The court also confiscated two million yuan from Yang besides taking back the illegal gains he made, the statement said.-AFP
