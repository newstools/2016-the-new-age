New York Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was fined $12,154 by the NFL on Friday for verbal abuse and excessive profanity directed toward an official.The fine is at least the fifth of the season for the controversial player, who reportedly confronted an official on the field after the Giants&#8217; 24-14 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers last Sunday.Beckham was irked in the first quarter after being called for offensive pass interference and sharply criticized officiating after the game. &#8220;I don&#8217;t pay attention to nonsense. It was a horrible call in my opinion,&#8221; Beckham said.AFP
