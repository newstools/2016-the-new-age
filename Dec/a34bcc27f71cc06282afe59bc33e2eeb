The Waikato Chiefs on Wednesday named Colin Cooper as coach Dave Rennie&#8217;s successor at the New Zealand Super Rugby team.The Chiefs said Cooper had signed a three-year deal and would take over in 2018, a few months after Rennie is scheduled to depart for the Glasgow Warriors.Cooper, 57, currently coaches the Maori All Blacks and was in charge of the Wellington Hurricanes from 2003-2010.&#8220;To be involved in coaching Super Rugby again within the ambitious and innovative setup at the Chiefs is exciting,&#8221; he said in a statement.Wales coach Warren Gatland, a Waikato native, revealed this week that he had been approached about taking the job but declined as he is under contract until 2019.Reports in New Zealand said Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, another Kiwi, also turned down the role for similar reasons.AFP
