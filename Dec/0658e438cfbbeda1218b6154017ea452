I oppose it wherever it rears its head. Helen Zille (@helenzille) December 21, 2016@helenzille to me it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;rears its head&#8221;. Its a daily fight. You doing that is white privilege, which u deny exists. memoirs of an eyesha (@spookybulb) December 21, 2016@Nndoweni @RanjeniM @Our_DA You obviously have never read our policies. And I devote 2 chapters in my book to the subject.

Procedures are being put in place to ensure that this does not happen again. No offence was intended and we are sorry that Mr Maqetuka had this experience.&#8221;Zillle is no stranger to provoking the ire of Twitter users with some of her comments.Many saw a tweet by Zille mere hours after the 2016 Municipal election polls closed, calling for the funding of a group of University of Cape Town students involved in the #FeesMustFalL to be revoked, as lacking empathy for their plight.The group had written in the Cape Argus about the political environment in the country and their discontent with local government as well as experience at UCT.Despite much criticism of her remarks, in trademark Zille style, she defended her stance.Back in 2011 she famously engaged in Twitter beef with musician Simphiwe Dana whom she referred to as a &#8220;professional black&#8221; during a Twitter debate over racism in Cape Town.&#8220;You&#8217;re a highly respected black professional. Don&#8217;t try to be a professional black. It demeans you,&#8221; tweeted Zille to Dana.Asked to define what a professional black was Zille responded, &#8220;People who base their life and purpose around their colour.&#8221;Zille was also previously criticised for a tweet where she referred to Eastern Cape pupils who relocated to the Western Cape for a better education as &#8220;refugees.&#8221;TNA Reporter
