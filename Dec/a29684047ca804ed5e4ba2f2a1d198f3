Success and controversy seems to follow the new kid on the block, Bongekile Simelane, popularly known as Babes Wodumo.The Mercedes hit maker was criticised by certain government officials for promoting drugs on the track.At the weekend, the dancer/singer from Durban was forced to apologise to her fans after giving a below-par performance at the Buyel Ekhaya Pan African music festival in East London.In her defence, Babes Wodumo took to Instagram where she posted a video message claiming Hlubi Mazwai, the festival promoter, had verbally abused and threatened to kill her, which affected her performance on December 18.However, Mazwai rubbished the claims on Facebook, where she claims the 23-year-old singer arrived late and refused to perform even after arrangements had been made for her to perform in the early hours of the morning. Buyel Ekhaya rejects with contempt the allegations placed by artist Babes Wodumo against Mrs Hlubi Mazwai, the founder and festival director of the Buyel Ekhaya Pan African Music Festival.The video Babes Wodumo has uploaded on social media is an attempt to mislead the public through misrepresentation of the facts, aimed at discrediting the Buyel Ekhaya brand. This is an ill conceived attempt to justify her poor performance, as well as her ill-discipline and undermining of festivalgoers and people of the Eastern Cape, Mazwai said.While that skirmish was going on, the organiser made slip of the Babes R100000 performance fee which subsequently dominated social media with many arguing the amount was too much for a newcomer such as Babes Wodumo.There were those who differed, citing jaded American artists. Washed up Americans come and charge millions, Bongani Mtolo tweeted.SIYABONGA SITHOLE
