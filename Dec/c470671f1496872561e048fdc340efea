Indian investigators arrested a central bank official Tuesday for allegedly illegally exchanging old bills worth some 15 million rupees ($222,000) for new ones as the country faces a cash crisis.The arrest comes at a time when many Indians are struggling to find the cash to buy food following the government&#8217;s shock move last month to withdraw high-denomination 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes from circulation in a bid to tackle tax evasion.India&#8217;s Central Bureau of Investigation arrested K. Michael, an official at the Reserve Bank of India, in the southern city of Bangalore after they found him working with a state bank employee to convert old banknotes without legal documentation.&#8220;K. Michael&#8230; has been arrested for his alleged involvement in converting old 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee notes worth 15 million rupees into 100 rupee notes,&#8221; a CBI official told AFP on the condition of anonymity.Investigators also found him hoarding 16 million rupees in new 500 and 2,000 rupee banknotes.The RBI said Michael was a junior official and had been suspended.&#8220;The concerned employee has been suspended,&#8221; SS Mundra, an RBI deputy governor, told reporters.&#8220;We have instituted investigation and due action will be taken once the details are known.&#8221;The CBI has also registered criminal cases of cheating against several public and private bank employees.Seven middlemen in Bangalore were also arrested for &#8220;converting unaccounted cash&#8221; and more than nine million rupees were recovered, an official told AFP.Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashed chaos with his bombshell move to pull the high-value notes, triggering long queues outside banks and ATMs which have been running dry as thousands throng to them.The sweeping abolition was meant to bring billions in so-called &#8220;black&#8221;, or undeclared, money back into the formal system, the government says.-AFP
