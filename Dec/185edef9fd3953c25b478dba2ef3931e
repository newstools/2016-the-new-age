South African batting superstar AB de Villiers will play for the Titans during their CSA T20 Challenge clash against the Warriors at Buffalo Park in East London on Sunday.The Titans host the Highveld Lions in the eagerly anticipated Jukskei Derby tomorrow afternoon at SuperSport Park in Centurion, but franchise chief executive Jacques Faul yesterday said De Villiers would probably not feature in that match. We have him for the match against the Warriors in East London and it is highly unlikely that he will play against the Lions, Faul said. The coach may decide otherwise but it is highly unlikely that he will play on Wednesday. However, fast bowler Morn Morkel, who returned from the tour to Australia without playing, is expected to feature against the Lions and the Warriors after he was rested following a lower-back strain. De Villiers, who is the Proteas Test and ODI captain, has been out of action since he injured his elbow during the Caribbean Premier League in July.As a result of the injury, he missed the once-off ODI against Ireland, the Test series against New Zealand and both the ODI and Test series against Australia, all of which South Africa won under the leadership of Faf du Plessis.De Villiers availability is a huge boost for the Titans who will be looking to return to winning ways after two successive losses to the Dolphins and Warriors last week, which saw their lead at the top of the log reduced to one point. Mark Boucher s men need to win their remaining two matches against the Lions and Warriors this week to ensure a home final later in the month when they will have the opportunity to defend their title.De Villiers involvement with the Titans will also be good news for Proteas coach Russell Domingo and the selectors as they are hoping to have him ready for the upcoming three-match series against Sri Lanka, which starts with the Boxing Day Test in Port Elizabeth.De Villiers is expected to assume his captaincy duties for the Proteas against Sri Lanka despite the fact that Du Plessis covered himself in glory during series victories against New Zealand and Australia.&nbsp;Mahlatse Mphahlele| mahlatsem@thenewage.co.za
