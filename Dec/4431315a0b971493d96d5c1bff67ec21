Former England soccer captain David Beckham said he was surprised and proud that his 11-year-old son, Cruz, had taken it upon himself to raise money for charity by releasing a Christmas single.Cruz Beckham followed in the musical footsteps of his mum, fashion designer and former Spice Girl Victoria, by releasing &#8220;If Everyday Was Christmas&#8221; last week, with all proceeds from the single going to British children&#8217;s charity , Make Some Noise.&#8220;He&#8217;s been listening to his dad and his mum and saying how important it is to help others,&#8221; David Beckham , a United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) ambassador, said in New York on Monday at a 70th anniversary celebration for the charity .&#8220;I was quite amazed by that because he&#8217;s 11 years old and to realise how important it is to give back at that age is something special.&#8221;David Beckham was joined at the UNICEF celebration, held at the United Nations headquarters, by actors Jackie Chan, Orlando Bloom and Priyanka Chopra.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9DSZscjoUk-Reuters
