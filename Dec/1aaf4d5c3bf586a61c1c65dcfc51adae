More than 15 people have drowned in the country since the beginning of December, and this number is expected to rise as thousands travel to the coast to cool off during the festive season.Last festive season, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) recorded 22 fatal drownings, which included eight children.On Tuesday, a two-year-old girl was playing next to the pool at her Pietermaritzburg home when she fell in.Paramedics said when they arrived at the scene the girl showed no signs of life and was declared dead at the scene.In another incident, two paddlers found the a body of a man in a life jacket floating next to a capsized boat in Zeekoevlei Lake near Grassy Park on Sunday.Last Friday, KwaZulu-Natal police said the body of a nine-year-old boy was recovered at a river in KwaMashu in Durban. Police believe he was swept away by the river due to heavy rain in the province last Thursday.On December 3, a 36-year-old pastor drowned in Umlazi River in front of congregants while apparently conducting a baptism.The drownings have prompted the NSRI and Lifesaving SA to work with rescue services in an effort to reduce the number of drownings in South Africa this summer season.NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said they had compiled safety rules for beachgoers, as well as rules for those with pools in their complexes and yards. Only swim at beaches where and when lifeguards are on duty. Swim only between the red and yellow flags. Don t drink alcohol and swim. Don t swim alone. Ensure children are supervised by competent adults and install barriers which prevent unsupervised access to water. Don t attempt a rescue, rather call a lifeguard, he said.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
