Former ambassador and journalist John Qwelane will stand trial in March despite his ill health that has delayed his case for months.Yesterday the Constitutional Court found that an indefinite postponement granted to him by the high court in August was a miscarriage of justice because the two parties that brought a case of hate speech against him were not given a chance to oppose.In 2008 Qwelane wrote a column in the Sunday Sun newspaper headlined, Call me names but gay is not okay .In the article he compared homosexual people to animals.This led to the South African Human Rights Commission taking him to the Equality Court where he was found guilty and ordered to pay R100000 to a gay rights organisation.The matter was transferred to the South Gauteng High Court and was, after eight years, to be heard in August.Qwelane applied for a postponement as he was chronically ill, so much so that he depends on artificially supplied oxygen on a daily basis.The high court granted him a postponement without hearing argument from the Human Rights Commission and Psychological Society of SA.Although the ConCourt said it could not interfere in the case because a new trial date had already been set, it found that the high court erred. This was that receiving answering affidavits from the two opposing would have made no difference to the result. That was wrong. It is trite that at common law and in terms of the tenets of natural justice, hearing the other party, audi alteram partem, is an indispensable condition of fair proceedings, the court said.In his application for a postponement, Qwelane argued that a trial in his state would violate his dignity and privacy.However, the organisations argued the LGBTI community deserved justice as they had been hurt and degraded and their constitutional rights violated by Qwelane s published remarks.dudud@thenewage.co.zaDudu Dube
