State-owned freight and logistics company Transnet is celebrating the graduation of 81 Port Elizabeth-based graduates out of a record 513 national graduates who recently completed their qualifications in various aspects of port and marine operations as the company intensifies its training efforts to meet its developmental objectives.The graduates completed internationally-recognised qualifications through Transnet s specialised academy for marine and port operations skills, including marine pilots, tug masters, engineers and lifting operators.The celebratory event, which took place at the Boardwalk in Port Elizabeth and hosted by Transnet group chief executive Siyabonga Gama, is the last of three graduation ceremonies held at various cities where Transnet conducts the training. This year marks the highest number of graduates since the first intake in 2013. We are no longer going to send people to the Netherlands for training. We are training people for our economy and we are contributing towards national skills development and job creation, Gama said.Prior to the graduation Transnet held a tugboat display for the media at the Port Elizabeth harbour where Gama said Transnet has committed R7bn towards skills development and training.Since 2012 it has already provided some R60m in training. Transnet s Maritime School of Excellence offers sector-specific training in marine operations, terminal operations, port management, port engineering and other specialised training for Transnet s ports operating divisions Transnet Port Terminals and Transnet National Ports Authority.It has a main campus in Durban and three satellite campuses in Richards Bay, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth.The school s programmes are aligned with the company s 10-year rolling infrastructure investment programme, the market demand strategy (MDS) and the business requirements of Transnet s customers.Two hundred and ten trainees have graduated from the programme since its launch three years ago.The majority of the graduates have been absorbed into Transnet s various marine and port operations throughout the country.The Maritime School of Excellence was established in 2013 to address the shortages of technical skills in the maritime sector and to respond to the broader challenge of addressing critical skills shortages required to stimulate economic growth, job creation and overall improvement of the quality of life for all.The school is a merger between the School of Port Terminals and the School of Ports for effective delivery of integrated maritime training primarily for Transnet and for the country. The company trains beyond its business requirements in support of government initiatives to address the challenges of skills shortages and mismatches which were identified as the main obstacles to job creation and economic growth. Transnet s training programmes are designed to produce a pool of skilled individuals who can compete with the best globally, Gama said.He said over the last few years Transnet had trained students from Malawi, Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, positioning itself as a premier provider of marine training programmes.provinces@thenewage.co.za
