More than 50 elders from Heidedal, near Bloemfontein, sew clothes and blankets to sell at pension grant pay points and other areas in Mangaung.They then take a certain percentage of the cash and make a donation to orphanages, saying that it takes a community to raise a child.The senior citizens said they do not want to rely only on pension grants.A retired nurse, Ester Felix, instructs them on the best articles to produce and the ideal target market.The senior citizens began nine years ago operating from a crowded container. They manage to work on a daily basis and start their day with exercises.The 62-year-old former nurse said when she retired two years ago she decided to connect to the senior citizens and teach them to improve their skills. I registered our company at the social development department so that we can be recognised and get the support when facing difficulties. The business is doing well, we sell our stuff at pay points, malls and in towns, Felix said.She said at the end of every month all the workers donate R30 to buy materials because they do not have any sponsor as yet. The donation is helping us a lot and the money we make we can also buy food and go on holiday to Durban or any other place to enjoy ourselves. Once a month I check their high blood pressure and sugar and I make sure they don t drink any medication on an empty stomach or at an incorrect time, Felix said. She said her wish is to get enough working space to accommodate more elders who want to join them.Elizabeth Mahlatsi, 76, who is a co-founder, said they were nine when they started and now they are 50.She said their aim was to keep elders busy. We were exercising and doing sewing for fun but when Felix joined us she taught to work on blankets and to design woollen bags. Now we are more developed and this is a challenge to our youth that if elders can do it, why can t they do it? We are using our own hands to help ourselves and the community, Mahlatsi said.BECKER SEMELA
