US President Barack Obama declared Friday that Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s Syrian regime and its Iranian and Russian backers are responsible for the slaughter of civilians in Aleppo, with &#8220;blood&#8230; on their hands.&#8221;&#8220;The world as we speak is united in horror at the savage assault by the Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies on the city of Aleppo,&#8221; he told an end-of-year news conference.&#8220;This blood and these atrocities are on their hands,&#8221; he said, before admitting to reporters that he also asks himself whether the United States has done enough to halt the war.&#8220;There are places around the world where horrible things are happening and &#8212; because of my office, because I&#8217;m president of the United States &#8212; I feel responsible,&#8221; he said.&#8220;Is there something I could do that would save lives and make a difference and spare some child who doesn&#8217;t deserve to suffer? So that&#8217;s a starting point.&#8221;The US leader, who leaves office on January 20 to make way for President-elect Donald Trump, called for impartial observers to deploy to monitor efforts to evacuate civilians from the city.And he warned Assad, who has been engaged in a brutal civil war against rebel forces since 2011, that he will not be able to &#8220;slaughter his way to legitimacy.&#8221;&#8211; &#8216;Synonym for hell&#8217; &#8211;Obama&#8217;s White House has been engaged in a diplomatic effort to convince Russia to bring Assad to the table to negotiate a peace deal with the Syrian opposition.But all attempts to broker a ceasefire have rapidly broken down, and now Russia is working with Turkey to oversee an evacuation of the last rebel-held pocket of Aleppo.On Friday, the Syrian government suspended that operation, trapping thousands of civilians and rebel fighters in the city and increasing fears of a bloodbath to come.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned that Aleppo had become &#8220;a synonym for hell&#8221; and urged &#8220;the parties to take all necessary measures to allow safe resumption of this evacuation process.&#8221;Senior US officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry and Washington&#8217;s ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, have warned Assad against carrying out a Srebrenica-style massacre.They have also warned the defeat of Aleppo will not end the civil war but instead foment extremism among Assad&#8217;s opponents and have called for war crimes investigations.&#8211; &#8216;Right approach&#8217; &#8211;But Washington has not been able to mediate the start of a credible peace process, nor separate so-called &#8220;moderate rebels&#8221; from Al Qaeda-linked extremists.&#8220;I cannot claim that we&#8217;ve been successful and so that&#8217;s something that, as is true with a lot of issues and problems around the world I have to go to bed with every night,&#8221; Obama said.&#8220;But I continue to believe it was the right approach given what realistically we could get done.&#8221;More than 310,000 people have been killed since early 2011, when Assad brutally repressed anti-government protests and provoked a civil war.More than half the population has been displaced, with millions becoming refugees, placing a huge burden on neighboring countries and sparking a political crisis in Europe.Meanwhile, the extremist Islamic State jihadist group has taken advantage of the chaos to seize part of eastern Syria and set up a &#8220;capital&#8221; in the city of Raqa.US troops and warplanes are helping locally recruited militias fight the Islamic State in the east, but have not intervened against Assad, who has Russian military backing.-AFP
