THE storm over the decision to condone grade seven to nine pupils who did not meet the 40% requirement for mathematics is not necessary as it was only a short-term solution and only for those who met all the other requirements to proceed to the next grade, according to the Department of Basic Education (DBE).According to the department, there was no such things as a 20% pass mark for mathematics and there had been no change in the progression policy to reflect this, but that it is in the process of reviewing its progression policies.Last week the department released a circular on the special condonation dispensation for senior phase learners in mathematics , which allowed pupils to progress but only if they passed both language subjects, obtaining a minimum of 50% in one of them.According to the curriculum policy, CAPS, even if a pupil passes all their other subjects but gets less than 40% for mathematics, they fail the year. We are all aware that not everyone is mathematically inclined. Some people are more inclined towards the arts, others are better with technical subjects, making this policy unfair to those who are forced to take mathematics but are not good at it, department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said.Mhlanga said it was decided that while the policy was under review, pupils who had passed all the other subjects except for mathematics should be allowed to proceed to the next grade. This decision is only applicable to senior phase learners and only applicable for 2016 while we are at this point of policy review, he said.Western Cape education MEC Debbie Sch fer was among those who criticised the move by the department, saying it was simply putting a band aid on a patient in ICU and would result in the death of the economy if nothing was done to fix it. It does not help trying to aim for better marks by trying to increase the pass percentage through condoning failure. The department achieves the higher pass percentage, but the pass criteria is 10% below what it was before, she said.-LILLIAN SELAPISA
