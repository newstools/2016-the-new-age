Scripted endings to careers are rare in sports, but netball star Rahab Ngobeni ended her career with a remarkable flourish as a goal shooter for the provincial side, the Baobabs.Too often great players hobble into retirement on the arm of a physiotherapist, or a quick pre-emptive press conference to avoid the indignity of being dropped.Those who make it to the field that one last time are often overpowered by the occasion, knowing there will not be another chance and invariably disappoint.The standing ovation they receive is a retrospective one, substituting that day s fumbling with a decade of remembered splendour.But Ngobeni, who announced quietly that she was retiring from the ailing Baobabs, has always written her own script. Granted, her plots have been somewhat repetitive and too much to garner the acclaim of aesthetes.But she has acted with unmatched intensity, skill and attention to detail. In some quarters, Ngobeni, who retires at the age of 30, was as immovable and immortal as the traditions of domestic netball.During the 2016 Brutal Fruit Premier Netball League the public watched her in admiration and frustration as she dominated proceedings in games.During the squad selection process ahead of the league, Ngobeni was conspicuous by her absence, but coach Cecilia Molokwane drafted her nonetheless.The towering presence at 2.1m tall was supposed to inspire confidence and also provide the catalyst for comprehensive match-winning.Invaluable to Limpopo s new generation of goal shooters, Ngobeni has kept herself one step ahead.MOYAHABO MABEBA
