While many remain sceptical about the impact of youth camps in the lives of young people, organisers say the camps are definitely making a positive impact and benefiting the lives of the youth.The camps are hosted annually by the national Department of Social Development in partnership with the Department of Defence and Military Veterans, the Director Youth Mobilisation and Development Support.Speaking at the fifth national youth camp at the 3 South African Infantry Battalion base in Kimberley, the northern director of the department of social development Zonke Noncedo described the youth camp, which they started in 2012, as a programme aimed at promoting national identity, nation building, social cohesion, patriotism and active citizenry among young people of SouthAfrica. The South African government recognises the challenges associated with adolescents and youth and is committed to continue prioritising investments aimed at equipping and developing young people. As such, during the youth camp young people will participate in discussions around the many challenges they face, including living without parents (child-headed households), access to education and skills training, unemployment, alcohol and substance abuse, sexual abuse, youth pregnancy, social and cultural integration, and HIV-Aids, she said.According to Noncedo since the programme started, they already had more than 40 young people who successfully benefited from the project. The men and women who went through our camp started a cooperative called Stars of Cooperatives which is a major success. Noncedo said that they used to issue the facilitation job through tender processes but young people who participated in the programme were then facilitators. They opened cooperatives and now work as facilitators. This is an improvement and proof that the youth camps do work, she said.Noncedo said they had spoken with the Department of Water Affairs (DWA) and the Department of Defence (DOD) to offer opportunities to young people within their youth development programmes. We asked the DWA to absorb at least 1000 of our young people in some of the programmes that they offer. We also asked the DOD to take some and give them job opportunities within defence.They know them, they know how they work and I trust they did a good job disciplining them, she said.Noncedo said they also partnered with the National Skills Financial Aid Scheme to fund those who had the ability to study and might not have the money to fund their education. We understand NSFAS also works on studies but asked them to prioritise our students when issuing bursaries.We also realised that those students who are from child-headed households, from previously disadvantaged areas and those who are orphans were not receiving financial aid and so, the need to intervene, she said.Social development has also conducted a comprehensive impact assessment into the youth camp, to find out how effective it has been. We want to be able to trace all those who participated in our camps and find out how far they are in life and by doing an assessment, will allow us to evaluate the impact of the camp in their lives, she said.Noncedo said they would ultimately document the achievements and the challenges faced by the young people at youth camps and published it in a public document. At the end of the day, we want to be able to develop young people and help them sustain themselves and yes, this programme is working and we are seeing fruits of our labour, she said.A participant in the youth camp, Balungile Sofuthi, who is originally from the Western Cape said he hoped through this programme he would be able to reach out to the national department for opportunities.Sofuthi said in his province, opportunities were not reaching young people and so he decided to participate in the camp to get better access. He said he studied political science at the University of Western Cape and was presently busy with a mechanical engineering qualification with the Vaal University of Technology.He, however, could not explain why he struggled to find a job in mainstream economy when he was in the actual fact, qualified.Sofuthi said he still believed the government should connect him to job opportunities and that was why he participated in the programme. At this point I don t know how to start a business and while I understand that the government cannot hire everyone, I hope that the business skills I gained here will come in handy, he said.NOMUSA MVUBU
