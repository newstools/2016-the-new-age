The NPA expressed satisfaction at the five life sentences handed down by the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane on a man who brutally killed his wife and their four children three years ago.George Risenga Makhubele, 47, who pleaded not guilty to all five counts of murder was nevertheless convicted and sentenced to five life terms after the court found that he had showed no remorse for his deeds.The court heard that on December 28, 2013 he went to sleep at his RDP house at Chloe-Lekgorong village in Ga-Matlala with his wife and children.The following morning his wife, Phuti Mantsho, 34, their daughters, Masango five, Kgotso, four, and Nyiko, two, were found dead with their throats slit. They also sustained multiple stab wounds. The two-month-old baby, Kgaugelo s head was crushed to a pulp with a hammer.Makhubele was lying unconscious after drinking poison and was taken to hospital under arrest.After recovering from hospital, Makhubele was put on trial for nearly three years, until he was slapped with a life sentence on each of the five counts of murder last week. Arguing in aggravation of sentence, advocate Lucas Davhana for the state, submitted that the accused never showed any remorse. He also wasted the court s time by pretending to be a mentally disturbed person, Davhana said. The accused is not a suitable candidate for rehabilitation and he never apologised to the mother of his deceased wife. In welcoming the sentence, the director of public prosecutions in the province, advocate Ivy Thenga, said: The core message of the NPA will in all respect focus on contributing to society s perceptions of crime and that all people of South Africa feel safe. The court heard that Makhubele had marital problems with his wife and she left with their children to stay with her mother during November 2013.On Christmas Eve of that year, he went to his wife s home and pleaded with her to come back with their children. She was reluctant because of their marital problems but nevertheless agreed without knowing that their RDP house would be their slaughter house.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
