After revealing the guiltiest secrets of Wisteria Lane in &#8220;Desperate Housewives,&#8221; Marc Cherry is honing in on a small Kentucky town for his next small-screen show, which is currently untitled.ABC scored one of its biggest hits with &#8220;Desperate Housewives,&#8221; which aired between 2004 and 2012. It&#8217;s therefore only logical to see the channel play host to the latest creation from Marc Cherry, the brains behind the adventures of the now legendary housewives. Released from previous commitments to &#8220;Devious Maids&#8221; (Lifetime), which was canceled in August, the series creator is now free to work on new projects.Marc Cherry is sticking with a subject he is fond of and in which he excels: revealing the darkest and most shameful secrets of a community. This time, the setting is a small town in Kentucky, called Oxblood, which is left reeling following a suspected act of terrorism at the town&#8217;s July 4 parade. The FBI sends an arrogant agent to investigate, who is forced to team up with the local sheriff. But what the agent discovers is beyond anything he could possibly have imagined.The series will be developed entirely by Marc Cherry, who will be writing and producing the show. For the moment, only one name has been announced on the cast, country singer and actress Reba McEntire (&#8220;Malibu Country,&#8221; &#8220;Reba&#8221;), playing the role of the Oxblood sheriff.It&#8217;s too early to say whether the project will be picked up by ABC for the 2017/2018 season.Currently, only a first script has been orfdered. The presence of Marc Cherry doesn&#8217;t guarantee the project&#8217;s feasibility either. Last year, the series creator came up with &#8220;Cheerleader Death Squad&#8221; for the CW network, following a group of students recruited as spies by a teacher and former CIA agent. With ABC, he previously had plans to adapt the novel, &#8220;The Phantom of the Opera.&#8221; Neither project was retained by the networks.-Relaxnews
