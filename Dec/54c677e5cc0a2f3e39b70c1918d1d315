KwaZulu-Natal is making steady progress in processing the land claims lodged with the Lands Claims Commission before the 1998 deadline but several factors, including communal property trust infighting, are hampering the finalisation of more than 2000 claims.To date the province has finalised a total of 15280 and awarded redress of more than R2bn in financial compensation, spent almost R7bn in land acquisitions and R1.2bn in development grants.Some of the province s success stories include a cheque of R50.3m recently handed over to 1300 beneficiaries in Glencoe who were forcibly removed in 1961. I m truly thankful to God and our government, we never thought this would happen in our lifetime, many have fallen in the battle for righteousness, beneficiary Dolly Madela said.However, for the 17 beneficiaries of the Izindophi Communal Property Trust, which was settled in 2004, the journey has not ended as the transfer of land is stuck at the conveyancing stage with the land remaining in state hands.Infighting between claimants resulted in the trust s deputy chairperson Sifiso Ngema and five others taking the matter to the Durban High Court, claiming some trustees were not residents of the affected farms and were not entitled to benefit nor receive bi-annual payments from Tongaat Hullet, which farms sugarcane on the approximately 300ha land. This has dragged on forever and I m starting to think that I might die without seeing this land issue through. What makes me sad is that my children may never benefit because of a selfish man who is driven by greed and would rather we all lose out than him not getting the whole pie for himself, one of the claimants Mildred Biyela said.The 60 year old and the trust s secretary, Mduduzi Nzuza, disputed Ngema s claims, saying the court had also realised that he did not have a strong case and that is why the matter was sent for arbitration. They (Ngema and others) didn t arrive for three consecutive sittings of the arbitration and they are now changing their story saying the chairperson, Ceasar Ngcobo, is not a legitimate beneficiary but we all know it s just sour grapes because Ngema wanted to be the chair but didn t get enough votes so Ngcobo won, Nzuza said.KZN Land Commission spokesperson Nokuthokoza Zulu said the arbitrator had requested the complainants to formally withdraw the initial case and open a new file about illegitimate beneficiaries for which the deadline was November 4 but nothing has happened. The deadline was extended to December 5. If they do not meet the new deadline the arbitrator will make a ruling. The delay of this process impacts negatively on the finalisation of transfer and the regularisation of the legal entity which will assist in the signing of settlement agreements and transfer documents, Zulu said.When The New Age contacted Ngema for comment he denied that he had changed his case and refused to elaborate on his plans to take the matter forward. Meanwhile, Zulu said about 40000 new cases had been lodged since the reopening of the claims process in 2014, but these could not be processed following July s Constitutional Court ruling which declared the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act of 2014 invalid because of the lack of adequate public consultation.NOKUTHULA NTULI
