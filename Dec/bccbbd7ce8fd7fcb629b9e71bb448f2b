The Reserve Bank said at the weekend it had fined two banks relating to weaknesses in their money-laundering protocols. Five banks were punished in August for similar practices.The Bank has imposed fines on the local branch of France s Soci t G n rale and Barclays Africa s retail banking unit, Absa, over weaknesses in their measures to combat money laundering and financing of terrorism. They were fined R2m and R10m respectively.Neither bank was accused of facilitating transactions involving money laundering or the financing of terrorism. We have imposed administrative sanctions on Soci t G n rale Johannesburg and Absa and directed them to take remedial action, the Reserve Bank said.This was after the bank had conducted inspections in terms of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (Fica) and found weaknesses in the banks anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism control measures, the bank said.Fica mandates the Reserve Bank to ensure commercial banks develop adequate controls to combat acts of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Flowing from these responsibilities, the Bank inspects banks to assess whether they have appropriate measures in place.Both banks are cooperating with the Bank and have taken measures to address the identified compliance deficiencies and control weaknesses.In August this year, similar action was taken against five banks relating to weaknesses in control measures to combat money laundering, with the fines amounting to R34.5m. The five banks were GBS Mutual Bank, Habib Overseas Bank, Investec Bank, The SA Bank of Athens and the Standard Chartered.Bernard Sathekgebernards@thenewage.co.za
