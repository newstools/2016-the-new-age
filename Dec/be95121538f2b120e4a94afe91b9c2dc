The Centre for Values Promotion, Heartlines, has called on victims and perpetrators of violence in South Africa to tell their own stories. The founder of the Johannesburg based NGO, Garth Japhet, said violence was not a one-dimensional problem. Resolving and preventing it requires an approach that engages all people involved, be it directly or indirectly. Addressing violence through storytelling is not easy, especially within a society that often assigns blame to victims of domestic and sexual abuse, Japhet said.He said personal stories are often used to help people cope with grief, stress and trauma. They can be used as metaphors and examples of larger societal problems and concerns. Stories not only transfer knowledge, they can change behaviour and become a tool for positive change, Japhet said.Heartlines uses storytelling because of its role in building understanding, addressing social divides and promoting values such as empathy, responsibility and forgiveness. Stories can inspire both action and acceptance, particularly when they engage and involve the people who listen to them. They ignite empathy and imagination and are often remembered and retold. Storytelling in itself can be a healing experience, Japhet said.Bringing more South Africans into the conversation around violence and the values that counter it, Heartlines produces storytelling resources for schools, campuses, workplaces, churches and inmates in prison. It promotes the action of taking responsibility and reflecting on the impact of one s behaviour, likewise giving a victim the opportunity to share their story can help them with their healing process, he said.Nondumiso Zwane|news@thenewage.co.za
