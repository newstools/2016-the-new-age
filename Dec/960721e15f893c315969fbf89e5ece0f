CORPORAL punishment, gangsterism, lack of safety in schools and sexual assaults are the main reasons for unsafe conditions in Western Cape schools.The province is known for its rife gangsterism, especially areas in the Cape Flats such as Manenberg, Elsies River and Valhalla Park and townships such as Khayelitsha, Nyanga and Gugulethu.In 2013, about 14 schools closed in Manenberg after a surge in gang violence when the lives of pupils and teachers were in danger.The department has budgeted R30m for the Safe Schools programme this year, which has three key functions of crime control, crime prevention and building partnership to ensure safety of pupils.According to the department, community safety and crime control rests with the South African Police Service (SAPS) but while they do everything possible to protect pupils while they are on school premises, they are not able to protect the pupils while they are off the school premises. However, the protection of pupils during the day at school is feasible.Education MEC Debbie Sch fer said: The department is working together with our various stakeholders, including Safe Schools, to improve the safety of pupils and teachers affected by gang violence. We will continue to engage with the police when it comes to stepping up law enforcement around our schools. Every school forms part of its community and is inevitably affected by challenges facing any community, including the scourge of gangsterism and drugs.Furthermore, the department stated in communities where gangsterism is prominent, it can sometimes spill into their schools. The department expressed its concern about any violence affecting pupils in the province, be it inside the school premises or outside. To a large extent, our schools provide safe havens for pupils who live in communities plagued by violence and gangsterism. However, our schools are not immune from these issues, because they are rooted in the communities they serve, Sch fer said.The department has a number of behavioural interventions to try to stop pupils from engaging in anti-social or gang-related activities. They include anti-gang strategies to deter pupils from joining a gang. These programmes happen throughout the school year and during school holidays in partnership with other provincial departments such as social development and community safety, the department said.-KEITUMETSI MOTLHALE
