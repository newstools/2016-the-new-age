Olympique Lyonnais will wait until the last minute to decide if keeper Anthony Lopes is fit to play in Wednesday&#8217;s Champions League decider against Sevilla after firecrackers were thrown at him during a Ligue 1 game, coach Bruno Genesio said.Lopes was taken to hospital with hearing problems after the incident, which occurred in the first half of Lyon&#8217;s game at Metz on Saturday.The match was abandoned with Metz leading 1-0.&#8220;Anthony Lopes is recovering slowly from the shock. He will train today and we will decide tomorrow morning,&#8221; Genesio told a news conference on Tuesday.&#8220;He is a bit better, it could have been worse,&#8221; added captain Maxime Gonalons.Lyon are third in Group H on seven points, three adrift of second-placed Sevilla, and will qualify for the first knockout round if they win by at least a two-goal margin.-Reuters
