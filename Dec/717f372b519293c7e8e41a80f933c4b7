Animal lovers will have to wait another four years for the relocation of the Bloemfontein Zoo to be completed.The city has reported that the completion of this project is earmarked for the 2019-20 financial year.However, a few animals, like waterbuck, zebras and an eland have already been relocated to a new site in Kwaggafontein and the rest will be moved once the new zoo has been completed.The Mangaung metro says it is awaiting for the environmental impact assessment report before it can earnestly start with the construction of a new zoo in Kwaggafontein, about 10km southwest of the city centre.The city has reported that a master plan for the new zoo allows for a totally new facility and the relocation of the zoo. It said it had completed all necessary environmental reports and approvals were in process. A perimeter fence was erected at the site of the zoo in 2015 and plans to build an entrance and guard house have been drawn up. A contractor to build those facilities has already been appointed, the city said. The projected total cost of the facility is expected to be in the region of R300m, the city said.The metro has also reported that it would develop a theme park at the Kwaggafontein Game Reserve.The decision for the relocation of the zoo came after growing concerns from individuals and animal rights interest groups over its location in the middle of the city. They were also concerned about overcrowding, since the zoo s location meant it lacked adequate space.In 2013 a feasibility study approved the relocation of the zoo. The study, done by Ecocare, was commissioned by the Mangaung metropolitan municipality, which owns the zoo.The study showed that the move was in the best interests of the animals, since the zoo is in the city centre. The animals were thus negatively affected by worsening levels of air, noise and light pollution.It had recommended that the zoo be moved to the proposed site along the R48 road to Petrusburg, which it said was ideally situated for the development of a zoo as it was big enough to build large enclosures for the animals. Some animals will be allowed to roam freely.According to the study, the present zoo s limited space meant expansions and upgrades could be done and the animals did not have as much space as they should.KAMOGELO SEEKOEIkamogelos@thenewage.co.za
