This was the year of municipal elections and some defining moments in the National Assembly. We started 2016 with a historic proceedings in the Constitutional Court, which involved among others, some opposition parties as applicants on the one hand, the President and the National Assembly as respondents on the other.The Constitutional Court judgment on the Nkandla matter was extremely significant for our system of governance, because it gave further clarity in the definition of the meaning of our constitutional democratic system of governance.We appreciate the judgment and its important findings as lessons for all citizens, state institutions, organs of civil society and political parties in particular. The court findings about the head of the executive, the President as well as the National Assembly, which are widely publicised, were a devastating blow as we begun 2016 and it set the tone.The darkest cloud fell on the South African nation, when the National Assembly failed to act decisively on the findings of the Constitutional Court.The vote of no confidence in the President that was supported by opposition parties fell flat. Even proposals made by opposition parties with regard to the findings made by the Constitutional Court against the National Assembly were arrogantly ignored. This is important because, it hits at the core of the business of Parliament, which is to hold the executive to account on behalf of the citizens of our country.Parliament had an opportunity to engage seriously on the issues related to the property clause in our Constitution through the debate on the Expropriation Bill. The United Democratic Movement (UDM) made a proposal that there should be a broader discussion on the road map for economic transformation.Such a debate would include issues related to property ownership centrally being the land question. Unfortunately, this view, which we still believe is relevant, has not been supported by the ruling party.In fact, the President during an oral question session in Parliament, opted to cast aspersions on the validity of this proposal by questioning whether the UDM and other opposition parties will be prepared to abandon their policies. If we are to make a significant change in the structural make-up of our economy and address poverty, unemployment and inequality, we remain convinced that the best way is to convene a national indaba involving all South Africans along the similar lines of Codesa.Recently, Parliament was surprised to hear through the media that the government has served notice to withdraw from the International Criminal Court. It is our view that the matter should have been canvassed through Parliament before it is implemented, primarily because our participation in that court was done through an act of Parliament.During this year the President and many members of the executive have not been helpful with regard to accountability. This is an area that the presiding officers must still improve in order to give meaning to the core mandate of Parliament. Parliament has witnesses a growing demand for attention from organs of civil society which have either submitted petitions or protested in front of its gates.They have made many important contributions in the work of the government and Parliament. The UDM has always supported these initiatives This include thes #FeesMustFall movement, the former mine and transport workers who marched to Parliament, the Save South African campaign and others. It is our firm view, that an active citizenry is a cornerstone of a working democracy.As we gravitate towards the conclusion of this calendar year, we are looking forward to what Parliament will do with regard to the State of Capture report, when the time for it to act has descended. We hope that the arrogance and abuse of the majority will find reason to bury its ugly head.This report like all reports of Chapter 9 institutions will come to Parliament to discharge its responsibility of holding the executive to account.In summary the year 2016, presented and opportunity for Parliament to reaffirm itself as the voice of all South Africans, especially the poor, the voiceless and the least remembered. However, not all political parties and their members in Parliament, understand that their first responsibility is to serve the nation above their narrow party loyalty.Consequently, Parliament did not rise to the occasion. Instead it dropped the ball because the ruling party understand majority to mean utter arrogance, gross disregard the Constitution and the rule of law, undermining the intelligence of the collective of the people and defend a flawed and compromised President with pride.In 2017, the UDM will continue where it left off in 2016 and make its views known to the nation using the democratic platform of Parliament.Our contribution to the ending of the xenophobia violence, the calming of violent protests, the fight against corruption and misuse of public assets are some of the great strides we have made during the year.Bantu HolomisaBantu Holomisa is the leader of the United Democratic Movement
