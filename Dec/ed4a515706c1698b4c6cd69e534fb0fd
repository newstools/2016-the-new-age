Study suggests you should wear a pair for added action between the sheets. It&#8217;s no mean feat when science says socks help you orgasm.Researchers at the University of Groningen found that 80 per cent of couples reached orgasm while wearing socks. Only 50 per cent managed to climax without them.According to the researchers, pulling on a pair keeps you warm, helps the blood vessels in your feet dilate, allowing for improved blood flow. This facilitates orgasms and sleep.That said, wearing socks during sex still remains a hotly debated topic. While some reject the idea outright, others say that cosy toes do give sex a leg up in the bedroom.This article first appeared on The Times of India
