Migrant community leaders who marched to the office of the Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba yesterday have given him until January 16 to respond to their demands, which were submitted to his office yesterday.The migrant communities, under the banner of the African Diaspora Forum, took to Mashaba s office following his rants about illegal migrants in the city.Chairperson of the forum Marc Gbaffou said they wanted to have a frank and honest discussion with the mayor and wanted him to engage the memorandum of grievances before coming back to them. We asked him to invite people from the private sector to join in the discussions. We also want migrants to be part of the talks because we want them to be part of every decision that is taken, he said.Gbaffou said the government should not act as though migrants were refusing documentation when it was being offered to them when the truth was that migrants were struggling to get their papers.Speaking during a briefing on his 100 days in office, Mashaba said he would not allow the city to be hijacked by criminals who had come into the city illegally.He said he had spoken to human rights lawyers and the respective embassies to help with illegal migrants in the city.One of the leaders at the march said Mashaba s comments were disgusting as it suggested that all migrants in the city were criminals. Mashaba was not in office to accept the memorandum and the MMC for community development Nonhlanhla Sifumba accepted the document.LILLIAN SELAPISAsnn4@thenewage.co.za
