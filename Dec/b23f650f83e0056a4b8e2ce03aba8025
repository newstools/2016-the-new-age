The two men accused of assaulting and forcing Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa into a coffin were denied bail by the Middelburg Magistrates Court on Thursday.Magistrate Emmanuel Dumehleli delivering his judgement said it was clear the attack on Mlotshwa was nothing else other than brutal racism adding that &#8220;action speaks louder than words.&#8221;Dumehleli however added that he does not want to create an impression that all farmers are racist. &#8220;Even Blacks, Indians and Chinese can be racist. Racism is a virus the whole world is trapped under&#8221; said Dumehleni.The court rejected the argument by Theo Martins Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen that Victor had threatened them when they had the courage to place Mlotshwa in a coffin and that he had been trying to steal copper cables from them.&#8221; If the applicants were threatened by the victim [Victor] surely when they handed themselves over they could have mentioned it &#8221; said Dumehleli.The court also ordered that the coffin used by Theo Martins Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen be sent for DNA testing to ascertain whether anyone else had ever been placed in the coffin.Both Theo Martins Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen will be back in the Middelburg Magistrates Court 25 January 2017.The state had previously made it clear it would oppose the duo&#8217;s bail application for fear that they would intimidate witnesses.-Siphiwe Mchunu
