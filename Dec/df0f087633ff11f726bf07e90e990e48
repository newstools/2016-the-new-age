Pakistan spearhead Mohammad Amir is expected to play the Boxing Day Test against Australia despite stiffness and a bruised thigh, officials said Thursday.The left-arm seamer, who completed a five-year ban for spot-fixing last year, left the field during the first Brisbane Test on a motorised stretcher after falling on the Gabba turf.He appeared in agony but returned a short time later and continued to bowl. Amir was also hit on the thigh by a Mitchell Starc full toss.&#8220;There&#8217;s quite a bit of bruising on his thigh,&#8221; Pakistan batting coach Grant Flower told reporters.&#8220;He&#8217;s feeling a bit stiff but he&#8217;s all right.&#8221;Flower said he expected the team to field the same bowling attack in Melbourne that narrowly lost the gripping first Test by just 39 runs.&#8220;I think the guys are fit enough to go through. I think our attack would probably be the same,&#8221; he said.&#8220;It&#8217;s just one of those things that we&#8217;ve had for a while, we don&#8217;t have that all-rounder batsman, batsman-bowler. But it&#8217;s one of those things so the guys will just have to get through it.&#8221;AFP
