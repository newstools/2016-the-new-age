Gauteng drivers who have avoided paying e-tolls bills will soon be forced to as the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) is finalising a plan to block the issuing of renewal of licence discs for those who owe billions in arrear bills.Sanral spokesperson Vusi Mona said: The administrative process by which the issuing of vehicle licence discs are blocked for contravening the National Roads Act (NTA) is being finalised, now that the court process with the service provider managing the eNatis system has been concluded in court. The eNatis system is the country s vehicle management system which keeps records of vehicles including fines will be governed by the Roads Traffic Management Cooperation (RTMC), a government entity following a Constitutional Court judgment which ruled in favour of the government instead of a private firm which previously managed the system.Gauteng motorists owed Sanral about R1bn in 2014 and that has increased to R11.4bn.Mona said more than 75% of registered vehicles fitted with e-tags pay less. Debtors who continue to ignore e-toll bills were targeted in a concerted debt recovery plan by Sanral that started on October 1, he said.He said the decision to issue summons to debt defaulters was taken after the conclusion of 60% discount on e-toll bills did not attract many debtors.But the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) chairperson, Wayne Duvenage, urged the public to notify Outa if they encounter challenges when renewing licence disks as a result of unpaid e-tolls.Batandwa Malingo
