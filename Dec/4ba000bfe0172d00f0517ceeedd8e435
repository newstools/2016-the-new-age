I wanted those that owe me to come forward and do what is right. Those who know me I was an individual who always wants to work hard and achieve on his might and strength not depending on anyone but some people took advantage of my good will heart and kindness to work and I use my resources at the end they benefit but I don&#8217;t it&#8217;s hurting me everyday when I see those individuals living a full life while I fight for my own with this skin cancer, Ranko said. He said he did not post his story on social media to be felt sorry for. I can&#8217;t really name all individuals by name and you live with your families on my sweat. This problem of individuals ignoring my calls and messages yet you see them it hurts deep down, you know Mpho Ranko did a great job of PR but never got a cent from the gigs. I have been silent for long and I let myself and my business, he said.Guys, wishing Mpho a speedy recovery is not enough. He needs all the financial help from us. #HelpMpho pic.twitter.com/smCLrFXaWD Mbongeni Gegana (@MGegana7) December 22, 2016Mpho&#8217;s story is heartbreaking .Guys please assist #HelpMpho Lord Baelish (@Mfumo_B) December 22, 2016My heart bleeds seeing this generous and full of life guy lying helplessly in bed like that.
