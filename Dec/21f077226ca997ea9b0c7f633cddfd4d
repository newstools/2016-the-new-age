ACCORDING to the Paper Recycling Association of South Africa, one ton of recycled paper can save up to three cubic metres of landfill space.Last year, 1.2 million tons of paper and cardboard were recycled, which was subsequently converted into new paper products. That volume of paper would have occupied 3.6 million cubic metres of landfill space, or 1 435 Olympic-sized swimming pools, said Donna Noble, communications manager at Mpact, formerly known as Mondi Recycling. Reducing, reusing or recycling all that Christmas packaging can make an enormous difference to the environment, she said. Remember to recycle your wrapping paper, gift packaging, cardboard, cereal boxes, office paper and newspaper, milk and juice cartons and plastic beverage bottles. A lot of what we call rubbish is actually recyclable, she said.

A lot of what we call rubbish is actually recyclable, she said.Noble advised citizens to make their own festive wrapping paper, decorations and gifts, and urged the public to separate their recyclables. She said separating one s paper, plastic, glass and cans at source enables a far greater percentage to be recycled.This is because they can become contaminated and unusable when they are mixed with normal waste. Please remember that your items such as cold drink bottles are not trash.They are a livelihood for many thousands of collectors and an essential raw material to improving sustainable plastic manufacturing, said Noble.Many suburban areas are serviced by a kerbside collection service for paper, while collectors in many areas also gather plastic and metal.The collectors sell their recyclables to their closest drop-off site, such as the buy-back centres supported by Mpact. With one eye on our environment and the other on festive family fun, we can all have a merry Christmas and a happy New Year in the knowledge that our planet won t be suffering the hangover afterwards, Noble said.ntombin@thenewage.co.za
