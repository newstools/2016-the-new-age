As fans, friends and colleagues continue to mourn and celebrate the legacy of gospel singer Sfiso Ncwane following his untimely death on Monday, the Ncwane family, through its spokesperson Sipho Makhabane, said they were encouraged by the support from friends and the gospel fraternity. The family is coping under the circumstances. They have come together to decide on the funeral arrangements. We have agreed on two memorial services, Makhabane said. Sfiso was more than just a gospel icon, he was a friend to many, and big soccer fan so there are plans to have his favourite club (Orlando Pirates) also being accommodated in the programme and some of his fans from Cape Town also wanting to have a chance at celebrating his life. At a family meeting on Tuesday it was announced that award-winning gospel artist will be honoured at two official memorial services, with the third one set for Jebbe Hall in Nangoza, Port Elizabeth.The first memorial service takes place this morning at the Ethekwini Community Church in Durban.
