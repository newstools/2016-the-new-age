Arsene Wenger defended his strategy and blamed his players lack of urgency for Arsenal&#8217;s League Cup quarter-final exit.Wenger had been hoping to win the competition for the first time, but instead his decision to make 10 changes backfired with Southampton winning 2-0 to end his side&#8217;s 19-game unbeaten run.Midfielder Mohamed Elneny was the only survivor from Sunday&#8217;s Premier League win over Bournemouth, but even Granit Xhaka and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain coming off the bench failed to make an impact.&#8220;I regret that we lost the game. We had played well until now,&#8221; said Wenger.&#8220;If you look at the players who played well tonight (Wednesday), some of those who did not play tonight were on the edge.&#8220;In midfield we had (Francis) Coquelin, (Aaron) Ramsey, Elneny, Xhaka, (Lucas) Perez&#8230; (Olivier) Giroud was injured. We had (Alex) Iwobi, one of the regular players in the first team.&#8220;The problem wasn&#8217;t there. We had players who are used to top-level competition. But we didn&#8217;t have the right urgency.He added: &#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed. We had a disappointing performance, particularly in the first half.&#8220;I think we were not good enough defensively and gave cheap goals away in the first half.&#8220;It was better in the second, but it was one of those nights where you look like you could play two hours without scoring a goal.&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have enough urgency in the first half and were weak in some departments. We paid for that. We were not incisive enough in the first half especially.&#8220;They played deeper in the second half and were sharper than us and fitter. If you give someone a handicap of two goals, against a Premier League side it&#8217;s difficult.&#8221;Southampton are through to their first League Cup semi-final since 1987, when they were beaten over two legs by Liverpool, the same team they face in this year&#8217;s semi-finals.Manager Claude Puel was happy with how his team performed. &#8220;It was a great performance because this game was a different profile,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We were clinical in the first half, with two goals from two chances. I like this.&#8220;After, in the second half, we had many chances to score another goal and make the game safe against a good team.&#8220;It was a fantastic game to achieve that result: good solidarity, good attitude. I enjoyed what my players did.&#8220;We have a chance to play a semi-final, home and away, in the second half of the season. That was the objective.&#8220;(There are some) very important games in the future.&#8221;&#8211;AFP
