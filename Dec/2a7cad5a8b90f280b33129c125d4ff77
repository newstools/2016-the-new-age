Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said on Monday he has been moved from his prison cell to a health clinic in Lima to undergo testing for a brain condition and problems moving his right shoulder.Fujimori, 78, has been serving a 25-year sentence since 2009 for graft and human rights abuses during his 1990-2000 authoritarian rule.Fujimori said on Twitter that he had been admitted to a clinic in Lima to be scanned for risk of brain ischemia, which is a lack of blood flow to the brain and can lead to strokes. He said he also has &#8220;persistent limitations moving my right shoulder and hematomas that extend toward my elbow.&#8221;Fujimori&#8217;s doctor was not immediately available for comment.Fujimori has undergone medical treatment outside prison several times in recent years for problems ranging from high blood pressure and depression to a growth on his tongue.Fujimori&#8217;s eldest daughter, Keiko Fujimori, narrowly lost her second presidential bid this year.President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has said he would not pardon Fujimori but would be willing to sign legislation that allows aging prisoners like him serve their sentences under house arrest.-Reuters
