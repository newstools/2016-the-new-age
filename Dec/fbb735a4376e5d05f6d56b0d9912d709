Stigma among many individuals, due to ignorance and fear still exists on a scale that can only be dismissed through educationSouth African youths aged 15-24 are among the highest HIV-prevalent group in the world today.This statistic published by the Population Studies and Training Centre at Brown University in the US, is not far from being entirely factual in contrast to many other national and international studies.However, it is in this group of our society that we can actually inspire hope to end this pandemic worldwide. It is crucial that young children should have more intensive awareness and education on HIV and Aids as well as Tuberculosis in schools.The Joint UN Programme on HIV-Aids (UNAids) recently said we are winning the war on HIV-Aids.UNAids says Aids-related deaths have fallen by 45% since the peak in 2005 while 1.1 million people died from Aids-related causes globally last year, compared to 2 million in 2005.Although we are curbing HIV-Aids in some parts of the world, we are still witnessing growing HIV infections in certain demographics in Africa, especially among young women and children. For example, last year, women accounted for more than half of the 19 million people living with HIV in eastern and southern Africa while there were 56000 new infections among children in the same region.Overall, there were an estimated 410000 and 960000 new HIV infections in eastern and southern Africa and western and central Africa respectively.The increase in HIV infections in some countries was highlighted by Michel Sidib , executive director of UNAids, in his opening address at the 21st International Aids Conference held in Durban a few months ago.In his speech, Sidib warned against complacency in the fight against HIV-Aids. He said that in some African countries, 25% of young women will become infected before they turn 25, he called for investment in young women, harm reduction, pre-exposure prophylaxis, condoms, voluntary medical male circumcision, social protection and community action.Sidib said that by 2020, all countries and communities should have reduced the number of new infections by 75%.Sidib s call for vigilance clearly indicates that the battle is far from over and much more must be done before we can claim victory over HIV-Aids.In this regard, the Africa Centre for HIV and Aids Management at Stellenbosch University is continuously striving to raise awareness about HIV-Aids and to show that by working together it can be beaten.Over the past 12 years, we have spread this message across the country through our academic programme, educational theatre, community interventions and dialogues among disadvantaged and poor community members, farm workers and school children, businesses and parastatals.As a centre, we have witnessed not only the growing will of prominent role players in diverse communities who partner with us but also the evidence of effectiveness in minimising new incidences and infections, dispelling stigma and inequality, promoting wellness and responsible sexual behaviour to enhance a healthy lifestyle and behaviour choices among them.That said, the stigma among many individuals, due to ignorance and fear, still exists on a scale that can only be dismissed through education.In an attempt to change people s perception and knowledge about HIV-Aids we, as a team, are pushing full steam ahead to continue this approach of prevention by educating many disadvantaged and rural communities throughout South Africa and internationally.Ideally, our work cannot end until every responsible citizen knows his or her HIV status and is equipped with factual knowledge and information to continue on a path of responsible choices and behaviour.Unfortunately, external funding to South Africa to assist in the Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN or by our national government s mandate on pushing forward to eliminate HIV-Aids is fading.Without question, South Africa must become more active in its implementation to enhance support to our local and provincial entities to do the work that they re capable of doing, namely saving lives.South Africa knows best how to educate, prevent and allow access to treatment for its own people. It is time to let go of off-shore dictating, funds and ineptness on how to best serve the people of this country.In fact, South Africa has done an exemplary job in addressing HIV-Aids yet, there is still much more to do across the country with mutual partnerships and leadership.As the battle against HIV-Aids rages on, excellence in education, continued awareness and modes of prevention are and will remain very much a part of the recipe to continue the journey toward an Aids-free world for current and future generations.We should all be a part of the solution and get ourselves tested, and discuss fully the ramifications of irresponsible sexual and social behaviour with our families, our children, spouses and partners.Last, but not least, we have to educate ourselves.-Jimmie earl perry
