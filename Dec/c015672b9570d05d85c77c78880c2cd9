Crystal Palace&#8217;s 1-1 draw at Watford in the Premier League had a sting in the tail as an argument blew up over the behaviour of the home team&#8217;s mascot Harry the Hornet.Palace forward Wilfried Zaha, booked for diving in Monday&#8217;s match, was clearly upset and ushered away by staff when the mascot performed a mock dive at his feet after the final whistle.&#8220;The mascot was out of order,&#8221; Palace&#8217;s new manager Sam Allardyce told reporters, suggesting the incident should be investigated.&#8220;The Premier League and FA can look at that and do what they want to do,&#8221; he said.&#8220;That&#8217;s up to Watford to sort that out really. It could have made the wrong reaction as we know. The mascot is out of order, isn&#8217;t he? If someone is diving, they don&#8217;t get that angry. But I&#8217;m concerned about my team and the overall performance.&#8221;Watford manager Walter Mazzarri preferred to look at the funny side.&#8220;I think we should laugh all together, football is nice for these things, it doesn&#8217;t have to be a drama,&#8221; he said.Watford did not comment on Tuesday although Sky Sports said the club would not be taking action.The mascot said on his Twitter account OfficialHarryHornet: &#8220;I respect all professional footballers and always wish away supporters a safe journey home.&#8221;His opposite number, Palace mascot Pete the Eagle, said the episode had been blown out of proportion.&#8220;That mascot stuff made the back pages?! Really?! Baffling. Perhaps news outlets are struggling for new angles for stories?,&#8221; he said on Twitter.&#8220;We&#8217;re eight-foot furry creatures, and most of us don&#8217;t take ourselves too seriously. We&#8217;re there to add to the Matchday experience.&#8221;-Reuters
