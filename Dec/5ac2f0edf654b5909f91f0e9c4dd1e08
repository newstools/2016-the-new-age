RB Leipzig are playing on their role as underdogs to score some psychological points ahead of Wednesday&#8217;s crunch Bundesliga clash against Bayern Munich.&#8220;If we win, it would be a fairly big surprise. Anything other than a Bayern win would be a disappointment from a Munich point of view,&#8221; Ralf Rangnick, Leipzig&#8217;s sports director, told SID, an AFP subsidiary, on Tuesday.&#8220;For us, this is a bonus game, which we go into as outsiders.&#8220;We want to build on our good performances and perhaps get a scoop.&#8221;Bayern host Leipzig at the Allianz Arena with the sides neck and neck on 36 points with the champions topping the table on goal difference.Leipzig, only founded in 2009, had a stellar 2016, gaining second division promotion in May and going a record 13-matches unbeaten at the start of their first season in Germany&#8217;s top flight.&#8220;From a sporting perspective, it was a dream year,&#8221; said Rangnick.&#8220;Everyone in Germany, and also us in Leipzig, are of course surprised by this fantastic first half of the season.&#8221;Leipzig&#8217;s success has come with a squad, with an average of 23, who were mostly unheard of before this season.They have nothing to lose in the club&#8217;s first league match against star-studded Bayern, which has 15 internationals in their squad and seven World Cup winners from Spain and Germany.&#8220;Any team which is forced onto the defensive by Bayern don&#8217;t have a chance,&#8221; said Rangnick.&#8220;Our style of play is characterised by a high level of willingness to run, aggression and passion.&#8220;But we have never played against a team whose individual players have such quality.&#8221;&#8211; 110 kilometres &#8211;Bayern have a habit of signing up top talent from their rivals and club president Uli Hoeness has already suggested Leipzig&#8217;s coach Ralph Hassenhuettl could be a future Munich manager, to follow on from Spain&#8217;s Pep Guardiola and current incumbent Carlo Ancelotti from Italy.&#8220;If we should ever look for a (native) German-speaking coach, he certainly is one of the three candidates to think about,&#8221; Bayern president Uli Hoeness told Bild.&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a while before Bayern get a German coach,&#8221; Austrian-born Hassenhuettl observed drily.On average, Leipzig have run four kilometres (2.5miles) more than their opponents per league game and Hassenhuettl intends to make Bayern run for their lives.&#8220;We want to make sure that Bayern have to do something and also that they have to cover 110 kilometres,&#8221; he said, referring to the average distance covered in a Bundesliga game.Rangnick acknowledges that while prestige and three points are at stake, the showdown will have little bearing on who lifts the title next May.The 58-year-old has been here before.He was Hoffenheim coach in 2008/09 when the club were top midway through their first Bundesliga season, only to eventually finish seventh.&#8220;If the example of Hoffenheim tells us something, it&#8217;s that the title &#8216;Autumn champions&#8217; (the name given to the table leaders in December) is worth practically nothing,&#8221; said Rangnick.He also doubts Leipzig will make any new signings in the January transfer window.&#8220;There is no reason to change anything,&#8221; he said.&#8220;From our side, it is not planned that we&#8217;ll sign any new players in the winter break.AFP
