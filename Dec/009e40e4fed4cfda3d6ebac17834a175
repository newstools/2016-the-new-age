SOWETO-BORN Parks Tau was unanimously elected president of the South African Local Government Association (Salga), after he was nominated unopposed yesterday.The last day of the four-day conference, saw the election and confirmation of the national office bearers and the national executive committee, which will preside over and lead the sector guided by Salga s Strategic Framework 2017-22.In October, Tau, the former mayor of Johannesburg, was elected president of the United Cities and Local Government (UCLG) which is the umbrella body for local governments around the world and is made up of more than 1000 cities. I wish to honour the legacy of our past chairpersons and leadership who have built this organisation over the past 20 years and to whom we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude. It is because of their commitment that we have the Salga we are all so proud of today and celebrate, Tau said.He thanked his predecessor Thabo Manyoni and the outgoing NEC for leading the organisation with unity and cohesion over the last five years and achieving four consecutive clean audits. We must acknowledge the massive progress the sector has made over the last 16 years of its democratic life, including the provision of basic services to so many of our people, the rapid development and quality of our infrastructure, increased mobility, investments in social amenities and massive progress in financial management and institutional resilience, Tau said.He said during their term, they will focus on Salga s role as a protector to enforce the rights of local government much more robustly and constructively disrupt (in a positive sense) where the existing overall system (legislative, fiscal, policy, institutional) makes it impossible for local government to deliver on its mandate.-NTOMBI NKOSI
