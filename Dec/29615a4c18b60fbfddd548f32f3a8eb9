Drake&#8217;s &#8220;One Dance&#8221; on Friday notched up another record &#8212; it is the first song to be played a billion times on Spotify.The Canadian rapper&#8217;s song &#8212; which already in October became the most-streamed song ever on Spotify &#8212; had been played 1.002 billion times by early Friday.With a raw funk vibe but minimalist beat, &#8220;One Dance&#8221; has been in heavy rotation at clubs and parties this year.The track, which appears on Drake&#8217;s top-charting album &#8220;Views,&#8221; features guest vocals by Wizkid, one of Nigeria&#8217;s top singers, and British house artist Kyla.Drake&#8217;s totals on Spotify, the largest site in the fast-growing format of streaming, comes even though he has a business tie-up with Apple.The tech giant, whose upstart Apple Music is trying to catch up with Spotify, released &#8220;Views&#8221; exclusively for its first week although individual tracks appeared elsewhere.Despite Drake&#8217;s success, he was surpassed in November for most monthly listeners on Spotify by The Weeknd &#8212; a fellow Toronto artist and protege of Drake.And in a surprise to many music watchers, &#8220;One Dance&#8221; was not nominated for Record of the Year or Song of the Year at the Grammy Awards although Drake is up in other categories.-AFP
