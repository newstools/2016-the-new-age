The International Monetary Fund has approved two loans totaling $658.9 million for the Ivory Coast, while welcoming recent economic and financial reforms made by the country.Abidjan will immediately receive a $94.1 million tranche, while the rest will be paid following semi-annual reviews of the economic program&#8217;s implementation, the IMF said Monday.IMF Deputy Managing Director Mitsuhiro Furusawa said the Ivory Coast &#8220;economy has made an impressive turnaround since 2012 and its outlook remains favorable.&#8220;Nevertheless, reducing poverty and closing human capital and infrastructure gaps will take time, and structural bottlenecks pose challenges.&#8221;The IMF noted the country&#8217;s &#8220;impressive turnaround since 2012&#8221; as well as its improved political climate and a &#8220;supportive fiscal policy facilitated by extensive debt relief.&#8221;Real GDP grew an average of nine percent per year between 2012 and 2015, reversing a decline in per capita income that lasted nearly a decade.But this return to growth has not &#8220;fully shed the socio-economic legacies of decades of sluggish growth compounded by conflict,&#8221; the IMF said.For 2016, the IMF expects real GDP to grow at around eight percent over the year.-AFP
