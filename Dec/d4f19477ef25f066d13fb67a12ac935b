An Indonesian court will proceed with a controversial blasphemy case against Jakarta&#8217;s Christian governor, who is accused of insulting the Koran, a judge said on Tuesday.A panel of judges rejected a call by lawyers defending Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama to strike down the case because it had violated the ethnic Chinese politician&#8217;s human rights and breached procedures.&#8220;The exception by the defendant will be considered and decided by the court after examination of all evidence. The defendant&#8217;s exception is not accepted,&#8221; said Judge Abdul Rosyad.A tearful Purnama denied the charges in the first hearing on Dec. 13. The case is seen as a test of religious freedom in the world&#8217;s largest Muslim-majority nation.-Reuters
