Volunteering time to care for elderly friends and neighbors could help them enjoy a longer life, according to new UK research.Carried out by the University of Aberdeen&#8217;s Business School, the study analyzed mortality rates in Japanese seniors in the years following a major earthquake that struck Kobe in 1995.The event led to a huge surge in the number of volunteers providing daily care over a long-term period to elderly residents in earthquake-hit areas, with around 1.4 million people volunteering to help those affected.Voluntary care for the elderly included visits to homes for a chat and assistance with daily tasks.As well as collecting the data on volunteers, Dr Yu Aoki, who carried out the research, also compared the mortality rates of the elderly in the affected areas compared to nearby unaffected areas.The results showed that mortality was significantly lower in areas where rates of volunteering were high.While previous studies have looked at the health benefits of volunteering on volunteers, this study is the first to prove a causal link between volunteering and the longevity of recipients.Dr Aoki commented on the results saying, &#8220;The findings of this research underline the very real value of volunteering to help elderly people who might otherwise be struggling with a lack of daily support or loneliness.&#8221;&#8220;The study also has important implications for societies with ageing populations that face a growing healthcare challenge, and suggests that governments can consider doing more to encourage volunteering as a means to provide the elderly with care.&#8221;The findings can be found published online in the Oxford Economic Papers.-Relaxnews
