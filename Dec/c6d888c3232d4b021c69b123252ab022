Steve Komphela and Dan Malesela share few similarities ahead of Kaizer Chiefs visit to Chippa United in the league match at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium tomorrow.The two coaches look to be operating on borrowed time at their respective clubs following a string of poor results this season.While Malesela may not be experiencing unruly behaviour from his club supporters like his counterpart, Komphela, he is also not safe, more so considering how trigger happy club owner Chippa Mpangesi is when results are not forthcoming.Chippa have not registered a victory in their last eight matches and are 11th on the Absa Premiership log standings with 10 points from 10 matches.Meanwhile, Komphela has had to deal with a section of unruly Chiefs supporters who are baying for his blood.In the last two home matches, which ended in draws, Chiefs supporters threw missiles at Komphela and there could be similar scenes should the result not go their way tomorrow.Just like Chippa, Chiefs have are on a poor run and have not won in their last six matches.Both coaches cannot afford to lose tomorrow s match.Malesela, however, is confident that they will turn it around before is too late. Our focus has now shifted to Kaizer Chiefs. We have one day to prepare for the game tomorrow and will make the most of it, Malesela said. We have forced changes due to injuries, so we have to get the balance right tomorrow. We take lessons from each and every game we play and it was no different against Maritzburg United on Tuesday where we came back with a valuable point. Komphela is desperate to get a victory to ease some of the pressure from the supporters. Part of our jobs as coaches is to keep working, irrespective of whatever, Komphela said. Whatever happens, you have got to get the machine moving, with or without wheels, with or without parts. Keep working, that s all we have to do. Meanwhile, Chiefs goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo is expected to be in goals after Itumeleng Khune was ruled out.NEVILLE KHOZA nevillek@thenewage.co.za
