Chelsea manager Antonio Conte is keen to see how his side cope with the absence of striker Diego Costa and midfielder N&#8217;Golo Kante and may change his favoured 3-4-3 formation when Bournemouth visit in the Premier League on Monday.Costa, the league&#8217;s leading scorer with 13 goals, and Kante have both featured in all of Chelsea&#8217;s league games this season, but are suspended against Bournemouth.&#8220;It is a good test for us because we play without two players who are important for our team,&#8221; Conte, whose side are six points clear at the top after an 11-game winning streak, told a news conference on Thursday.&#8220;This team showed in the past that we can play with different formations. It can be an option.&#8221;Conte would not be drawn on whether he would hand striker Michy Batshuayi his first league start since his 33 million pound ($40.77 million) move from Olympique de Marseille.&#8220;For the young player to adapt is very difficult,&#8221; Conte said. &#8220;I think Michy is working very well. We must have patience with him. The next step is to play more in this season.&#8221;Conte described his opposite number Eddie Howe, who has steered Bournemouth to 10th, as &#8220;a really good manager.&#8221;&#8220;I like him and have great respect for him&#8230;If he continues in this way he can become a manager of a great team,&#8221; he said.&#8220;I have studied Bournemouth and they are a good team with good organisation. They always try to play from the back and put on good pressure.&#8221;Conte has no injury concerns ahead of the game apart from skipper John Terry, who is still unavailable.-Reuters
