 Do you miss being the first black president, Bill Clinton was asked in an interview, to wondrous applause from the audience. I feel really honoured to be called the first black president, but I can t take credit for it. It s how my parents raised me. Of course Barrack is the first black president and I am glad he has chosen to keep me close in order to continue contributing to the progress of this country, Clinton said on the black president mantle he has worn as credited by Nobel-winning African-American author Tony Morrison.Then senator Barack Obama, answering the same question in a debate with then senator Hillary Clinton, expressed his admiration for this affinity and the special bond Clinton has with the black American community.But Obama goes further to say he is inspired by white Americans who grew up in the south, when racial segregation was at its worst, who chose to risk and lead the charge for transformation beginning with their own lives and their own little worlds, this was not only courageous but indicated the ability of people to change.Clinton s ability to identify with the black community does indeed come from growing up in a relatively poor and alienated part of hard-nosed Arkansas It s a sense of shared experience that makes him most comfortable being the only high profile white man invited to most black memorial events.However, even Clinton knows that despite the shared experience, life can be hard even if you are white, but never hard because you are white. He knows there are certain experiences he escaped because he is white and that means there are certain things he can t claim and there are certain things he can t say.South Africa could easily have been America s south. For too long, our country contained within it and represented much that is ugly and repulsive in human society.It was a place in which to be born black was to inherit a lifelong curse. It was a place that decreed that some were born into poverty and would die poor in the land of gold and diamonds and their lives would be cut short by the viral ravages of deprivation.It was a place in which squalor, the stench of poverty, the open sewers, the decaying rot, the milling crowds of wretchedness, the unending images of a landscape strewn with carelessly abandoned refuse, assumed an aspect that seemed necessary to enhance the beauty of another world of tidy streets, wooded lanes and blossoms offsetting green singing grass and birds, and houses fit for kings and queens.For too long, South Africa was a place where others always knew the accident of their birth entitled them to wealth. For 400 years, it was a place in which to live in other neighbourhoods was to enjoy safety and security because to be safe was to be protected by high walls, electrified fences, guard dogs, police patrols and military regiments ready to defend those who were our masters.Through our efforts in the past 22 years, we have achieved an outcome that is undeniable in its magnitude, we have ceased to be beggars.There is a reason to believe today racism is almost out of mainstream but now resides in the fringes of our society. This year, no South African should ever say nothing s changed when it comes to race in the country unless you ve lived through being a black man in the 50s, 60s or 70s even the 80s.Race relations have improved significantly during our lifetime. It is also true the legacy of colonialism and apartheid still casts a long shadow. We have witnessed immense cruelty this year Vanessa Hartley, who likened Africans to stupid animals, or former DA MP Dianne Kohler Barnard who retweeted a post from journalist Paul Kirk in which he praised apartheid former president PW Botha, Penny Sparrow, who referred to black beachgoers as monkeys , or Vicki Momberg who contacted the police emergency number 10111 and was recorded referring to a black police officer as a f****** k***** .High court judge Mabel Jansen in a Facebook conversation said all black men are rapists and murderers , Lodge owner Andre Slade sent an email to a patron saying his establishment Sodwana Bay Guest Lodge in KwaZulu-Natal did not accommodate black people or government employees, or DA councillor of Ward 54 Shayne Ramsay who said people living on the streets, were either criminals mentally retarded or social outcasts and those who are genuinely down on their luck , are symptomatic of the racial disparities in SA.Today, endemic and widespread poverty continues to disfigure the face of our country and continues to have a black face. It will always be impossible for us to say that we have fully restored the dignity of all our people as long as this persists. The social ills cannot be resolved outside the context of job creation.The great journey we have undertaken has to be about redressing the harm that was caused to all Africans. It is about overcoming the consequences of the assault that was made on our sense of pride, our identity and confidence in ourselves.This year, it is time that black people s position on every situation makes another leap forward, whether it s about wealth, income, jobs or affluent neighbourhoods. All fair-minded people must ask every day how we can change the condition of other citizens who are unfairly treated? We must use our human and material resources and the genius of our people to build an economy that addresses their needs.More importantly, white South Africans must open their hearts even more to racial harmony, to exorcise themselves of the fear of black people, to get rid of the old stereotypes about black people so that we can finally create this mosaic of shared experiences, overlain by diverse cultures, which will reflect in shared neighbourhoods, social gatherings, schools, sports and social networks that criss-crossed political movements and political parties.Yonela Diko is ANC Western Cape media liaison officer
