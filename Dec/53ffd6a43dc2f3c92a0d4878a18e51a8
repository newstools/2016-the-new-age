Shares in Russian oil giant Rosneft leapt over five percent Thursday after the Kremlin announced the 10.5 billion euro ($11.3 billion) sale of a stake to commodities trader Glencore and Qatar&#8217;s sovereign fund.President Vladimir Putin late Wednesday hailed the deal for 19.5 percent of the state-controlled firm as the largest in the global energy sector for 2016, a major fillip for the authorities as they seek to plug the country&#8217;s growing deficit.The deal is part of a broader privatisation drive and comes despite Moscow being mired in Western sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine that have played a major part in plunging the country into recession. Rosneft stock was up some 5.43 percent by 0730 GMT on the Moscow Exchange to 375.6 rubles ($5.9, 5.5 euros), hiking the company&#8217;s overall valuation to some 58 billion euros.Swiss-based commodities giant Glencore and the sovereign fund of gas-rich emirate Qatar will go fifty-fifty on the deal, which leaves the Russian state controlling just over 50 percent of the country&#8217;s largest oil firm.Rosneft chief Igor Sechin told Putin that Rosneft had taken part in talks with &#8220;more than 30 companies, funds, professional investors, sovereign funds, financial institutions from countries in Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region&#8221; ahead of the deal.The final agreement is being partly funded by a cash from &#8220;one of the major European banks&#8221;, he said, without naming the lender.The move comes after oil prices have risen to more than $50 a barrel after OPEC members last week hammered out a deal to cut oil output for the first time in eight years.Glencore said in a statement that the deal &#8220;will be conditional on the subsequent finalisation of all relevant financing, guarantee and other agreements,&#8221; and could be closed in mid-December.-REUTERS
