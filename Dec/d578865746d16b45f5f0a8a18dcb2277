A big name on film and TV, Adam Driver stars in a less flashy project, Jim Jarmusch&#8217;s &#8220;Paterson,&#8221; but it&#8217;s one that has attracted no small amount of praise during an extended run of cinephile film festivals. &#8211; Who&#8217;s in it and what&#8217;s it about? &#8211;Adam Driver is best known for his ongoing six-season run as Adam Sackler in HBO comedy series &#8220;Girls&#8221; and as twisted Jedi knight Kylo Ren in &#8220;Star Wars: Episode VII &#8211; The Force Awakens.&#8221;Here he teams up with one of US cinema&#8217;s most established and active auteurs in director Jim Jarmusch, playing the lead and title role in &#8220;Paterson.&#8221;Paterson is an unpublished but serial poet whose day job is as a bus driver, ferrying his passengers around the city with which he shares his name, Paterson, and by nature of his proximity, gleaning insights into the lives of those that ride the buses.It&#8217;s an examination of the everyday, the regular habits of a working man, and a meditation on what is right with the world. There might not be conflict but there is plenty of comedy written into Paterson&#8217;s conversations with his wife, colleagues, barman, passengers, and passers by. Sometimes even fellow poets.Golshifteh Farahani, who has featured in Ridley Scott&#8217;s &#8220;Body of Lies&#8221; and &#8220;Exodus: Gods and Kings,&#8221; plays Paterson&#8217;s wife Laura.
