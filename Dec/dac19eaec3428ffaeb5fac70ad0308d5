Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday vowed to retain the country&#8217;s vice president until her term ends, just days after she resigned from the cabinet, complaining of a &#8220;plot to steal&#8221; her position.Vice President Leni Robredo resigned from the cabinet on Monday, saying she would lead the opposition and challenge Duterte&#8217;s policies, such as his deadly war on drugs and moves to reinstate the death penalty.&#8220;I will assure Leni and the rest of the Bicol region that you will have her until the very end of this term,&#8221; Duterte told reporters after a ceremony to break ground for an airport in the central region of Bicol.&#8220;And there is no such thing as removing a vice president.&#8221;Robredo was a one-term congresswoman from Naga City, located in Bicol.In earlier speeches, Duterte has accused the opposition of using street protests against the burial of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a heroes&#8217; cemetery as a pretext to force him out of office and make way for Robredo.Robredo was elected vice president in May in a separate contest and was not Duterte&#8217;s running mate. She has warned of a plot taking shape to remove her from the number two post after she was barred from attending regular cabinet meetings.The 52 year-old social activist and human rights lawyer won by a narrow margin over former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr, whose father was overthrown in a 1986 revolt. He has filed an election protest.Robredo did not give details of the alleged plot to &#8220;steal&#8221; the vice presidency, but said it was telling that Marcos had accompanied Duterte on an official visit to China in October.&nbsp;-Reuters
