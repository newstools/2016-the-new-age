THERE was a time when motswako rapper Tuks Senganga, real name Tumelo Kepadisa, was the country s leading and most influential Tswana rapper, with hits such as 525 600 Minutes, Mafoko A Me, Bona Fela, Monate Thwaa and many more creating waves.The fast rapping lyrical genius has over the years released five albums. In recent times, though, his steam seemed to have taken a knock with a new breed of rappers taking over the spot from veterans such as him, forcing him to play catch up with the changing pace of the SA rap game.Tuks, who recently re-emerged at the Maftown Heights event over two weeks ago, said he had to take things easy in order to be able to come back and take charge of his music.That has resulted in him putting out single after single ahead of the recent release of his fifth studio album, Botshe Botshe, a 13 track offering dominated by his socially relevant Tswana raps also known as motswako rap. I have released a couple of singles from my new album Botshe Botshe, Tuks said. The album is a way for me to pay homage to my home town Mahikeng. I have a far more clear understanding of myself and my music. I have more knowledge about myself than I have had in the past and I know as a result of this that I have grown. Having began his rap writing career as a teen, Tuks normally draws inspiration from everyday issues and daily occurrences in his immediate environment.That has not changed with most of the tracks on the album. The album features songs in collaboration with fellow motswako rappers such as Mo Molemi, KayGizm and many others to add to a diverse and well-balanced creative production.Listening to most of the tracks on the album one has a sense that Tuks is back to his fine form which ranges from opening track Treasures In The Booth to the musically charged A Ko Butle with fellow wizards all the way to the familiar clips in motswako Atlelete, Kganya sealed In Hope and Hello Pita and many others.As one of the early hip hop artists, Tuks is a veteran of this sub-genre made popular by his fellow Mafikeng natives such as HHP, Khuli Chana, Mo Molemi, Stoan Seate and others. Motswako is almost at the driving seat of SA hip hop culture and we are happy that we as the artists have contributed to that growth of the genre and industry in general.The good thing is that we have managed through motswako to keep it moving with a new breed of motswako rappers such as Fifi Cooper and Cassper Nyovest currently holding it down, he said.Tuks said the biggest lesson he learnt in his musical career was that leaders did not enjoy the fruits of their labour. Leaders who lay the foundation for others do not live long enough to enjoy what they have helped create, he said.-siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
