Lesotho nationals in Bloemfontein and Welkom are murdering each other for dominance, yet deny gang warfareA spate of murders has taken its toll on the Lesotho citizens in Bloemfontein and Welkom.This was revealed by some of the Lesotho nationals living in the province who wanted to remain anonymous as they feared for their lives.They said they were fighting for the dominance of the colour of their blankets and the silent war started in Lesotho and crossed over into the country.Lesotho citizens in the country are killing each other. Some of them said there was a silent war between the groups but they denied being in gangs.They said those groups were formed many years ago to help underprivileged people in their areas.Even though those murders are less frequent in Bloemfontein, in Welkom they are still continuing and worse, are allegedly carried out by illegal miners (zama-zamas).Almost every week, the police in Welkom report the murder of Lesotho nationals.The New Age went to find out more from Lesotho citizens who are living in the province.A 35-year-old man who wanted to remain anonymous denied the groups were gangs and said they were formed many years ago to take care of less fortunate people in their areas. They were formed to raise funds and help each other on their land should there be a drought or if they struggled. They wear different coloured blankets but each group wears the same type of blanket and it s now alleged they are fighting over those blankets, he said.A man who once belonged to one of the groups, said other groups wanted to dominate and their type of blanket must be seen everywhere.A 27-year-old woman said the reason why they are killing each other might be that they are jealous of each other as they were mostly small traders. This has been created out of jealousy by young people using the groups names and now it s alleged there will be more revenge, the woman said.However, the police denied the murders were a silent gang-related war but they were investigating.They also asked anyone who knew anything about these murders to come forward and provide information.The provincial deputy chairperson of the community policing forum (CPF), Joseph Sebela, said the crime and the killing of Lesotho people had been of great concern, not only to the police but also to them.He said they were working with the police who assured them the perpetrators would be brought to book and that they were searching for the culprits. Many arrests were made but there are some still at large and they may continue with the killings, so we are pleading with our people, wherever they are, to please work with us and the police to deal with these murders. Even though they are less frequent, the CPF and the police cannot fight murders alone. Members of the public can help us stop crime in their areas, Sebela said.He said they are saying life was very important to everyone and they deserved to live and not be killed. We will be embarking on a crime awareness campaign in Phuthaditjhaba in QwaQwa next Wednesday, when the Deputy Minister of Police Maggy Sotyu will be in attendance, Sebela said.-BECKER SEMELA
