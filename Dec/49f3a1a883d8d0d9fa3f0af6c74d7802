The finance ministry s decision to decline a request to place the Mpumalanga provincial government under administration in terms of Section 100 of the Constitution has been welcomed by finance, economic development and tourism MEC Sikhumbuzo Kholwane.This decision follows the submission of a petition to Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on October 28 wherein the Economic Freedom Front (EFF) in Mpumalanga raised issues with the financial administration of the provincial government.Gordhan clarified the conditions that may necessitate a provincial government be placed under administration and found that such a condition did not exist.Kholwane said he agreed with the ministry s assertion that the issues raised by the EFF did not constitute a failure by the province to fulfil its obligations in terms of the Section 100 (1) (a) or 100 (1) (b) of the Constitution.In his response to the EFF, Gordhan also highlighted the success of some of the provincial government s interventions in financial administration. Despite the dire fiscal conditions of the country, the province has excelled in areas such as cash management and ensuring sufficient minimal cash flow which allowed the departments to honour their transactional obligations, Gordhan said.Kholwane said the provincial treasury department would continue to address supply chain challenges by capacitating the officials on effective implementation of the legislative prescripts, strengthening contract management and assisting the suppliers whose valid invoices were not paid within the prescribed 30 days. An audit improvement plan has been finalised and it covers all departments and public entities, including the four departments and public entities that received clean audit outcomes in the regulatory audit of the PFMA institutions in the 2015-16 financial year, Kholwane said. The interim audit process for 10 auditees (departments and public entities) which form part of the measures to improve financial management and consequently the audit outcomes of the province has also commenced.
