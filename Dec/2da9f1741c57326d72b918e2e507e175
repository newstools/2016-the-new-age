The court tasked with validating the impeachment of South Korean President Park Geun-Hye said Friday that she would not be required to appear for questioning.But the Constitutional Court said Park&#8217;s close friend Choi Soon-Sil, the media-dubbed &#8220;Rasputin&#8221; at the centre of the corruption scandal that triggered the president&#8217;s downfall, must submit for questioning on January 10.The National Assembly, which passed a motion to impeach Park earlier this month, had asked the court to summon Park and question her directly.&#8220;The request &#8230; is rejected,&#8221; the court said.The court has 180 days to consider parliament&#8217;s impeachment motion and its president Park Han-Chul said in a New Year message that it would seek to make a decision &#8220;at an early date&#8221;.If the impeachment is confirmed, a presidential election will have to be held within 60 days.Park is accused of colluding with Choi to strong-arm companies into handing over tens of millions of dollars to dubious foundations which Choi controlled.Choi has been formally indicted on charges of abuse of power and extortion.-AFP
