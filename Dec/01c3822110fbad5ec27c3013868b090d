The provincial department of public works, roads and transport has vowed to remain merciless on vehicles such as minibuses and buses transporting people to different destinations without relevant documentation this festive season.Transport inspectorate officers will be deployed on the provincial roads to ensure that all the transporting vehicles were complied with the traffic rules in terms of operating documentation.Public works, roads and transport spokesperson David Nkambule said transport operators operating on the roads outside their jurisdiction of operation needed to apply for temporary permits.Nkambule said the action was part of their mandate to promote safer transport. The department s transport inspectorate unit with other law enforcement agencies will carry out several campaigns to ensure the safety of all road users. Furthermore, inspectors will be checking if public transport operators are carrying the valid temporary operating licences and their driver s licenses when ferrying passengers. Operators are urged to apply for temporary operating licences if they will be taking special trips ferrying passengers on routes which are outside their operating licences during this festive period, Nkambule said.He said motorists also needed to exercise patience to avoid accidents as the majority of the provincial roads were under construction.The roads disturbing traffic flow include the R36 between Breyton and Ermelo, P53/2 between Leandra and Standerton and R542 between Van Dyksdrift and Hendrina.France Nyaka| francen@thenewage.co.za
