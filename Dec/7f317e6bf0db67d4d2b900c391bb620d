Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has hailed the year 2016 as a period of successful engagement between the executive and the legislature.Wearing his leader of government business hat, Ramaphosa released his 2016 parliamentary review yesterday.Ramaphosa said the engagements he referred to underscored the growing strength and integrity of South Africa s system of democratic governance .He said the sharp growth in parliamentary questions and the selection of a new public protector to succeed Thuli Madonsela was evidence of the transparency and accountability, in which government responds to the hopes and aspirations of the electorate .Parliament was the place where members of the executive individually and collectively accounted to South Africans about the pace of transformation to ensure a better quality of life for all, Ramaphosa said. Good relations between the Executive and Parliament were key to protecting South Africa s democratic system while sound intergovernmental relations substantially enhanced responsiveness by the state to the needs of citizens, Ramaphosa said.He said there had been a significant improvement in the responses of members of the executive to oral and written questions. Members of the executive are acutely aware of the importance of Parliament s oversight of the exercise of the national executive authority and of the organ of state, and the role that tools such as parliamentary questions play in such oversight. This is a matter constantly raised and discussed in Cabinet meetings, Ramaphosa said.According to parliamentary records, he said, in the case of oral questions, relevant ministers were present in 77% of cases to answer questions. In 22% percent of cases either the deputy minister or acting minister was present.The rate of reply has grown from 2000 replies to written questions in 2009 to more than 4000 last year. Each year, the proportion of written questions answered has risen to more than 95%.Ramaphosa said the government welcomed the provisions in the new rules of the National Assembly to monitor replies to questions. Should Parliament determine that members of the executive are not responding sufficiently or promptly to matters raised in Parliament, it may wish to consider taking appropriate action against ministers. On bills, he said there were 20 executive bills before the National Assembly s Portfolio Committees. They include the Liquor Products Amendment Bill, the Broadcasting Amendment Bill, Border Management Authority Bill and the Foreign Service Bill.Dennis Cruywagennews@thenewage.co.za
