Instead of letting their Telkom Knockout final defeat by Cape Town City get them down, SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter is looking for an immediate response from his side.Top of the list is the objective to finish the year on a high note before the Christmas recess.United saw their 14-match unbeaten run cut short on Saturday by new kids on the block City, who beat them 2-1 at Peter Mokaba Stadium.Baxter, however, admitted that his side let themselves down. The unbeaten run has to come to an end sometime, Baxter said. I think the lads are hurt but they are professionals. They will pick themselves up for the next game, and let us see if we can finish the year on a positive note. Matsatsantsa a Pitori will meet City again on Friday in a Premiership league match in which the Tshwane side will do everything in their power to redeem themselves.Supersport are second on the log three points behind the newly crowned Telkom Knockout champions. I think this may fire them up a little bit for the away game in Cape Town, Baxter said. We didn t play well in their box in the first half to gain the momentum we wanted to. The momentum swung to them when we kept losing the ball and they could get their heads up and ping the ball over our backline. The back four got frustrated and they dropped off. The game became a bit stretched and we didn t want it that way. We wanted to be compact to get people to the ball and to get them to make forward runs. When we get stretched like that, I thought everything for us was slow. I thought we played better in the second half. We shifted the ball better. Baxter also said striker Jeremy Brockie, who was substituted in the second half due to injury, was likely to be out for an extended period of time.Brockie played the final carrying an injury, with Baxter taking a gamble to play him.NEVILLE KHOZAnevillek@thenewage.co.za
