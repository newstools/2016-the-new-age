Clashes erupted between Syrian government forces and opposition fighters in an area outside Damascus on Friday, despite a nationwide truce that began at midnight, a monitor said.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not clear who had started the clashes in the Wadi Barada region.&#8220;Clashes erupted and are continuing&#8230; in Wadi Barada near Damascus, with helicopters firing on positions belonging to the opposition and Fateh al-Sham Front,&#8221; Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said.Fateh al-Sham Front is the former Al-Qaeda affiliate previously known as Al-Nusra Front, which Syria&#8217;s government said was excluded from the truce that began early Friday.Syria&#8217;s opposition however have said they understood the truce to apply to all of Syria, including areas where Fateh al-Sham is present.Abdel Rahman said the clashes were a &#8220;violation of the truce, but it is not clear which party is responsible for starting it.&#8221;A resident of the area confirmed to AFP that he could hear heavy shelling on Friday morning.Syria&#8217;s government says rebels in Wadi Barada, northwest of the capital, deliberately targeted water infrastructure that supplies the capital last week.The damage in Wadi Barada and neighbouring Ain al-Fijeh has created severe water shortages in Damascus.The UN said Thursday that four million people in Damascus and surrounding suburbs were now without water.&#8220;People around Damascus have been without access to water in their homes for more than a week and are having to purchase water from private vendors, where prices and water quality are unregulated,&#8221; the UN said.The Observatory said rebels targeted the water facilities in response to stepped up regime strikes on the area as the government tries to impose a &#8220;reconciliation deal&#8221; on the region.Over the past five months alone, such agreements have seen at least six towns around Damascus evacuated, with rebels, their families and other civilians bused to other opposition-held areas in northern Syria.A nationwide truce brokered by Russia and Turkey came into force at midnight, and has largely held despite minor incidents elsewhere in the country.&nbsp;-AFP
