The R68m rehabilitation centre to be built in the gang-infested Botshabelo township, about 50km east of Bloemfontein, is expected to be a saving grace for the community ravaged by substance abuse.The provincial social development department made the announcement earlier this year, saying this first staterun rehabilitation centre should be completed next year.Whether the centre will make up for the lack of legislation for those dealing in the latest drug of choice nyaope is another matter.But the department is confident the centre will get many of the youths who find themselves in the shackles of drugs and alcoholism, freed.The department has taken a decision to reprioritise substance abuse and youth development because it realised that there was a rise in substance abuse in the province and so demand for prevention and treatment is growing.Botshabelo is one of the towns that have experienced a sharp increase in gang violence as a direct result of substance abuse, mainly nyaope.Nyaope addicts turn to crime and even steal valuables from their families to feed the habit that costs a measly R30 a dose but users need several doses a day to stay high.Dealers are known to add all sorts of stuff to bulk out the concoction, including dagga, antiretroviral drugs, heroin and rat poison at times.Dr David Bayever from the government drug control organisation, known as CDA, said at least 15% of South Africans have a drug problem. And a recently-released UN world drug report named South Africa as one of the drug capitals of the world.A mother who lost a daughter has complained about the abandonment of a bill that would have ensured nyaope is classified as an illegal substance and those see found guilty of possession or dealing in the drug prosecuted and given stiff sentences.The bill has been sitting in the in tray since 2013 and is seemingly forgotten while thousands of young South Africans battle with nyaope addiction. The failure to classify nyaope as an illegal substance is fuelling devastation in already impoverished townships. A lot of our children are addicted to this poison, the mother said.Martha Dean, who buried her 24-year-old daughter, Bonita, in September said a lot could be done from the government s side. Bonita died after a long struggle with drug addiction and her mother had to pay R50000 in an effort to rehabilitate her. Bonita really struggled with drugs till the day she died, even when I tried to put her in rehabilitation centres it did not help, she said.However, National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku defended the neglect of the bill saying possession of any of the ingredients in nyaope or whoonga was unlawful. Once traces of illegal substances are established, we prosecute, Mfaku said. Social development spokesperson Thebe Mohatle said they were concerned with the broader challenge of addressing the scourge of substance abuse, alcohol and other social ills that impacted all sectors of communities. Ours is therefore not to focus on one specific drug, but on ensuring that communities are protected and spared from the proliferation of other substances.This we achieve through an integrated strategy that involves participation from all sectors of our community, Mohatle said.He said the use and abuse of drugs was universal, therefore he could not say they were used differently in different regions. The Gauteng Anti Substance Abuse Social Movement and the Ke Moja programmes are some of the activities that Gauteng has successfully launched in response to the tenets of the national drug master plan, Mohatle said.The South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (Sanca) director, Terrence Makananisa, said a hindrance to the fight against drugs was the shortage of rehabilitation centres in the country and that family support was also lacking. It is mostly the rural areas that struggle with not having centres. For instance, Limpopo just recently got its first centre in Seshego, Makananisa said. Family members dump their loved ones and will only visit when there is a problem. With family support the recovery rate of most patients would be faster. More than 300 people took part in the anti-drug campaign in Rosettenville, Johannesburg, in September, and a spokesperson for the marchers, Virgil James for the city of Joburg, said that the 5.2km march was a success and communities were engaged on the dangers of drug abuse. The city will not allow nyaope to be available openly, James said, adding that the fight to eradicate drugs needs a united effort including the presence of NGOs in this battle.According to SAPS figures, 60% of crimes committed nationally were related to substance abuse. In the Western Cape, the figure was closer to 80%.The perpetrators of these crimes are either under the influence of substances, or trying to secure money for their next fix.Drug statistics show that 25000 people die annually from smoking-related illnesses in SA.According to the Cancer Association of SA, 2.5 million workdays are lost in SA due to absenteeism from tobacco-related illnesses.newsdesk@thenewage.co.za
