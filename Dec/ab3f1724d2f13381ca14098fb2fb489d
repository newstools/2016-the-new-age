The Hawks are not responsible for initiating charges against people, they only investigate cases brought to them, Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said on Tuesday .His utterances follow Independent Police Investigative Directorate&#8217;s (IPID) statements accusing Hawks of having an agenda against its head. There is nothing sinister in the matter. It is a normal procedure for us (Hawks) to ask anyone that is being investigated to submit written statement, Mulaudzi added.However Mulaudzi on Tuesday said Yesterday(Monday ) McBride was supposed to meet up with the Hawks, but he instead sent his lawyers on his behalf, which we did not have a problem with but what was disturbing was the fact that all the matters we were dealing with were all in the media. -TNA Reporter
