Mercedes&#8217; upcoming flagship supercar, the Mercedes-AMG GT-R, has just set a remarkable N rburgring Nordschleife lap time of 7 minutes, 10.92 seconds.The official time, the fastest ever recorded by German publication &#8220;sport auto&#8221; when testing a genuine road-going sports car on the notorious track, also ranks as the seventh fastest in history around the infamous 20km circuit.To put its time, also confirmed as the fasted achieved by a rear-wheel drive only car, into some sort of perspective, the much more potent 488 GTB needed 7 minutes and 21.6 seconds to get all the way around the circuit.Yet the GT-R, on paper, shouldn&#8217;t be so rapid. Its bi-turbo V8 engine outputs 585hp and 700Nm of torque and can accelerate from 0-100km/h in 3.6 seconds. The Ferrari 488 serves up 661bhp and can race to 100km/h in 3.0 seconds.But unlike the 448, this Mercedes lived at the Nurburgring during its development. And it was on that track that the company&#8217;s engineers and technicians attempted to transfer as much current generation racing technology derived from Formula 1 and GT3 competition as possible into the car.&#8220;With the new AMG GT R, we have reached the next level of driving performance. This road-going sports car with motor-racing genes and innovative technical solutions offers an ultimate driving experience that allows people to feel our motorsport origins in every fibre,&#8221; said Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes AMG GmbH.It boasts innovations such as active aerodynamics that make the car slippery when going in a straight line or massively increase downforce when cornering at speed.In this regard it&#8217;s the first road-going car to use an active under-floor panel that moves back and forward to channel how air flows under the car at different speeds.&#8220;Our sports-car and performance brand AMG has its roots in motorsport and, ever since its formation, has repeatedly faced up to the competition on the racetrack,&#8221; said Prof.Thomas Weber, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Group Research and Mercedes Benz Cars Development. &#8220;[This] new top-of-the-range model is proof of the close collaboration between our constructors of racing cars and road-going vehicles.&#8221;The record time comes just as the GT-R officially goes on sale. The first deliveries are expected in March and, unlike the equivalent Ferrari, Mercedes has no plans to cap production numbers, meaning that anyone with around $200,000 can have one.-Relaxnews
