Volvo&#8217;s dedicated tuning and racing arm, Polestar, has decided that the new V90 Cross Country station wagon cum SUV is in need of a performance boost.Rather than a dedicated &#8220;hot&#8221; variant, when you go to specify a new Cross Country, you&#8217;ll be able to select a Polestar performance upgrade pack on the model&#8217;s existing engine with tweaks available for the T6, D5 and D4 models.However, regardless of a gasoline or diesel engine, Polestar claims that owners will notice the difference without having to head out to the closest racing circuit.&#8220;Our focus is as always on creating usable performance, just as when we develop our racing cars to win championships,&#8221; said Polestar Touring Car race driver Thed Bj rk. So the cars are tuned to offer more feedback and response at mid-range, such as for getting away from danger quickly, accelerating to overtake or to join a highway.&#8220;[We treat] the entire powertrain, including engine, gearbox, throttle response and more, as one unit when developing our optimizations,&#8221; said Bj rk.In other words, a Polestar Volvo shouldn&#8217;t just feel more spritely in a straight line.Since its financial reinvigoration thanks to new Chinese backers, Volvo has been building cars that can go toe to toe with the best premium products coming out of Germany in terms of styling, luxury and practicality.And now by bringing its Polestar racing division closer to its core cars, it is starting to fill in the gaps in its range that are missing when looking at AMG tuned Mercedes, M-badged BMWs and Audi&#8217;s ever expanding S and RS variants.&#8220;To include the V90 Cross Country, a true adventure crossover, in our optimization program is a vital part of our operation,&#8221; said Niels M ller, Chief Operating Officer of Polestar. &#8220;Our product provides performance-oriented customers with a new level of driving pleasure.&#8221;-Relaxnews
