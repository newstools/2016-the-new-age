A film producer in Mpumalanga, Vusi Magagula, urges young filmmakers to effectively use the social media in order to market their products.Magagula said it was about time filmmakers conceded that the film industry would do better when they used the internet to reach their audience.He is the multi-award-winning producer who has produced a number of movies and documentaries. Recently he won two pertinent awards at the Sunshine Media Awards that were held at the Sydney Choma Banquet Hall in Middelburg. I m not saying the traditional way of making movies is fading away. I am just saying that we should consider taking advantage of the new media which is the easiest way to reach our target audience without any hustle. I have seen many overseas filmmakers producing short movies and upload them on YouTube and reach a huge audience. Using this kind of platform is much easier and less expensive, Magagula said.Magagula, who has been in the film industry for many years, said producing the award-winning documentary based on a series of protests that took place at Ehlanzeni TVET college, Mapulaneng Campus, was one of his career highlights. The documentary also got an official selection on the Jozi Film Festival this year.In the past, Magagula has also won a number of awards, which include best film and best producer, which he received in 2014.Magagula is the founder of Long Tape African Indies Film Festival and Mifa Academy, a film school based in Acornhoek, Bushbuckridge, where he assists the youth to pursue careers in the film industry.He acquired his film production qualification at the film production programme organised by the SABC in Johannesburg in 2004, that was nominated more than 15 times at the short films competitions nationally.provinces@thenewage.co.za
