MORE than 500 people have been arrested in Gauteng for domestic violence and sexual assault last month. In the last financial year, Gauteng saw more than 9000 sexual offence cases reported to the cops. Police spokesperson Lt-Col Lungelo Dlamini said they unfortunately expect these case numbers to rise in the festive season due to alcohol abuse. Out of the total arrests in November, 258 suspects were arrested for sexual assault cases that includes rape, exposing children to child pornography, abduction, sexual grooming of a mentally disabled person and enticing them to engage in sexual activity. All of those suspects are facing criminal proceedings in various magistrate s courts, he said. Dlamini said that the domestic violence arrests were effected for contravention of various prohibitions, particularly firearm prohibitions, violation of protection orders, publication of information that discloses the identity of the parties involved in domestic violence proceedings, abuse and deliberate neglect of children, and exposing children to sexual acts. However, the arrests made are thought to represent just a fraction of sexual and gender based violence in Gauteng. Police are appealing to victims to report any form of domestic violence as it leads to more serious and violent crime including rape, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, attempted murder and murder. Victims that are most affected are children, women and the elderly. Dlamini said that 638 people were arrested for assault this month, 347 for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, 196 for malicious damage to property and 15 for murder. During stop and search operations in Moffatview, Jeppe and Nellmapius, police searched suspicious people and vehicles. Unlicensed pistols were seized and 16 suspects were arrested. Police are appealing to members of the community to report any suspicious vehicles and people, Dlamini said.batandwam@thenewage.co.za-Batandwa Malingo
