Danny Drinkwater and Riyad Mahrez are likely to start for Leicester City against West Ham United in Saturday&#8217;s Premier League clash, manager Claudio Ranieri has indicated.The Italian is turning to two of last season&#8217;s most influential figures in a bid to arrest the champions&#8217; alarming slide towards the relegation zone.Drinkwater made his first league appearance in more than a month as a second-half substitute in Monday&#8217;s 2-0 home defeat by Everton, a result that dropped Leicester to 16th place, three points above the bottom three.&#8220;Drinkwater could be (in the starting line-up) because he played 45 minutes (against Everton),&#8221; Ranieri told a news conference on Thursday.&#8220;He works well and I think he could start from the beginning.&#8221;Mahrez was dropped to the bench against Everton because Ranieri said he felt the Algerian winger needed a rest.But the manager is now looking for a creative spark to prevent a third straight game without a win.&#8220;I watched him during the training session last week and he was a little tired. He worked so hard, 10 men verses 11 at Stoke,&#8221; the manager added.&#8220;I decided to give him a little rest and I want to see his reaction. Now he feels better. I am waiting for a very good reaction.&#8220;I am the manager, I have to chose the right moment to give him a rest. Players are not a machine you can put a coin in and they work.&#8221;Jamie Vardy was sent off in the 2-2 draw with Stoke and is again suspended against a West Ham side whose three successive victories have pushed them up to 11th.Not for the first time this season, Ranieri called on his players for a reaction, urging them to play without fear and get the crucial three points.&#8220;We are unhappy, no one is happy. The chairman, me, the sporting director, the staff, the players, we have to react. As soon as possible,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We are the Foxes and the Foxes are fearless. We know very well we are in the battle and we are ready to fight.&#8220;We want to reach 20 points, we have to win against West Ham. We need points and we will fight. In life there are good moments and bad moments. I want to see how my players react to the bad moments.&#8221;-Reuters
