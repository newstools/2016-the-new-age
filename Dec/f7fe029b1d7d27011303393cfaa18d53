Nothing will be better than three points for SuperSport United as consolation for their Telkom Knockout disappointment last week to Cape Town City when they face the same team tomorrow at Athlone Stadium in a league match.City was responsible for SuperSport not laying their hands on the knockout competition title with a 2-1 win.Tomorrow, United travel to Cape Town to face the same team, this time in the Absa Premiership match with revenge definitely on their minds.Added to that, Matsatsantsa a Pitori will be fully aware that a victory will also see them go to the summit of the log. They will be equal with City on 24 points but have a superior goal difference.It is something they are definitely thinking about after their disappointment of losing the final to the PSL s surprise package.Eric Tinkler s charges were thumped 4-0 by Platinum Stars earlier in the week and that will give Matsatsantsa a Pitori a chance of going top of the log should they register a win.But captain Clayton Daniels expects another tough encounter against a side which defeated them in the final. The cup final is water under the bridge. The focus is on the two crucial matches, one on the road and the second game at home, Daniels said. We are travelling to Cape Town obviously going to be a grudge match looking at last weekend s result. This is going to be a different encounter and we are looking forward to settling the score. Daniels said they would approach this match differently than the cup final as they aim to collect all three points to move top of the log. We chased the score for a long time in the final and City were hard to penetrate at some point, Daniels said. We had nothing to lose that is why we pushed forward for an equaliser. Unfortunately, it wasn t our day and hopefully this time we will come out victorious. NEVILLE KHOZAnevillek@newage.co.za
