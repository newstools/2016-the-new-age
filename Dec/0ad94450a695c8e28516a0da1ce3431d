Kashima Antlers became the first Japanese side to reach the Club World Cup final when they beat Colombia&#8217;s South American champions Atletico Nacional 3-0 on Wednesday.Kashima&#8217;s first goal came after 33 minutes when Shoma Doi converted a penalty given for an off-the-ball trip after video evidence was used for the first time to award a spot kick.Yasushi Endo scored the Antlers&#8217; second after 83 minutes when he took advantage of an error by goalkeeper Franco Armani to backheel a loose ball into the empty net.Atletico&#8217;s heads went down and two minutes later substitute Yuma Suzuki, who had just come on, sidefooted home a third from close range after Mu Kanazaki&#8217;s ball across the face of goal.The result means the Japanese champions will face the winners of Thursday&#8217;s semi-final between Real Madrid and Mexico&#8217;s Club America. The final is scheduled for Sunday.-Reuters
