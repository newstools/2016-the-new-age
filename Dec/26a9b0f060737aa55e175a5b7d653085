Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle will tomorrow deliver a keynote address at the official opening of Walter Sisulu University s new (WSU) R85m health sciences facility at the Mthatha Hospital Complex.Masualle is expected to speak on the government s numerous other initiatives, together with WSU, as part of the ongoing mandate to improve health care in the province.The state-of-the-art facility, funded by the Department of Higher Education s Infrastructure and Efficiency Fund and the Clinical Fund, is aimed at improving and increasing the university s medical research and academic output. This world-class campus will house and educate 2000 medical students who can effectively respond to the region s local conditions. We want to do more in responding to the needs of the communities we serve, WSU health sciences dean Dr Wezile Chitha said.Chitha said eventually all health science operations would be migrated to the new faculty housed at the Mthatha Hospital Complex.He said the project is critical to consolidating and controlling operations, and creating cohesion for the faculty that will lead to favourable conditions for maximum academic performance and research output. The university is one of world s top eight medical faculties in problem-based community learning. With the faculty being strategically positioned and in close proximity to the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital and the university s Health Resource Centre, operations such as administration, research, teaching and learning and training will be seamless. We will be able maintain the standard we ve set, Chitha said.The university s spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo said that the project will be constructed in three phases.The first phase, which has just been completed, includes bulk services infrastructure, earthworks, an administration building, a teaching facility for 600 students and a gatehouse.The administration building is a 4 500m double-storey structure that will house six clinical offices and 14 smaller clinical offices with two large boardrooms.The teaching facility is a 1 350m double storey building that will be the focal point when entering the campus.On the ground floor, the building will house 10 lecture halls which will be able to accommodate 60 students each.The first floor will comprise 20 smaller tutorial rooms. The building s design is modern and true to its time, region and context with significant elegance. Most importantly, the buildings are designed for a flourishing and ideal teaching and learning environment, Chitha said.Phase two of the project will see the construction of residences, an auditorium, a research lab, a library, computer labs, student common rooms and a campus cafeteria.Construction on the last phase of the facility will include more residences and another auditorium, along with campus shops, teaching facilities and health sciences departments.Tukwayo said the latest development is a clear indication of the strides being gained by the university to help deal with the burden of diseases that are confronting our people. One of the major focuses of such efforts is to create infrastructure that allows for a conducive and appropriate living, working and teaching and learning environment for our staff and students, Tukwayo said. Through this project, we are honouring these deliverables so we can produce quality graduates equipped with the necessary tools to help improve and add value to the community. This comes as patients in the Eastern Cape are bearing the brunt of a chronic shortage of health practitioners including doctors and nurses.Huge staff shortages and weak primary care are the two most pressing problems for the province and poor patients who solely depend on the state health care system are the ones who feel the pinch the most.As a result, claims of negligence and the province s litigation battles now total R876m and range from children blinded at birth to pensioners dying from infections which their families claimed they acquired at hospitals.Other dignitaries set to grace the occasion include AbaThembu King Azenathi Dalindyebo, OR Tambo district municipality and King Sabata Dalindyebo executive mayors Nomakhosazana Meth and Nonkoliso Ngqongwa, health MEC Dr Phumza Dyantyi, as well as one of the medical school s founding deans Prof Marina XabaMokoena.INDIE BOYCEindiphileb@thenewage.co.za
