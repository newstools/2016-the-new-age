Arsene Wenger has labelled Chelsea as &#8216;super-favourites&#8217; for the Premier League title after watching the leaders close in on Arsenal&#8217;s record for consecutive victories.Antonio Conte&#8217;s side have opened up a six-point lead at the top of the table thanks to a superb run of 12 successive wins.Chelsea have been perfect in the league since a 3-0 defeat at Arsenal on September 24 led to a change in formation from Blues boss ConteThe west Londoners can consolidate pole position in this weekend&#8217;s clash with Stoke and Gunners manager Wenger conceded on Friday they are firm favourites to take the title.&#8220;At the moment Chelsea are the super-favourites because they are quite big and made a big difference,&#8221; Wenger said.&#8220;But it is theirs to lose as we say here in England. They can still lose it, at the moment they have won it but they can still lose it.&#8220;It&#8217;s still a long way to go and very difficult for everybody so the head-to-head (matches) will have a vital importance.&#8220;They have addressed their problems well. You have to give credit to Conte to find a solution that has balanced well his team.&#8220;They bought David Luiz who stabilised their defensive record and I think overall they are the team that has been the most consistent until now.&#8221;Arsenal won 13 consecutive Premier League games on their way to the title in 2001-02, extending the run to 14 the following campaign, but Wenger says he would do nothing but congratulate Chelsea if they match their single-season run.&#8220;What they do is fantastic,&#8221; he added. &#8220;If they do it, it&#8217;s absolutely marvellous because nobody expected that.&#8220;At the start of the season, they had a little bit of a dodgy start, but after, since they&#8217;ve changed their system, they are on a run where the confidence plays a big part.&#8220;If they do it, you can only say &#8216;well done&#8217;. Record are there to be beaten and if somebody does better than you, you have to acknowledge it and say &#8216;well done&#8217;.&#8221;&#8211;AFP
