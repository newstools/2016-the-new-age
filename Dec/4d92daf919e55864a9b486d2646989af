Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka will forget about friendship to focus on outwitting his mentor Jose Mourinho when his team face a resurgent Manchester United at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Saturday.Karanka was Mourinho&#8217;s assistant at Real Madrid from 2010 to 2013 and credited the Portuguese with helping him take his first steps in management, but insisted that 14th-placed Middlesbrough would do all they could to disrupt United&#8217;s nine-game unbeaten run.&#8220;This is one of the fixtures I was looking forward to most. I have a lot to thank Jose Mourinho for,&#8221; Karanka told a news conference on Thursday.&#8220;It will be a special moment for me and for the team, but it is football, and three important points to play for. In those 90 minutes you can&#8217;t be friends.&#8221;&#8220;I spent three amazing years with him at Madrid. It will be nice to see him. At the end of the game, we will share a glass of wine or beer or coke.&#8221;&#8220;I have to say thanks to him and to his staff so many times. I am in the Premier League because I learnt a lot with them.Sixth-placed United, who have not lost in the league since October, are on a four-game winning run, and while Karanka has set his sights on victory, he admits it will not be easy to outwit Mourinho.&#8220;I never go to a game aiming for a draw,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We will go to Old Trafford preparing and trying to win.&#8220;Sometimes I analyse them and I find similarities with us. But I have to do something different because he (Mourinho) knows me. I will try, but it&#8217;s difficult to surprise Jose.&#8221;-Reuters
