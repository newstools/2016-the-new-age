There was Christmas cheer for the Mdluli family who have just become proud homeowners thanks to the Gauteng provincial government.Thembelihle Mdluli, 23, from Lawley Ext 3, was thrust into the parenting of her four siblings, aged between five and 17, after her father died in 2009 and her mother last year. When both our parents died we never thought there was someone who would do this for us. Today we are saying goodbye to a shack and entering our new home that is fully furnished, she said.Meanwhile, 83-year-old Esther Matshepiso Khojane has become a homeowner after decades of deprivation. The octogenarian said she never dreamt she d actually own her own home. Living in a shack was hard, especially when it was raining. I am grateful to everyone who made my dream possible. I am now a homeowner, she said.Khojane and Mdluli were part of a group of the seven people in the community of Lawley identified by the Gauteng department of human settlement s programme to hand over houses as part of its 16 Days of Activism against abuse of women and children campaign.Other beneficiaries included the family of 11-year-old Joy Dikotla who is living with a disability plus a number of elderly people.The houses were built and fully furnished by Temi Construction and LTE Consulting.Keith Khoza, spokesperson for the provincial human settlements department, said it was painful to see the elderly spending the latter days of their lives in shacks, saying it was a sign that they had not attained true freedom.Khoza said living in a shack also had a negative impact on the education of a child as it was small and affected by adverse weather conditions. By building houses we are also building the character of a person and also confidence. For instance, the Mdluli children will be able to point to their home and also have a permanent address, he said.Freedom Hadebe of Temi Construction said when they arrived in the community to start building, as part of a government housing project, they saw a number of vulnerable families and decided to help them.He said the company was not only about building houses but also transforming the community they work in. We also have skills transfer in our sights so when we leave the community, members are skilled and are also able to say these are our houses and we built them, he said.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
