Senior citizens at Sonop Old Age Home near Brits received early Christmas cheers as they took delivery of groceries and cash.Acting social development MEC Fenny Gaolaolwe doled out the gifts amid applause and ululation of about 200 elderly people.Gaolaolwe said the elderly at the centre would no longer beg for money from visitors as they had been adequately catered for for the festive season. We are empowered by older persons norms and standards enshrined in the regulations, which outline that an amount deductible from social assistance grants must not exceed 90%, Gaolaolwe said. This means that the recipients of grants which include pensions qualify to receive 10% of their grants back to allow them to cater for their own needs, which are not provided for by the facility. The senior citizens broke into song and dance as they filled thw local community hall.Gaolaolwe said failure by care givers to take full advantage of available laws was a direct violation of elderly persons rights, as they turned into beggars, asking for small amounts of money from daily visitors.Gaolaolwe gave the elderly R300 in cash, towels, sweets and shared a Christmas cake with them.Since the beginning of the festive season, Gaolaolwe has held three functions to honour the elderly including the centenarians in Ratlou, Tswaing and Madibeng local municipalities.Gaolaolwe wished the seniors many more years coupled with good health.She said it was the responsibility of the department and the family members of elderly people to ensure that they aged gracefully.She said a tuck shop would be established at the premises to allow the elderly easy access to basic goods. From next year, we will make sure that we make arrangements with food outlets at the nearby mall to allow our oldies to have lunch there and also take them to the retail stores for shopping, she said.The elderly said the R300 and other goodies they received were the perfect Christmas present and they looked forward to improved living conditions at the centre.A beneficiary who did not want to be named said 10% of their social grants would go a long way in restoring their dignity. She said she would no longer beg for coins from visitors. If the MEC gives us R150 a month it will be a lot for us because we get everything here. We are thankful for the gifts received and want to thank the MEC and the government for making us happy, she said.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
