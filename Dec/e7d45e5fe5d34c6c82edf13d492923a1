Former Bloemfontein Celtic coach Tony de Nobrega will make his return to the dug-out when he leads Santos against Jomo Cosmos on Sunday after a year out of action.On Tuesday, De Nobrega was appointed as interim coach by the People s Team s following the sudden resignation of Zeca Marques on Monday.Things have not been going well for the NFD side since the beginning of the season and they are facing possible relegation if their fortunes don t change.Santos are second from the bottom of the second tier table with just 11 points from 14 matches.De Nobrega was last seen on the sidelines in October last year before parting ways with NFD outfit Vasco Da Gama, now known as Stellenbosch FC. It s exciting to be back. I have missed being out there giving instructions to players, De Nobrega said. I have spent the year doing a sports management course, I am a certified football scout now and I have been working as a scout and doing some TV commentary. The Sunday match will be the last this year and the coach is hoping to make a quick impact to help the beleaguered Santos to a victory. The team is in a bad situation so we need to hit the ground running. But I must say that they have not been performing badly, they were just unlucky, De Nobrega said. I m interested in the job, that s why I am here but I think the Sunday game will determine what will happen. SITHEMBISO DINDI
