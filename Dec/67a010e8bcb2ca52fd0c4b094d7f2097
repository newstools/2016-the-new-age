The city of Johannesburg is adopting a zero tolerance approach to criminals this festive season.Member of the mayoral committee for public safety Michael Sun made the warning at the launch of the Festive Road Safety campaign a joint operation between the Johannesburg metro police department (JMPD), emergency management services, disaster management and the South African Police Service (SAPS).Sun said criminals would have nowhere to hide during the festive season and motorists who failed to obey the rules of the road would also face the full might of the law.His warning came in the wake of the killing of two suspected robbers in three separate shoot-outs and a robbery attempt at four shopping centres in Gauteng at the weekend.A six-year-old boy is in a serious condition after he was hit by a stray bullet while sitting in a car at Lifestyle Centre in Centurion.Sun said the JMPD, assisted by the SAPS, would patrol streets and set up roadblocks. We want to make this festive season a safe and crime-free one, he said. We will not tolerate any criminal activity or the breaking of the rules of the road. Sun said the festive season was a period when normal business activity ended or was scaled down.He said this was also the period when many people took leave and travel to various places of entertainment, recreation and shopping centres. Unfortunately, the festive season also gives criminals the opportunity to target shoppers, businesses, homes and children. There is definitely a marked increase in criminal activity that requires police officers to be on high alert, with greater visibility on main roads, highways and exit routes. Sun also appealed to residents to use fireworks in a reasonable and considerate way. I have full confidence in the men and women of the JMPD and emergency services to carry out their work effectively and efficiently, he said. We also have the use of closed circuit TV to assist in the fight against crime, he said.NTOMBI NKOSI
