Back-to-back Premier League defeats by Liverpool and Arsenal in September forced Chelsea manager Antonio Conte to adopt the tactics that have sent his team on an 11-match winning run in the top flight.Chelsea beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Saturday to stretch their lead at the top of the table to seven points and equalled a club record for consecutive Premier League wins.Conte&#8217;s men were beaten 2-1 at home by Liverpool in September before losing 3-0 at Arsenal, and the manager said the defeats by title rivals had prompted him to change his formation and sparked his players into life.&#8220;Usually when I don&#8217;t win it&#8217;s very difficult to sleep, but now I&#8217;m sleeping the right (amount),&#8221; Conte told British media. &#8220;After 11 wins, we have a positive pressure that we want to continue.&#8220;I like to win, and to see my teams have two bad defeats &#8211; we deserved two bad defeats &#8212; I didn&#8217;t like this and I tried to find the right solution on the pitch, outside of the pitch.&#8220;We found the right solution with the players, to explain that we all deserve better than last season.&#8221;The Italian also said he was initially concerned about whether his players would be able to adapt to the new formation and if he was changing too much too soon.&#8220;In the history of Chelsea, this never happened, no? To change it totally, this situation, is not easy &#8212; you must go slowly, slowly, and to put the idea (across),&#8221; he added.&#8220;You always hope not to make great changes to the team. I have players that had only played with four (in defence).&#8221;The league leaders host Bournemouth on Dec. 26 and Stoke City on Dec. 31, before visiting Tottenham Hotspur on Jan. 4.-Reuters
