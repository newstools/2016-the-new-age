Provincial department of education has reiterated its call for 100% retrieval of textbooks before the closure of schools for the academic year.The aim of the campaign is to remind all pupils to return their textbooks for the benefit of future pupils and to ensure that the academic year starts on a high note without any hiccups.As the schools close tomorrow, the department said it was important that all books get back to the libraries so that pupils and teachers can hit the ground running by having all their material.Spokesperson for the department Geoffrey van der Merwe said the department was appealing to pupils, parents, guardians and the community at large to help them in getting all the textbooks before the end of the 2016 academic year.Van der Merwe also called on all Grade 12 pupils to drop off their textbooks of the subjects they have completed writing. Education is a societal matter and this campaign is aimed at all residents as well as those in and out of school. We want to ensure that all books are returned to the schools, he said.Meanwhile, the department applauded pupils and teachers who worked hard during the examination period to ensure that the process ran smoothly without any leakage of papers.Spokesperson Geoffrey van der Merwe said all 136 examination centres administered the exams well while adding that marking of the papers began last week Friday and is expected to be completed next week on Thursday. We have employed 895 markers after a thorough selection process to ensure that quality marking of answer scripts will take place, he said.MEC Martha Bartlett said they had done enough to improve the 69% pass rate. This year we are confident that we have done all that needs to be done to ensure that we improve our pupils future towards a better life. Our main plan was aimed at improving our pupils performance at all levels, with the emphasis on Grade 12, Bartlett said.TIISETSO MANOKO
