Defeated Gambian President Yahya Jammeh insisted Wednesday he would not leave office at the end of his mandate in January until a court rules on his challenge to the outcome of this month&#8217;s election.Jammeh, who has been in power in the west African country for 22 years, has rejected the victory of opposition candidate Adama Barrow in the December 1 vote.&#8220;Unless the court decides the case, there will be no inauguration (of Barrow) on the 19 January,&#8221; said Jammeh, who had initially conceded defeat but then lodged a complaint with the Supreme Court to overturn the result.&#8220;What we are asking for is not for the IEC (Independent Election Commission) to declare me the winner, I cannot do that,&#8221; he said in a lengthy television address.&#8220;Justice must be done and the only way justice can be done is to reorganise the election so that every Gambian votes. That&#8217;s the only way we can resolve the matter peacefully and fairly.&#8221;He also took aim at the regional ECOWAS bloc which has called on Jammeh to accept the results, saying: &#8220;My rights cannot be violated and intimidated to a point where I succumb to blackmail.&#8221;&nbsp;-AFP
