Most Asian markets struggled Tuesday with traders spooked by geopolitical concerns following deadly attacks in Europe but Tokyo&#8217;s Nikkei returned to winning ways, reversing an earlier sell-off as the yen rebounded.The euro retreated against the dollar after at least 12 people were killed and dozens injured late Monday when a lorry was driven into a packed Berlin Christmas market in what police said was &#8220;a probable terrorist attack&#8221;.That came after an off-duty policeman shot dead Russia&#8217;s ambassador to Turkey in Ankara, prompting a vow from President Vladimir Putin to step up the fight against &#8220;terrorism&#8221;. Also Monday, three people were hurt in a gun attack on a mosque in Zurich. The incidents led to a promise by US President-elect Donald Trump to wipe &#8220;terrorists&#8221; off the face of the Earth.&#8220;There are some investors who might see something like the assassination in Turkey and the potential terror attack in Berlin as opportunities to lock in profits with a couple of weeks left in the year,&#8221; Philip Orlando, chief equities strategist at Federated Investors, in New York, told Bloomberg News.Monday&#8217;s events come as geopolitical tension was ratcheted up after China last week seized an unmanned US sea survey probe from international waters in the South China Sea.That sparked a rebuke from Trump, raising fears about future US ties with China, with the tycoon already hitting out at Beijing in recent weeks over several issues from Taiwan to trade.Dollar back up Hong Kong was 0.6 percent lower in the afternoon while Shanghai ended down 0.5 percent, with mainland Chinese investors fret over a weakening yuan and rising bond yields that are making borrowing more costly.Manila shed 1.6 percent, Jakarta fell 0.3 percent and Kuala Lumpur lost 0.2 percent while Bangkok and Mumbai were also well down.However, Tokyo ended 0.5 percent higher after the Bank of Japan held fire on its stimulus but gave an upbeat view of the world&#8217;s number-three economy as exports pick up on the back of a weaker yen. The Nikkei fell slightly Monday for the first time after a nine-day rally. Sydney added 0.5 percent and Seoul gained 0.2 percent while Taipei and Wellington were flat.The yen has fallen more than 17 percent against the greenback since Trump&#8217;s shock US presidential election win in November fanned speculation that his plans for big government spending and tax cuts will force the Federal Reserve to hike borrowing costs. In forex trade Tuesday the yen gave up initial gains falling back towards 118 to the dollar.The greenback continues to push higher after the Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate hike last week and indication that it will lift them another three times next year.The euro bought $1.0380, struggling to get out of a downward spiral that could see it hit parity with the greenback for the first time since late 2002.-AFP
