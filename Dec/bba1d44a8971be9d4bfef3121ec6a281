Google-owned video sharing platform YouTube was quick to adopt full HD and even UHD 4K for clips hosted on its site but now it&#8217;s offering the highest possible resolution for live creations, too.Adding full 4K support for live streams is a huge leap and for the moment at least puts YouTube well ahead of Facebook, Twitter and Twitch as the platform for broadcasting content on the fly or livestreaming events.And to prove that the system really is up and working, the first live streamed 4K show will be coming on December 1 and it&#8217;s rather fitting that it happens to be Game Awards.The current trend for livestreaming was born out of gamers broadcasting their gameplay prowess or playing games and taking on challenges together.-Relaxnews
