Iran&#8217;s President Hassan Rouhani and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin welcomed the &#8220;Syrian army&#8217;s victory against the terrorists in Aleppo&#8221; during a late-night phone call, Iranian media reported on Sunday.&#8220;The Syrian army&#8217;s victory sends a message that the terrorists cannot achieve their objectives. We must stop terrorists using the ceasefire to rebuild their forces and create new bases in other regions of Syria,&#8221; Rouhani said following the call on Saturday night, according to a statement published by state media.Putin also welcomed the defeat of rebel forces in Syria&#8217;s second city and said cooperation between Tehran and Moscow &#8220;will continue&#8221;.They said peace talks would take place in Kazakhstan, without providing further details.Iran and Russia have been the key backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and label all rebel forces in the country as &#8220;terrorists&#8221;.&#8220;The result of this cooperation is a major victory in the fight against international terrorism,&#8221; added Putin.Syrian troops this week retook control of eastern Aleppo, which has been held by disparate rebel groups since mid-2012, after a devastating month-long offensive that has caused tens of thousands of refugees to flee their homes.Russia&#8217;s entry into the conflict in September 2015 &#8212; primarily through air strikes &#8212; helped turn the tide for Assad, while Iran has provided military advisors and frontline &#8220;volunteer&#8221; fighters.-AFP
