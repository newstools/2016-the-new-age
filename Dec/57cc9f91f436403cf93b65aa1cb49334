The LG ProBeam will be marketed as a compact consumer projector with professional performance when it goes on sale after its global debut at CES 2017 this January.Though LG has built a solid reputation for the quality of its high-end LED projectors, this new device is the first that it has built specifically for use in and around the average home.It tips the scales at just 2kg, so it&#8217;s lighter than most notebook computers, and, thanks to Bluetooth and Miracast support, should be simple to pair with audio and visual sources &#8212; i.e., a set of wireless speakers and the video content from a smartphone or tablet.What&#8217;s more, it runs on the company&#8217;s webOS Smart TV platform so it can also tap into a host of video-streaming apps as well as simply syncing with other LG products.&#8220;LG is confident its expertise in the home entertainment sector will make its first compact laser projector a hit with consumers,&#8221; said Tim Alessi, head of product marketing at LG Electronics USA. &#8220;LG is proud to continue pioneering the home cinema experience in dynamic new ways.&#8221;Rated at 2000 lumens, the ProBeam will be the lightest full HD laser projector of its kind available when it goes on sale. And that brightness rating means that a crisp widescreen image should be possible even in rooms where blocking out light isn&#8217;t possible.As such it will be potentially ideal for those consumers that like a proper movie night but don&#8217;t have the wall space for a proper cinema display-size TV set.However, as adoption rates for 4K UHD televisions are picking up &#8212; 2017 is widely considered the year that sales really take off &#8212; consumers could think twice about a projector, no matter how well designed and compact, that didn&#8217;t support the new image standard.According to NPD Group, the majority of Americans now know what ultra-high definition TV is (traditionally the metric used to identify the tipping point into the mainstream of an emerging technology), while 33% of consumers are now interested in having a 4K set of their own at home.And with prices for televisions with four times HD resolution now widely available for $500 and less at big box retailers, the ProBeam, for which LG has not yet revealed the price, could struggle to get noticed.-Relaxnews
