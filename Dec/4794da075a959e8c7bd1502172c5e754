The ANC in the province has commended the cooperative governance, human settlement and traditional affairs MEC, Alvin Botes, for his efforts to root out corruption in local government.ANC provincial secretary Zamani Saul said the party made a commitment in its manifesto during local government elections in August to intensify the fight against fraud and corruption.The ANC was responding to the action taken by Botes in the !Kheis local municipality where senior officials have been suspended for allegations of corruption and wasting taxpayers money. Saul said the implementation of recommendations emanating from forensic investigations conducted in municipalities indicated the ANC-led government was serious about the fight against fraud and corruption in the province. The ANC therefore applauds the good work done by Botes in ensuring that corrupt municipal officials are liable for the losses incurred by the municipality as a result of their corrupt actions, Saul said.Recently, Botes said his department would be calling in members of the Hawks, the legislature, the national council of provinces and the ministers of finance and Coghsta to discuss irregular and unauthorised expenditure at !Kheis municipality.He said the municipal manager, Teresa Scheepers, signed an agreement with Nashua without following supply chain management processes for a contract which costs R19 000 a month and an overall value of R7m after more than five years. Council delegated the powers and functions to the municipal manger, owever, he delegated the financial functions to the chief financial officer without concurrence of council, Botes said.TNA REPORTER|provinces@thenewage.co.za
