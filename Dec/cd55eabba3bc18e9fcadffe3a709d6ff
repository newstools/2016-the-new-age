ANC Youth League (ANCYL) president Collen Maine says the ANC s problem is not President Jacob Zuma, as critics have suggested, but the infiltration of its national executive committee (NEC) by capitalists.Speaking at the economic transformation lecture hosted by the ANCYL in KwaZulu-Natal in Durban yesterday, Maine said some NEC members were hell-bent on protecting capitalists at the expense of the organisation and the country.The lecture was attended by the ANC s top brass led by President Zuma. There are people in the leadership of the ANC who are reporting elsewhere, they are handled by capitalists and the challenge is to cleanse the ANC, he said.Maine said he was not going to name and shame because the media was covering the lecture but said the ANC needed to rid itself of the people who were no longer loyal to the organisation and its values. We ve got protectors of capitalists. In the ANC there are people who became too comfortable after 1994 because they are now driving expensive German cars, they have forgotten what the organisation stands for and the work that still needs to be done for South Africans to attain true economic freedom, he said.He said if the ANC failed to address the issues of the economy in the country, where black people had no access to the country s wealth including land and minerals, it might not be in power in 10 years time because voters would get frustrated and take their votes elsewhere.ANCYL KZN chairperson Thami Ngubane called on the government to implement policies that protected local industries from cheap imports.NOKUTHULA NTULInokuthulan@thenewage.co.za
