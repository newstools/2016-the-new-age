Bidvest Wits were held to a 1-1 draw by Maritzburg United in an Absa Premiership clash at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Tuesday night.The draw sees Wits move a level on points with in form Cape Town City on 25 points.The Cape Town based outfit will be in action against struggling Free State Stars at the Goble Park Stadium on Wednesday. Wits are topping the league log with 25 points from 13 games and have a game in hand.However coach Gavin Hunt said having a game in hand does not mean you will win the game. Game in hand means nothing. The last five games we have really been not getting the results, said Hunt.The Clever Boys started off the league campaign on a perfect start and Hunt will be wanting his side to continue with this fine form. As the January transfer window draws near, Hunt will want to bolster his squad to make sure he continues to fight for the league in the second round. We have to get few players. We have to get James Keene to make a huge difference in the front. Phakamani is also coming back.&#8220;One or two players should come in once the opportunity arises . Certainly we need one or two players in other areas, concluded Hunt.-Ntsako Mashaba
