Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf on Thursday inaugurated the first turbine of a hydro plant totally destroyed during the nation&#8217;s civil war.&#8220;Thank all of you for being a part of this historic day; the day when big lights in a small way replaced small lights of yesterday,&#8221; Sirleaf said during a ceremony at the Mount Coffee hydro plant.The plant, constructed in 1967, served the Liberian capital Monrovia and other areas until it was destroyed in 1990.Since the end of the country&#8217;s devastating 14-year civil war in 2003, electricity supply has been the economy&#8217;s biggest challenge, with homes, businesses, hospitals and schools all operating with generators.The hydro plant &#8212; which is expected to provide 22 megawatts of electricty now and 88 megawatts after completion &#8212; is comprised of ten turbines, only one of which has yet been made functional.&nbsp;-AFP
