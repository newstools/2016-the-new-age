Sales of new cars dipped by double digits this year compared with that of last year. The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) said that conditions in the new vehicle market have remained extremely difficult characterised by double digit declines in all segments.MD for Nissan Africa, Mike Whitfield said lower new-car sales were expected. We knew that 2016 would follow the downward trend of 2015 and braced for the inevitable. Wary consumers have put the brakes on spending especially on big ticket outlays as slow economic growth continues to bite, he said. It s a combination of the rand weakness, high interest rates, petrol price hikes and rising inflation. October data show that sales slumped 10% compared to the same month last year, dropping from 54 239 to 48 745 units.However, Whitfield said despite a double-digit decline, the industry has to keep going . Dealers are in the firing line of changing consumer buying patterns. They face a lot of pressure to come up with innovative ways to keep footfall on showroom floors not only to satisfy their bosses but to ensure the viability of their businesses. Naamsa said that domestically, the short to medium term outlook remained extremely challenging.Double digit new vehicle price inflation, pressure on household disposable incomes, low levels of business confidence and relatively high interest rates continue to impact negatively on new vehicle sales. Whitfield said while the local market is in the doldrums, exports to sub-Saharan African markets have outperformed increasing almost 11%, from 27 719 units to 30718 units, year on year in October. This is despite lower growth prospects in many sub-Saharan Africa markets.Although we are a long way off from reversing this trend, he said, passenger cars and light commercial vehicle exports into Africa are still buoyant.-Thelma Ngoma|thelman@thenewage.co.za
