Two elite Iraqi units linked up in Mosul on Saturday and will form a joint front to advance westward against the Islamic State group, officers said.The Rapid Response Division reached the northern edge of Al-Intisar neighbourhood, while the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) advanced to the southern side of the adjoining Al-Quds area.The two neighbourhoods are located on the eastern side of Mosul, where security forces have retaken multiple areas from IS, but the city&#8217;s west is still completely in jihadist hands.&#8220;God willing, Al-Intisar neighbourhood is completely liberated,&#8221; Brigadier General Mahdi Abbas Abdullah, the commander of the Rapid Response Division&#8217;s 2nd Brigade, told AFP.&#8220;We will become one front&#8221; and will advance &#8220;towards the river,&#8221; he said, referring to the Tigris, which divides Mosul in two.Lieutenant Colonel Athir al-Basri of Rapid Response also confirmed its forces and those from CTS had reached the same main street that divides Al-Intisar and Al-Quds.Iraqi forces launched the massive operation to retake Mosul on October 17, eventually pushing into the city from the east.On Wednesday, Iraqi forces announced the &#8220;second phase&#8221; of the battle for the eastern side of the city, marking the start of a new round of intensive fighting after progress had previously slowed to a crawl.Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had pledged Mosul would be retaken by year&#8217;s end.Earlier in the week, Abadi said the country would need three months to eliminate IS &#8212; still an ambitious timeline given that it would mean retaking Mosul, clearing the jihadists out of western territory they hold, and eliminating sleeper cells in government-controlled areas.-AFP
