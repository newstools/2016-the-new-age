A firearm disguised as a pretty-in-pink Hello Kitty toy and a dead seahorse floating in a bottle of brandy are among some of the items that air travelers tried to get past the TSA in 2016.As the 2016 travel year comes to a close, the US Transportation Security Administration released their list of the Top 10 Most Unusual Checkpoint Finds over the last 12 months.Perhaps not surprisingly, a scan of the list reveals that security officers at the world&#8217;s busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, are perhaps also the busiest when it comes to spotting unusual carry-on items.Three of the top 10 items were found at the Atlanta hub, including the chart-topping find: a ghoulishly realistic decayed corpse that turned out to be a movie prop.Here are the TSA&#8217;s top 10 most unusual finds of 2016:10.
