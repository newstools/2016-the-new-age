One of the main components of the sevens game is a strong bench that can enter the fray and quickly change the course of a match. This is the reason why Blitzbokke super sub Ruhan Nel does not have a problem with starting matches off the bench for Neil Powell s side. The 25 year old, who also features in the 15-man game for the Griquas as a centre or fullback, managed to get his name on the score sheet against Uganda in Dubai.With a big performance expected when the Blitzbokke take on Russia, the US and Australia in Cape Town from Saturday, Nel has challenged the South African bench to be focused and ready for action when required. We had a very strong bench that fought hard and made our jobs easier. The guys stuck to the systems. In tournaments like these, it is always a 12 man contribution. The starting seven always go there to make a solid foundation for the reserves to come on and finish the game, Nel said. I want to start matches, but I know I have an important role to play. There is always so much to play for even if it is two minutes. It is a game of seconds and a game of opportunities. Opportunities do not come as often as you would like but you must always be ready. You must make positive tackles and positive moves in those seconds. The Blitzbokke head into the Cape Town leg of the World Rugby Sevens Series as defending champions having won the cup last year. They are also high in confidence, having won the Dubai leg. That result sees Powell s side top the table with 22 points, while defending world champions Fiji are second with 19 points.
