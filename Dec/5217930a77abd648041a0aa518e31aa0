It s effectively the best functioning and most successful IDZ in the country and also has world class management and corporate governance, Lionel October, director-general of the Department of Trade and Industry said at the weekend.The DG s visit to the CDC follows from the DTI s engagement with the EC government on the special economic zone (SEZ) programme.

We remain forever indebted to the DTI for its continued support and guidance throughout the years, Silinga said.Silinga said the CDC has seen great success this year managing to maintain its trajectory as the preferred foreign direct investment (FDI) destination of choice by consistently ensuring that projects brought about in the IDZ translate to tangible jobs and skills development.According to CDC, the 2015-16 highlights include the signing of 17 new investors with an accumulated value of R26.99bn.However, over the past five years, the CDC signed a total of 61 new investors with a combined investment value of R35.8bn. 701316TNA REPORTER
