City went into this game chasing the title after a three-month unbeaten run. With Frank Swift in goal, their superiority in this game was &#8220;overwhelming enough to nullify analysis&#8221;, according to a newspaper report. Eric Brook scored a hat-trick while Liverpool&#8217;s Matt Busby, the former City favourite who went on to become Manchester United manager, gave &#8220;a disheartened display (that) was a tragedy for Liverpool.&#8221; City did not look back, going on to win the league after scoring 49 goals more than second-placed Charlton Athletic.Liverpool 1 Manchester City 3 (Dec 1981)This game was significant not so much for City&#8217;s victory, courtesy of the sort of Bruce Grobbelaar goalkeeping blunders that would shame even Loris Karius or Simon Mignolet, but the fact that it represented a rare low point in Liverpool&#8217;s progress to the title under Bob Paisley. Floundering in 12th place, they went on to steamroller the division to pip Ipswich Town while City, who were second after their first Anfield win for 28 years, dropped to 10th.Liverpool 1 Manchester City 2 (May 2003)Manchester City&#8217;s only Premier League win at Anfield came in 2003, and they left it until the third minute of injury time to score the winner. Former Liverpool striker Nicolas Anelka completed City&#8217;s comeback with his second goal after Milan Baros had volleyed the Reds ahead. Ex-Red Robbie Fowler was also in the City side, who were managed by another Anfield favourite, Kevin Keegan.Manchester City 2 Liverpool 3 (Oct 2008)This performance showed why Rafa Benitez&#8217;s side pushed Manchester United close for the title in 2008-9. Trailing to strikes from Stephen Ireland and Javier Garrido at the break, Liverpool never lost their self-belief and after a Fernando Torres double and Pablo Zabaleta&#8217;s dismissal had turned the tide, Dirk Kuyt once again proving himself the striker for the big occasion with a close-range winner late on.Manchester City 1 Liverpool 4 (Nov 2015)This was a contender for Liverpool&#8217;s best performance under Juergen Klopp. City were torn apart in the first half by a dazzling performance at the Etihad that saw the visitors go three up through a Mangala own goal and strikes from Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino. Sergio Aguero rallied City before the break but Martin Skrtel restored the winning margin with a thunderous fourth late on.
