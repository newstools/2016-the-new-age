Saudi Arabia&#8217;s King Salman arrived in Qatar on Monday as part of a rare regional tour ahead of the annual summit of Arab leaders of the oil-rich Gulf states.The trip comes at the time of a political transition in the United States and as deadly conflicts rage in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.Salman began his tour in the United Arab Emirates, a key pillar of a Saudi-led Arab coalition that has been battling Iran-backed Shiite Huthi rebels in Yemen since March 2015.After Qatar, he will travel on to Kuwait and Bahrain, which is to host this year&#8217;s Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit.His trip excludes Oman, known for its warm ties with the kingdom&#8217;s regional arch-foe Iran and the only GCC member which is not taking part in the Saudi-led coalition.British Prime Minister Theresa May, visiting the Gulf for the first time since she came to office in July, will attend the two-day GCC summit which begins December 6.&nbsp;-AFP
