Malaysia confirmed an eighth Zika virus case on Sunday, involving a 67-year-old man who first showed symptoms in late November.An online statement from the Health Ministry&#8217;s director general, Noor Hisham Abdullah, did not specify if the man from the state of Selangor contracted the case locally or overseas.The statement said that during Nov. 14-28, the man was in Kuala Lumpur, in the Selangor city of Shah Alam and in Perak state, north of Selangor.&#8220;His family members were questioned and their blood and urine samples were taken as soon as he (the patient) tested positive for Zika,&#8221; said Noor Hisham.&#8220;Active case detection is being conducted in the patient&#8217;s residential area to detect if neighbouring residents have symptoms of Zika.&#8221;Malaysia confirmed its first Zika case in September, after a woman tested positive for the virus following a three-day visit to neighbouring Singapore.U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.-Reuters
