&nbsp;In spite of meager sales figures, BlackBerry could soon release a new smartphone, once again running Google&#8217;s Android OS and with a physical keyboard.The firm has also developed an innovative Internet of Things security solution for business.Pictures of what could be a BlackBerry DTEK 70, due for release in 2017, have leaked on social media. However, since BlackBerry recently announced plans to pull out of smartphone manufacturing, it&#8217;s not clear who exactly will be building the phone.The BlackBerry DTEK50, which launched this summer, for example, was, in fact, an Alcatel Idol 4 with a software overlay and a series of in-house encryption and security solutions.The DTEK 70, codenamed &#8220;Mercury,&#8221; could see the return of a classic keyboard to BlackBerry, underneath a 4.5-inch screen (1080p).The handset is thought to be equipped with 18Mpx and 8Mpx cameras, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of memory and the Android OS.Rumors also point to the presence of a fingerprint sensor and a data encryption system, as seen in all of the manufacturer&#8217;s smartphones.Reality is harsh for BlackBerry, which only maintains a tiny market share in global smartphone sales (approximately 0.1% according to Gartner).To address the situation, the firm is refocusing its core business strategy on services, notably for businesses, the brand&#8217;s historic clients.Having lost the battle on the hardware front, BlackBerry&#8217;s turnaround is increasingly reliant on software.On that front, the firm recently presented BlackBerry Secure, a new security management platform covering all of a company&#8217;s connected devices (computers, smartphones, tablets, etc.).-Relaxnews
