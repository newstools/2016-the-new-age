Parliament has rejected as sensational and misleading a weekend newspaper report about the institution s secretary, Gengezi Mgidlana.Parliament said it noted with great concern a sensational article published by the Sunday newspaper, City Press. The front-page article, Parliament said, was essentially a rehash of a series of old articles to which this institution has replied comprehensively .The situation was compounded by the apparent personal targeting of Mgidlana through baseless insinuations of wrongdoing or breaking the law. Parliament sees the series of articles aimed at denigrating the standing of the secretary to Parliament, hoping to derail the programme of remodelling and repositioning this institution to be able to lead good governance from the front, as it has begun turning the corner with a clean audit finding by the auditor-general, Parliament said.Of the allegations, Parliament said the report ignored facts such as the exchange rate and also selectively portrayed costs of official trips to international partners as very high. For example, a basic hotel accommodation service, which costs R1 300 for bed and breakfast for every civil servant in South Africa, could cost about R23000 per day in London. The policies are clear with regard to transport and accommodation services the secretary, as the accounting officer of Parliament, is entitled to nationally and internationally, Parliament said.On allegations of Mgidlana having used chauffeur services, Parliament said this was done in line with the applicable policies and regulations .On labour matters, Parliament said it was determined to sustain its constructive and principled approach as it strongly believed attempts to derail its efforts to improve the performance outputs and outcomes were bound to fail. A culture of entitlement to bonuses that had permeated every unit of the institution over many years, had to be confronted and corrected through decisive leadership and management, Parliament said.DENNIS CRUYWAGEN news@thenewage.co.za
