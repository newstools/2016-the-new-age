The lack of financial backing from the government, though disheartening, will not deter Liyanda Hlongwane from making a difference in the lives of young girls across the country.The 26-year-old founder of the Assaggi Girls Foundation, which supports underprivileged girls by providing sanitary pads, said she wished she enjoyed more support from the government to help as many girls as possible.Hlongwane has commissioned a tissue-making plant in Silverton, Pretoria and is at an advanced stage of venturing into sanitary towel manufacturing at her R2m factory.She hopes to get into an arrangement with the government, where she can manufacture quality sanitary towels at a cheaper price so they can be distributed freely to schools everywhere in the country, especially the rural areas. I am hoping that I reach out to government and it reaches back to us to say: We hear the vision, we hear the goal, we hear the mission and we are willing to support you. Open the doors that need to be opened, she said.She said government support would make it easier to reach even the remotest areas in the country.Hlongwane started a sanitary distribution campaign, which took flight on social media.She has been able to get people to donate sanitary pads and have them donated to various schools across the provinces. But I thought to myself, how long am I going to beg for donations, why not introduce a new product in the market? Why not manufacture pads, because at the end of the day I need money to fuel and run my campaign. People can only do so much, she said.Hlongwane said she planned to manufacture the pads at the same plant where she produces her tissue, making it easier for the government to fund the project as the structure is already there. I sit down and try to figure out why the government has not done anything about it because this is one thing we need. Just as we get RDP houses, we need RDP pads, she quipped.Hlongwane said she wanted her project to grow beyond the borders of South Africa to other African countries as the problem was widespread across the continent.While reports say that about 7 million girls miss about 60 days of school every year because of their periods, Africa Check has said there was no substantive evidence to back the figure up.A report on the figure said though girls may suffer the indignity of being forced to use alternatives during their period, there was no data showing that they stayed at home in numbers.snn4@thenewage.co.za
