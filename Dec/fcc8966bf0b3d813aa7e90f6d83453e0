The Department of Correctional Services could be forced to find alternative housing for more than 2000 excess prisoners who are awaiting trial at Pollsmoor Prison.This comes after the Western Cape High Court gave the department two weeks to return to court and convince the judge why it shouldn t order the prison s population to be halved.The case was brought to court by NGOs Sonke Gender Justice and Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR) to compel the government to address the issue of overcrowding in the facility.According to the application, the facility was operating at around 249% capacity, accommodating 4032 detainees.Constitutional Court judge Edwin Cameron found that the overcrowding led to a lack of resources like healthcare, beds or working toilets.This week, the court ordered the department to devise a comprehensive plan setting out how it has tried to deal with the situation. LHR has welcomed the court order. LHR, along with the applicant, Sonke Gender Justice, is extremely pleased with the order received by the Cape High Court today. The cCourt has made it clear that conditions of detention falling short of constitutional and statutory standards require the government s immediate attention and resources, the organisation said in a statement. In his report released last year, Cameron recommended that additional cells must be constructed either by transforming existing infrastructure or by building additional cells to address overcrowding. Not only were the cells desperately overcrowded, but it was apparent that there are serious staff shortages. Hence correctional staff feel vulnerable. This means more risk of harm to them and more risk of harm to inmates. Several staff members reported that gangs are a problem, not only at Pollsmoor but in other Western Cape prisons, Cameron said.Dudu Dubedudud@thenewage.co.za
