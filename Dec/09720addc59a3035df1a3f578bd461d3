Award-winning songstress Zahara, real name Bulelwa Mkutukana, has threatened to take legal action against True Love magazine for what she s labelled a misleading headline.Taking to social media to express her disappointment with the way she was portrayed, she threatened to sue the publication if it don t retract its recently released January cover, captioned: Zahara: marriage, drugs and selling records. I hope this is a sick joke from True Love magazine, how dare they put this type of headline on their cover. Why associate me with drugs? This is an utterly tasteless and misleading coverline, the singer said on her social media page on Tuesday. If they don t recall this cover today I will be left with no choice but to take legal action against them. She said the headline gives the wrong impression that she s done drugs, which is not a true reflection of the story. I ll never lie and say I don t drink, I do. I m of age and I m allowed to. I ve never been on drugs. I m clean as a whistle, she was quoted as saying in the magazine. Speaking to The New Age yesterday the Loliwe hit maker said the publication had been ignoring her calls. I am going ahead with legal action against True Love, I am actually meeting with my lawyers tomorrow to discuss a way forward, the singer said.A number of celebrities such as Lerato Kganyago, Bonang Matheba and rapper AKA have slammed the headline, with Matheba referring to the magazine as trash . True Love doesn t give a s*** about women or their stories, they just want to sell magazines. Whether they humiliate them or not, AKA tweeted.Among other Tweeter users expressing their outrage was @ginzimas, who said: When has Zahara ever admitted to using drugs. You guys are misleading. -NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
