 Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi on Wednesday said 82 279 learners have still not been placed at schools for 2017 academic year.Lesufi was briefing media on the state of readiness for the 2017 academic year.&#8220;To date, there are 2, 368, 264 learners enrolled in Gauteng schools. An increase of 105 945 learners were recorded between 2015 and 2016 total enrolments,&#8221; said Lesufi.&#8220;This represents an increase of 4.47%. Rapid in-migration remains a contributing factor to the growth in learner numbers. The highest numbers of learners come from Limpopo followed by Eastern Cape,&#8221; he continued.This came after a lot of parents were frustrated over the online registration system, some of them saying the online registration system violates the rights of people who don&#8217;t have access to technology and pleading with the MEC to cancel it.&#8220;The Department is grateful for the cooperation it has received from parents that heeded the call to use the online system. It goes without saying that some parents faced frustration during the application and placement period,&#8221; said Lesufi.&#8220;For example, many parents complained that they did not receive updates on the state of application. For this, we apologise unconditionally to those parents,&#8221; said the MEC.A concerned parent, Bulelwa Kondile, who applied and followed the procedures, said she is concerned that all the nearest schools are full and she is still waiting for a reply.The MEC promised to attend to the grievances saying &#8220;I take these matters seriously and i promise to attend to them.&#8221;The education department has appealed to parents whose children have not yet been placed to come forward.TNA Reporter
