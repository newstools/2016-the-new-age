Despite concerted efforts made through various interventions to curb air pollution in Africa, the problem of air pollution still haunts the continent.With Nigeria topping the continent as the most polluted country, South Africa comes sixth on the list. A study released by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently shows that premature deaths from air pollution per country in Africa remains high.The study also revealed that the extent to which air pollution in Africa has been increasing and is causing more premature deaths than unsafe water or childhood malnutrition, and could develop into a health and climate crisis reminiscent of those seen in China and India .Outdoor air, also known as ambient particulate , has been increasing rapidly in fastdeveloping countries such as Egypt, South Africa, Ethiopia and Nigeria. In the period of 1990 to 2013, outdoor air has caused an annual death rate of 712 000 across the continent.In South Africa, outdoor air has been a major concern, resulting in the South African Weather Service (SAWS) and South African Air Quality Information System (SAAQIS) hosting an information session at the most polluted region in the country, Hartbeespoort.The information session was attended by pupils from schools in the area and interested community members.Surprisingly, in 2013 Hartbeespoort was not in the top spot but when the World Health Organisation (WHO) released its 2016 global urban ambient air pollution database it saw the region leapfrog Johannesburg to the top spot in South Africa.Emission sources that impact Hartbeespoort s air, which have been identified at the station, include residential pollution (20km to the south), city centre (25km to the east), industrial pollution (20km northeast), residential pollution (10km southeast), 30km northwest and industrial and residential pollution 18km north-northwest.It is also been found that the biggest contributor to this region is not only the mines in the area but also the cities of Tshwane and Johannesburg which lies second and third on the list respectively. In the world rating the region is ranked as the 162nd most air-polluted area.According to World Bank research findings, air pollution in South Africa kills 20000 people annually while it is responsible for 5.5 million deaths worldwide. This, according to the World Bank, makes air pollution the fourth leading causes of premature death in the world. The lead author of the bank research.Urvashi Narain, warned that the scale of the problem is truly daunting . In terms of cost, the bank found premature death cost South Africa nearly R300m each year. Indeed, the cost of air pollution becomes the burden of the state when people start missing work and spending money on medicine for asthma, thereby shackling development in the country.During the World Environmental Health Conference in Mpumalanga last month, deputy director of national environmental health, Belinda Makhafola, said: The implementation of policies that would address the problem of water and air pollution needs to be done now. Also, the World Environmental Health has vowed to take a leading role in monitoring environmental health policies in South Africa to curb the problem.S busiso Mtungwa is a writer and cmmentator
