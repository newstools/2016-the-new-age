George Horne is one of the 70 beneficiaries of the Read Well Glasses campaign that was organised by Clicks in partnership with the Sol Plaatje municipality recently.Together with other elderly people staying at the Sechwareng Old Age Home in Galeshewe, Horne was a recipient of free reading glasses, as most of them have cataract blindness and need to have operations.The 74-year-old Horne has been experiencing eyesight problems for a long time without treatment or approaching any optometrist to test them.Pharmacist assistant at Clicks Gregory Wagter, said while they didn t do operations, they could provide an alternative option to those who had eyesight problems. We have a campaign where we give reading glasses for free to elderly people, Wagter said. We urge municipalities to assist us as they work directly with communities to identify old people who need help so that we can assist them. Wagter said they issued a size three glasses package which was the strongest set of lenses that they offered to people who were in desperate need. For every pair of glasses that people buy, we design one pack for old people, he said.Ward 4 councillor Thokozile Mpanza said many of the elderly people living there were in need of cataract operations while others just needed glasses.Mpanza said the municipality identified the old age home after the elderly complained that they were experiencing persistent eyesight problems. There are about 70 people living at the home but as you can see, there is only a handful here today because some have already gone home for the holidays, Mpanza said. We will give to the rest of them at a later stage when they come back from the holidays. Mpanza further said she was concerned about the general well-being of old people living within her ward who needed different types of medical attention. Some come to me for a number of issues but we wanted to make sure that they were well looked after, she said.NOMUSA MVUBU
