The dollar retreated against most major peers in Asian trade on Monday as investors cashed in after a Federal Reserve-fuelled surge last week, while equities were also lower on concerns about China-US tensions.The losses tracked a decline on Wall Street after it emerged China had seized an unmanned US sea survey probe from international waters in the South China Sea. Thursday&#8217;s move raised geopolitical concerns as Donald Trump prepares to enter the White House, having hit out at Beijing in recent weeks over several issues from Taiwan to trade.Last week the dollar soared after the Fed raised borrowing costs and hinted at three more increases next year &#8212; surprising many who had priced in two &#8212; as it prepares for steeper price rises if Trump makes good on promises of tax cuts and big infrastructure spending.But in afternoon trading Monday the greenback was down against the yen, euro and pound, while some emerging market currencies &#8212; which were hammered by a flight of cash to the dollar &#8212; were also up.However, the Malaysian ringgit touched lows not seen since the 1998 Asian financial crisis. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see the dollar index in a sustained rally &#8212; two rate hikes are priced into fed funds futures, and a lot of expectation is built into Trump&#8217;s policies,&#8221; Janu Chan, a senior economist at St. George Bank in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.&#8220;On the other side of the equation, the (European Central Bank) and (Bank of Japan) are not likely to ramp up monetary stimulus any more.

Perhaps expectations were too high.&#8221;Hong Kong slipped 0.7 percent in the afternoon, Shanghai ended down 0.2 percent and Singapore lost 0.8 percent. There were also sharp losses in Taipei and Manila while Seoul was flat.However, Sydney added 0.5 percent as the government stuck to its plan to return the budget to surplus by 2021 and despite downgrading forecasts for economic growth, with fears growing it could lose its AAA credit rating.-AFP
