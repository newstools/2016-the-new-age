THE Cape Town Minstrel Carnival Association (CTMCA) is threatening legal action against the city of Cape Town after it was denied a permit for the Voorsmakie event.The event is scheduled to take place tomorrow and is a teaser for the Tweede Nuwe Jaar celebrations.The city s mayoral committee member for tourism, events and economic development, Eddie Andrews, said the city turned down the application due to non-compliance by the event organiser and failure to produce the required plans for safety, traffic management, road closures, fencing and toilets.He said payment was still outstanding for services rendered during last year s event. CTMCA CEO Kevin Momberg said they had submitted all the relevant documents. After much deliberation, the permit for the Voorsmakie event was declined due to non-compliance on the part of the event organiser, he said. Our primary concern is the comfort and safety of our residents and visitors who come out in large numbers to support this event. As custodian of the applicable by-laws and policies, it would be remiss of us to transgress these and the event legislation. Momberg said the event s policy was developed and guided by applicable legislation and regulations, including the Safety at Sports and Recreational Events Act.He said it was the responsibility of the event organiser to apply for an event risk categorisation from the police as defined in Section 6 of the act. The city has been informed by the police that this event s grading certificate will be withdrawn due to non-compliance with the requirements in terms of the act, Momberg said, adding that the CTMCA would continue fighting to make sure that the event took place.-VINCENT CRUYWAGEN
