Gauteng is the smallest province in terms of area, but it hosts some of the most attractive tourist destinations in the country.Gauteng Tourism Authority spokesperson Barba Gaoganediwe says some of the best tourist attractions to visit this festive season are the Lion Park, Montecasino, Vilakazi Street in Soweto, the Cradle of Humankind, Moyo in Zoo Lake and Maboneng but that this is just a small sample of the myriad attractions that Gauteng boasts. The Vaal is becoming a very popular attraction with its water activities, picnic areas and bungee jumping opportunities, said Gaoganediwe.Gauteng is the third most visited province in the country, after Limpopo and Kwazulu Natal. Limpopo is the most visited due to the church conferences that are annually held in the province, Gaoganediwe said.
