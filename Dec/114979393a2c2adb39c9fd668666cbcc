The happenings in the ANC must not be reduced to mere anti-Zuma and pro-Zuma factions.Zuma is not that important and cannot be elevated above our people, above our revolution and above our ANC-led national liberation movement.To many of us, our pre-occupation in the struggle is our people, our revolution and our movement, not some greedy parasitic personalities bent on using our movement as a vehicle to capture the state and dispense patronage to their corrupt cronies and friends.In essence, the political differences in the ANC are about the soul of the National Democratic Revolution (NDR) and the soul of the ANC. They are about the soul of the NDR because at the heart of the NDR is the total liberation of black people in general and Africans in particular from centuries of socio-economic bondages, decades of colonialism of a special ype, and apartheid.The task of progressive forces in the ANC is to see to it that the NDR remains on track and that it is not re-routed to serve the narrow interests of the greedy parasitic elements such as the Guptas or the Ruperts. Clearly, the capture of state organs and, yes, certain leading figures in the ANC and the government, is one attempt to re-route our shared National Democratic Revolution.This by its very nature undermines the will of the people and the will of the primary motive forces of our revolution, and thus, understandably, the people and the motive forces of the revolution punished the ANC at the 2016 local government elections.The people and the primary motive forces of our revolution could see that the ANC leadership was no longer about the people, no longer about the revolution and no longer about the movement itself, but had come to serve some leading greedy parasites.There is no doubt that the millions of rands spent on the upgrade of one individual s house in Nkandla and the billions of rands deployed to many state-owned enterprises as bail-outs, should have been directed instead to change the lives of the people where those sums could have had a decisive impact on changing people s lives.The liberal perspective that the indecisive ANC national executive committee continues to advance after its recent meeting, that we must let things slide for the sake of unity, also saps the people and the primary motive forces of our revolution of confidence in the ANC.In this situation, the leadership of the ANC must choose between the people, the revolution and the movement, on the one hand, and the greedy parasites that happen to be in leadership positions in the ANC.Yes, the differences are about the soul of the ANC as a leader of our NDR.Yes, the ANC is a multi-class formation but biased towards the working class and this character, its working class bias, ought to be preserved. Should the ANC be led by forces committed to a right-wing agenda the NDR will be sold to the highest bidder.Against this background, the ANC must be reclaimed from the greedy parasites as led by Zuma. The ANC must then put the NDR back on track and revitalise the primary motive forces of our revolution to crush the selfish smash-and-grab parasitic tendency.As the New Tendency and the 1996 Class Project before it, the leading tendency also uses the approach of targeting communists and the SACP and captures some leading personalities from the trade union federation Cosatu.At the heart of this agenda is the intention to weaken the voices that are firm to defending and advancing the NDR, so that this tendency can freely take billions of rands to Dubai without anyone saying anything. The error of weakness that progressive force made following the Polokwane political moment was to take a less critical stance on the ANC-led alliance and allow opposition forces to lead the criticism of our own movement.This less critical stance, in the public domain in particular, was then taken for granted by leading characters of the selfish tendency who arrogantly assumed a green light to divert the NDR and rob the people.Benson Ngqentsu Benson Ngqentsu is the SACP s Brian Bunting district secretary and NUM regional organiser and writes in his personal capacity
