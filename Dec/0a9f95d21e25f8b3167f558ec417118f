THE Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has extended the deadline for submission of written public comments on the National Liquor Amendment Bill to December 15 while the Federated Hospitality Association of South Africa (Fedhasa) believes the act will only complicate the liquor regulatory environment even more.Minister of Trade and Industry Dr Rob Davies said the extension was the result of constructive consultative sessions that the department had with the portfolio committee on trade and industry and the South African Liquor Brandowners Association. The department also hosted a National Liquor Indaba in Gauteng last month where it was apparent that affected stakeholders and associations need more time to provide valuable inputs on the bill.The extension will afford all of the stakeholders and members of the public at large more time to share their ideas and proposals with us on the bill, Davies said.Federated Hospitality Association of south Africa (Fedhasa) chief executive Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa said this would complicate things as the country was already mired in the complexity more than 40 national and provincial liquor-related policies and regulations, as well as countless municipal by-laws.Fedhasa represents the interests of more than 10000 direct and associate members in the local hospitality industry including hotels, B&amp;Bs, guest houses, game lodges, restaurants, pubs, taverns shebeens, conference centres and casinos.In its submission to the DTI, Fedhasa called on the director-general to persuade provincial governments to adopt a standardised, pragmatic approach to all aspects of liquor licencing and liquor trade in SA.Meanwhile the department has been hosting consultative sessions for oral public submissions and comments throughout the country since October as part of the national roadshow aimed at soliciting inputs on the bill from members of the public.Next week the roadshow will stop in Lephalale, Moletjie, Mokopane and Musina in Limpopo.Last week the select committee on trade and international relations unanimously supported the Liquor Policy.The chairperson, Eddie Makue, said there was unanimity across all political party lines that the policy was important and would contribute towards responsible drinking.Makue said this would potentially deal with the aspects of safety and security in the broader society. We need to look at the detrimental impact alcohol has on our society and give consideration to raising the sin tax such that it becomes a deterrent to the abuse of alcohol, especially by young people, Makue said.The National Liquor Amendment Bill 2016, was published on September 30, Gazette No. 40319 for broader public consultation where interested parties are required to submit written comments within 30 calendar days from the date of publication.The closing date for the submission of comments was extended to Noveber 15 and again to November 30.-SELLO RABOTHATA
