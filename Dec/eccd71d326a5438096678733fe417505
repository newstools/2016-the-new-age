&nbsp;An investigation initiated as a safeguard to the surge of imports of frozen bone-in chicken pieces from the EU is at an advanced stage, the International Trade Administration Commission of South Africa (Itac) said yesterday.This as the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that there were concerns raised by the poultry industry about the rising number of imports into the country.One of the concerns is that a number of countries are experiencing high outbreaks of avian influenza and consequently, in line with the guidelines of the World Organisation for Animal Health, South Africa has placed a ban on poultry imports from Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, the Netherlands and Poland.The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is closely monitoring the developments and said it would take the appropriate action to address health and safety concerns.The government has been working with the domestic industry to address the challenges and a national committee has been established by the aforementioned departments to develop a comprehensive strategy.Over the past three years, upon application by Itac, a number of actions were taken by the government to address the challenges in the industry. The actions vary from an increase in tariffs covering a number of poultry products in line with South Africa s international commitments, imposing trade remedies where evidence indicates dumping of poultry in the South Africa market or where there is a surge in imports.In 2013, the import duty on a number of poultry products was increased significantly. Import duties for chicken from countries such as Brazil and the US are as follows: whole bird (82%), carcasses (31%), boneless cuts (12%), offal (30%) and bone-in portions (37%).These import duties are not applicable to imports from the EU since South Africa has a preferential trade agreement with the union.Last year, however, anti-dumping measures were imposed on frozen bone-in chicken pieces from Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.The two national departments are also working on opening new markets for poultry exports. Recently, new markets in the Middle East have been opened and present a further opportunity for exports.TNA Reporter
