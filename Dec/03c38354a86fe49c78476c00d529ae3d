Congolese crisis talks to ensure a peaceful transition of power were suspended Saturday, Catholic church negotiators said, announcing they would resume only a day after President Joseph Kabila&#8217;s last legal term in office ends.The announcement follows nearly a week of church-led negotiations between Kabila&#8217;s ruling power and opposition parties to determine a path forward after December 20, when Kabila&#8217;s second term ends.The Congolese constitution bans presidents from a third term, but Kabila has showed no signs of stepping down and no elections have yet been planned, leading international observers to fear the situation could descend into violence.AFP
