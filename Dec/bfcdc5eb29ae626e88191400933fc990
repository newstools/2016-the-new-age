The EU charged Facebook on Tuesday with providing &#8220;misleading&#8221; information when it sought approval for its blockbuster $22-billon buyout of the WhatsApp mobile messaging service .The commission said the EU&#8217;s greenlight of the buyout, announced in October 2014, was not put back into question but the social network could face hundreds of millions of euros in fines.&#8220;The European Commission has sent a Statement of Objections to Facebook alleging the company provided incorrect or misleading information during the Commission&#8217;s 2014 investigation&#8221; of the buyout, the EU&#8217;s executive arm said in a statement.With the charge, Facebook joins Google, Amazon and Microsoft among the US-based tech giants caught in major EU competition probes. Facebook is accused of misleading the EU in a claim that it was technically impossible for it to merge users between the two services.But in August, WhatsApp said that it would begin sharing data with Facebook, in a bid to allow better-targeted advertising and to fight spam on the platform. Earlier this year, the EU&#8217;s powerful competition chief Margarethe Vestager said she &#8220;will keep a close eye on how companies use data&#8221;. That veiled warning to tech firms came weeks after Vestager ordered Apple to pay back 13 billion euros in taxes and with her team running several cases against Google.&#8220;We respect the Commission&#8217;s process and are confident that a full review of the facts will confirm Facebook has acted in good faith,&#8221; a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.-AFP
