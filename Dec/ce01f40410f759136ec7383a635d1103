As far as South African football goes this year, Percy Tau is a revelation.The 22-year-old striker, who looked quite spooked at what was happening around him on the podium when Mamelodi Sundowns hoisted the CAF Champions League trophy, made a bit more history at the Fifa Club World Cup being held in Japan.Tau became the first and only South African to score at the prestigious tournament when he curled a beauty past Jeonbuk Hyundai during Sundowns heavy 4-1 loss yesterday.The scoreline made for little celebration, even though those keenly watching the tournament will agree that Tau s beautiful strike is the best of the tournament so far.Any young player making his debut at the world s biggest club competition, in addition to having won the Champions League, would be chuffed for scoring a memorable goal. But not Tau.A product of Sundowns academy, he is instead thinking about his team s missed chances and the need for Africa s Champions to play more at big tournaments like the Club WorldCup. The score doesn t reflect our big effort, Tau said. We tried harder than in the previous game. I still have a long way to go. I had many chances to score many goals during the match. I will get better. Following the Absa Premiership side s first participation at the Club World Cup, where they lost to Kashima Antlers 2-0 and Jeonbuk Hyundai 4-1, the Tshwane side must now return home to focus on the domestic league.A number of Sundowns players will start trickling home tonight, with others to be split into groups and due to arrive in the country tomorrow andSaturday. Sundowns play Polokwane City in a league match at Peter Mokaba Stadium next week.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
