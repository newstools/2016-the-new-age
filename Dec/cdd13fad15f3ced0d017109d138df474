With the fluctuating rand, rising petrol prices and tough financial times, many consumers are looking forward to some relief with an end-of-year bonus.While it s tempting to spend the cash injection on a holiday or expensive gifts, you ll be better off in the long run investing it or paying off debt.Graham Craggs, spokesperson for Budget Insurance said: We re not suggesting you don t spend any of your hard-earned bonus but it is a good opportunity to put yourself in a better financial position. Some advice: Don t spend your anticipated bonus before you get it. Also, it s taxable. Move your bonus to a different account so it s harder to spend. If you have debt with high interest rates such as credit cards and personal loans, pay them off. If your debt is manageable, invest your bonus in an easy-to-access emergency fund. You can save on payments in the long term by putting some of your bonus into your bond, to reduce the interest. If buying a home, put your bonus into an interest-bearing account towards a deposit.
