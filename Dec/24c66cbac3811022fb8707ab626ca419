Crystal Palace sacked manager Alan Pardew on Thursday after a run of eight Premier League defeats in their last 10 games left the south London club in 17th place just a point above the relegation zone.In a statement the club&#8217;s co-owner Steve Parish said: &#8220;I would like to put on record our sincere gratitude for the tremendous service Alan has given us, both in his time here as manager and previously as a player.&#8220;Following a fantastic second half of 2014/15, the 2015/16 season culminated in only narrowly missing out on winning the FA Cup as well as securing our Premier League place for a record-breaking fourth time.Pardew, a former Palace midfielder, was appointed in 2015.The former England manager Sam Allardyce, who lost his job as national team coach after becoming embroiled in a newspaper sting, has been tipped in the media as a possible replacement.&#8220;During his tenure Alan&#8217;s hard work and dedication were without question, he has improved so many areas of the club and we wish him the very best for the future.&#8220;With games now coming thick and fast over the holiday period the club are hoping to put someone in place as quickly as possible but have nothing to say about a replacement at this time.&#8221;-Reuters
