The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is unlikely to proceed with charges against four Hawks officers accused of kidnapping, intimidation and robbery related to SARS deputy director of law Vlok Symington at the SARS Pretoria offices in October.It emerged that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, led by the deputy director of investigations, Ntombi Gibson, submitted the docket to the NPA for prosecution but there was a lack of evidence and complications relating to variances in two sworn affidavits submitted by Symington to Gibson.A source close to the investigations said the complicating factor was that Symington s two affidavits were different, with deletions, omissions and additions. Another problem was that the chief legal officer of SARS, Kosie Louw, has not submitted a supporting statement.Louw had arrived at the SARS offices just as the Hawks-Symington meeting was concluding. He told investigators he didn t see anything and this weakened Symington s case, a source said.Louw, a former deputy head of SARS and the longest-serving member of the SARS executive committee, has since tendered his resignation.In his first sworn affidavit, Symington said he was aware the police members were from the Hawks under the command of a Brig Xaba while in his second affidavit he said he couldn t recall if they (Hawks) said they were from the Hawks or SAPS.The first affidavit omitted any reference to being kidnapped. I was held hostage, kidnapped in my own office environment. This gave me the shock of my life since I was experiencing it for the first time. &nbsp;-PETER RAMOTHWALA
