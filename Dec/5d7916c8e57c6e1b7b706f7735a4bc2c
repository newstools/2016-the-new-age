President Jacob Zuma has not yet received a report from the Commission of inquiry into suspended National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega&#8217;s fitness to hold office, his office said on Monday.The Presidency &#8220;will thus not comment on the alleged contents of the report which was released by a weekend newspaper. The Presidency has no knowledge of the report referred to in the media reports, Presidency spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga said in a statement.The City Press reported on Sunday that the Claasen Board of Inquiry established to look into Phiyega&#8217;s fitness to hold office has found that she&#8217;s not fit to hold office and she should be dismissed.The reports over the weekend also say Phiyega was found to have lied to the Marikana Commission of Inquiry.However the Presidency said they will inform the public as soon as the report is made available to the office of the President.The inquiry headed by judge Neels Claasen is the result of recommendations made by the Marikana Commission of Inquiry last year. The commission found the police plan to disarm and disperse more than 3 000 armed mineworkers was flawed.The final recommendations were, among others, that an inquiry be set up to determine whether Phiyega, in taking the decision to use the tactical response team police unit, should have foreseen that it might end in deaths.Her remarks on the day after 33 mineworkers were shot dead, where she said police had done nothing wrong , allegedly amounted to an endorsement for the police conduct during the strike.Her overall testimony was in keeping with the office which she holds and the discharge of her duties commensurate therewith.Police commissioner Riah Phiyega suspendedThe report she prepared and gave to the President of the Republic on August 16, 2012 and the media statement issued on August 17, was allegedly deliberately amended to conceal the fact that there were two shooting incidents.Meanwhile, Phiyega&#8217;s legal counsel said they will approach the Claasen board of inquiry to find out when the report will be made available to them. They added that they will not be commenting on the report until the findings had been made available.-TNA Reporter
