The Department of Basic Education&#8217;s 3-day Indaba to strengthen teaching and learning of school mathematics in the country, will commence in Pretoria on Monday.Under the theme &#8220;meaningful and effective mathematics teaching and Learning: In search of the South African Pedagogical Identity&#8221;, the department will develop a South African pedagogical-content knowledge outlook that will inform teaching and learning of Maths.Furthermore, it will engage and solicit intellectual views, expertise of reputable maths education practitioners and researchers and contextualise international and regional best practices for South Africa&#8217;s maths education milieu.The department is also expected to review its policy on the mathematics pass mark.It was reported that learners in Grade 7 to Grade 9 will be eligible to pass the current grade even though they don&#8217;t pass maths.However, the department refuted the reports which claim 20% as the pass mark for maths, with learners being condoned if they pass all other subjects.&#8220;The Department of Basic Education has noted the continued inaccurate media reports regarding the decision to condone learners who did not meet the requisite mathematics requirements for progression to the next grade in the senior phase (Grade 7 to 9).&#8220;There is no such thing as a 20% pass mark for mathematics and there has been no change in the progression policy to reflect such. The continued media reports to this effect are therefore unfortunate and indeed misleading.This decision is only applicable to senior phase learners and only applicable for the 2016 cohort of learners while we are at this point of policy review,&#8221; the department said.-TNA Reporter
