Danish national Peter Frederiksen, who appeared in the Free State High Court on Friday on charges that includes conspiracy to murder, possession of illegal firearms and child pornography, has pleaded with the court to allow him see his children.Frederiksen made yet another brief appearance after he finally acquired a Legal Aid lawyer to represent him in the trial that is expected to resume next year in April after it was postponed to February 24, 2017, for pre-trial.During his appearance in a packed court, Frederiksen asked judge Soma Naidoo to allow him to receive a rare visit from his children, whom he has not seen since his arrest last year September. Please your worship, please give me a chance to see my children. It s been a while since I last saw them and I miss them terribly, he said.Judge Naidoo responded by saying that is an arrangement that should be facilitated by his lawyer and correctional services. I do not think that would be a problem, just talk to your lawyer and she will make the necessary arrangements, Naidoo said and added that she was pleased that Frederiksen finally got legal representation ahead of the trial.Leona Smit from Legal Aid was assigned to represent Frederiksen after a lengthy battle to acquire a legal representative.The 64 year old was initially not keen on being represented by Legal Aid but Naidoo insisted at his previous appearance that he should get help from Legal Aid or represent himself.Frederiksen told the court in the past that his family had promised to settle his legal bills but it turned out that they were only committing to help him with R50000. I am glad we finally have come to an understanding that the case will be on the roll, Naidoo said. The case is postponed to February 24 next year when we should be setting the trial date, she said.Naidoo said the projected time for the trial is April next year and is expected to last at least eight weeks.Frederiksen was arrested last year in September after police raided his house at Langenhoven Park in Bloemfontein.Small packets containing 21 clitorises and an assortment of tools used to slice off the women s body parts were found in his freezer.The Dane is facing a total of 59 charges including several counts of illegally removing human tissues.He is also accused of conspiring to commit murder after he was linked to the murder of his wife Anna Molise.Molise was gunned down in her home town of Maseru, Lesotho, last year in October, a few weeks after Frederiksen was arrested.Police linked him to the murder of Molise who was expected to be the star witness in the case.He is also charged with illegally dealing with firearms, several counts of assault with the intention to cause bodily harm and other counts of manufacturing and distribution of weapons.The ANC Women s League members, who have been attending the case since it started, continued to call for Frederiksen to receive life in prison for violating women s rights.&#8211;MICHAEL TLHAKUDI
