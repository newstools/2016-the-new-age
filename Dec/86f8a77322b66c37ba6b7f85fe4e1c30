After winning the 200m butterfly at the 13th Fina World Championships in Canada on Wednesday, South African swimmer Chad le Clos dedicated his victory to his parents, who are both battling cancer.Le Clos defeated Thomas Shields of the US and Japan s Daiya Seto to win the title for the third time in the competition at the WFCU Centre in Windsor.He registered a time of 1:48.76, beating his closest rival Shields by 0.74 of a second.Le Clos went to the prize giving ceremony to collect his due, but returned without a gold medal hanging around his neck.The Durban-born swimmer had handed the loot to his mother Geraldine, while his father Bert, world-famous for his effusive pool-side celebrations each time Chad races, was the recipient of his son s mascot.Just before the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in August, Le Clos revealed that his mother and father had both been diagnosed with the disease.However, the 24 year old said it was never part of his plans to give his winnings to his parents, who travelled from South Africa to Canada to support their son, as has been their habit since the swimmer burst into prominence a few years ago. No, it was not planned. It just happened, it came from my heart, Le Clos said.The Olympic medallist also won silver in the 200m freestyle on Wednesday, finishing behind Taehwan Park of South Korea in a time of 1:41.65. Park stormed in to touch first in a time of 1:41.03.At the Olympics in Brazil, Le Clos won two silver medals, a feat that was disappointing based on his own high standard. For me, Rio was very disappointing. There are very few positives to take from there, Le Clos said. I make no excuses for what happened in Rio. I was in good shape, the best shape of my life, but things went wrong. There were reasons why but I won t speak on that in front of the camera. Champions must accept defeat humbly.
