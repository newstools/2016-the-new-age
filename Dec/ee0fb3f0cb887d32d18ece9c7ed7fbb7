Veteran producer Frank Marshall says 2016 is shaping up to be his biggest year &#8212; quite a claim for the man who, alongside Steven Spielberg, gave the world &#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; and &#8220;Back to the Future.&#8221;The five-time Oscar nominee defined the blockbuster for a generation of cinemagoers alongside the legendary director and their artistic partner Kathleen Kennedy &#8212; whom Marshall went on to marry.As the founders of Amblin Entertainment, the trio reigned supreme from 1982&#8217;s &#8220;ET: The Extra-Terrestrial&#8221; through a string of milestones including &#8220;Gremlins,&#8221; &#8220;The Goonies&#8221; and &#8220;Who Framed Roger Rabbit.&#8221;He&#8217;d be forgiven for resting on his laurels at age 70, but Marshall revealed he is busier than ever as AFP caught up with him to discuss the release of &#8220;Jason Bourne&#8221; on DVD and Blu-ray.&#8220;We&#8217;re just finishing &#8216;Assassin&#8217;s Creed&#8217; and we&#8217;re talking about how we&#8217;re going to sell the movie and the publicity campaign,&#8221; he responded when asked about his schedule for the day.&#8220;And we&#8217;re working on &#8216;Sully&#8217; for the awards season so I&#8217;m pretty busy. The other thing: &#8216;Jurassic World II&#8217; is in pre-production so I work on that early in the morning because they are in London.&#8221;Add Spielberg&#8217;s &#8220;The BFG&#8221; to all that work and it&#8217;s been a packed year for the father of two.Film finance website Box Office Mojo attributes worldwide ticket receipts of just under $10 billion for Marshall&#8217;s body of work, which includes directing stints, most notably on &#8220;Arachnophobia&#8221; and &#8220;Congo.&#8221;&#8211; Sportsman &#8211;&#8220;When I direct, it&#8217;s a 24/7 focus and I have a couple of projects that I&#8217;m considering directing, but I love producing,&#8221; he tells AFP.&#8220;This is really my biggest year with four movies out so that&#8217;s been exciting and very satisfying.&#8221;Born in Los Angeles, Marshall excelled in both music and sport, running track and cross-country for UCLA before entering his film career as an assistant to director Peter Bogdanovich.His 1980s output alongside Spielberg and Kennedy include critical hits such as &#8220;The Color Purple,&#8221; &#8220;Empire of the Sun&#8221; and &#8220;Always,&#8221; which featured a cameo by Audrey Hepburn in her last role.In 1991, Kennedy and Marshall branched out to form the prosaically-titled Kennedy/Marshall Company, producing 35 movies including &#8220;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,&#8221; M. Night Shyamalan&#8217;s &#8220;The Sixth Sense&#8221; and the &#8220;Bourne&#8221; franchise.Among the extras for &#8220;Jason Bourne,&#8221; released on DVD and Blu-ray next week, is a behind-the-scenes featurette about filming a car chase on the Las Vegas Strip that Marshall describes as among his most challenging.&#8220;For 12 nights in a row we had two crews working 24 hours a day,&#8221; he told AFP. &#8220;It actually took four hours just to close down the Strip before we could even shoot. It was quite a large undertaking.&#8221;Marshall became sole head of the couple&#8217;s company when Kennedy was made chairwoman of Lucasfilm in 2012, taking on responsibility for the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; sequels and spin-offs.&#8211; &#8216;Comfortable&#8217; &#8211;The couple &#8212; who have 13 Oscar nominations between them and yet no statuettes &#8212; live in a $10 million beachfront pad in Malibu, in what Marshall describes as a &#8220;very comfortable home life.&#8221;His next big project &#8212; perhaps his biggest ever &#8212; will be &#8220;Jurassic World II,&#8221; which begins shooting in London in February.Co-written by Colin Trevorrow &#8212; who helmed &#8220;Jurassic World&#8221; and is slated to direct 2019&#8217;s &#8220;Star Wars IX&#8221; &#8212; the film carries a weight of expectation after its predecessor made an astonishing $1.7 billion.The internet has been abuzz with rumors of a darker episode than previous movies in the &#8220;Jurassic&#8221; stable, featuring weaponized dinosaurs.&#8220;Nothing to report,&#8221; was Marshall&#8217;s judicious response to questions about the direction of the new movie, although he revealed a &#8220;Jurassic World III&#8221; was already &#8220;at the ideas stage.&#8221;Marshall will also be producing as Harrison Ford picks up the famous fedora and bullwhip for &#8220;Indiana Jones V&#8221; in 2019.Whatever the filmmaker goes on to do after that, he intends to remain faithful to his formula for blockbuster success.&#8220;It sounds really simple but you have to have a good story, one that people want to continue to see&#8230; Certainly that&#8217;s the case with both Indiana Jones and Jason Bourne,&#8221; he says.&#8220;They love these characters and they want to see what they are going to do next. For me that&#8217;s the key &#8211; the story.&#8221;&nbsp;AFP
