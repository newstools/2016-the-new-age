RACISM reared its ugly head when a white Johannesburg man insulted President Jacob Zuma and the DA-controlled Saldanha Bay municipality allegedly blocked access roads for blacks to the beachfront.Ben Sasonof from Sandton made a racist comment about black beach-goers on Facebook. Sasonof at the weekend posted a comment, referring to a photo showing thousands of beach-goers at a Durban beach. Eh eh wena must have smelt like the inside of Zuma s a**hole. This has raised an angry reaction from a lot of people who have called on Sasonof to face the music for denigrating the president of the country. Nobody had, by yesterday, laid any complaints. I can confirm that no one has laid a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission, spokesperson Gail Smith said.The racist comment came shortly after the west coast ANC region lambasted the DA-controlled Saldanha Bay municipality for blocking access roads to the beachfront and depriving the community of a basic human right.West coast ANC regional spokesperson, Sammy Claassen, said this despicable act happened on the Day of Reconciliation, celebrated nationally on Friday last week. This was apparently done without proper consultation and had caused a huge outcry from all spectrums and people have raised their utter resentment on social media.The DA provincial communications manager, Anneke Scheepers, said no access to the beachfront had been denied to any person, adding there had indeed been consultation with the community as it was the residents in the area who requested the prevention of alcohol consumption.As such, it was not the road that was closed but rather alcohol that was monitored.news@thenewage.co.za
