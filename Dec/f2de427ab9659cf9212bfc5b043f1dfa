Lentswe Book Club is a non-profit organisation based in Pampierstad that aims to inspire people to read.The book club is spearheaded by Bongile Norman, a vibrant young person living in the township. Together with a close friend, Norman took brave steps in October 2014 to start a project in a community where reading is far from being a priority. We rely on individuals to read in their own corners and request that they share that with us, Norman said. The discussions that follow are meant to make one think more broadly, be assertive and, most importantly, seek to know more by reading. The book club hosts monthly meetings at Pampierstad Youth Centre and has seen the number of participants growing steadily. The club welcomes two guests during every gathering one sharing a book and the other a poem. We encourage reading because of the knowledge gained from it, Norman said. Lentswe Book Club believes that there should be at least one book club per residential area and we try to duplicate our activities elsewhere. At the gatherings, book club members seek to discuss culture, religion, morality and relationships.The book club has also hosted poetry competitions in a bid to empower unpublished writers.Well-known regional authors and poets often attend he meetings and Norman says plans to establish a writers guild are afoot.LEBOGANG RABOTOLOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
