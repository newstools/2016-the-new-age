What many political and economic pundits have missed in the unending stream of commentary on the national minimum wage for South Africa, is what lies at the heart of the discussion the recognition of one s humanity.The national minimum wage advisory panel appointed by the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) has proposed an introductory R20 an hour wage, which translates to R3 500 per month.This comes after nearly two years of haggling between the social partners at Nedlac.The announcement, which was no doubt the outcome of painstaking concessions between the government, business, labour and community constituencies at Nedlac has elicited a flurry of commentary, some reactionary, some throwing caution to the wind but few have explored the impact a national minimum wage could have on the human condition.The announcement comes at a time when the country s Gini coefficient continues to spiral out of proportion. With an apartheid wage gap in the workplace still having its tentacles hooked on the bottom rung of the ladder of economic development, upward mobility for blacks in the socio-economic stream remains a dream deferred.While 54% of full-time employees (5.5 million workers) continue to eke out a living on a salary below the working poor line of just more than R4000, the national minimum wage won t be a panacea to closing the country s growing wage gap, tackling working poverty inequality while mitigating significant economic consequences. However, the debate is a source of great optimism about the country s economic potential.It is plausible that the implementation of a new wage floor below which no employer can wriggle out of paying employees their fair share, could be a significant step towards improving employee wellness, which is conducive to productivity in the workplace.While an unscrupulous employer may be averse to hearing this, there is no doubt an inextricable link between a certain level of material comfort and employee wellness.Material factors such as decent shelter, a healthy environment, nutritious food and clean water among others point to the dignity we all deserve as human beings. This dignity is affirmed through among other things, better wages.This suggests that at a primary level, the debate on the national minimum wage is about fairness, redress and social justice in an economy that regards its workforce as cannon fodder.A national minimum wage, although not a living wage is a line in the sand against the skewed distribution of resources in a country where conversations about redress and balance continue to be discussed without agreement.Those opposed to the R3 500 per month wage floor have raised concerns that the implementation of the amount by the government would be akin to killing the goose that lays the golden egg as the wage could trigger job losses.However, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa told members of the National Assembly last week that the government was aware of the potential adverse effects that a wage hike could have on job creation. It is for this he reiterated that businesses who could not afford the increase could qualify for exemptions. The real matter here is. is it something we are prepared to countenance or are we saying that we want to lift the livelihoods of our people?, Ramaphosa said.In addition, business owners who employed 10 or fewer employees would be given a further 12 months to adjust to the new level.This suggests that a new wage floor was not designed to batter the balance sheets of businesses. Instead, support systems and mechanisms will be put in place to create an enabling environment for its implementation.Speaking at the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration 20th anniversary celebrations in Boksburg last week, CCMA governing body member Sifiso Lukhele said that it was an indictment of our society that 22 years into democracy, a national minimum wage had yet to be implemented. The lack of a standard is what is wrong with our country. When you ve got nothing as a foundation, where do you grow from? It has been wrong for us to reach 20 years without even that. A mark in the sand of some sort will guide us. As a country we should literally mark this moment. Bonolo SelebanoBonolo Selebano is a political reporter for The New Age
