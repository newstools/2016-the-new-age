&nbsp;Australia&#8217;s Andrew Dodt takes a two-shot lead into the final round of the Australian PGA Championship after another sub-par round at Royal Pines on Saturday.Dodt maintained his overnight two-shot buffer after rounds of 65-67 to stay in front of the European Tour co-sanctioned event.Australia&#8217;s Ashley Hall and American Harold Varner III both carded eagles as they attempted to chase Dodt down, with Hall drawing level twice on the back nine.But Dodt held his ground and five birdies and three bogeys in a round of 70 got him to 14 under, two shots clear of Hall and Varner.World No.7 Adam Scott and fellow Australian John Senden were at 10-under as the top-5 broke away from the chasing pack.Dodt made just seven of 20 cuts in a frustrating 2016 European Tour season but a win on Sunday would hand him a third European Tour title.&#8220;It would be one of my biggest achievements, for sure,&#8221; Dodt said.&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought about it a couple of times this week but you don&#8217;t want to get ahead of yourself. You just want to play each round.&#8220;It would be huge. All the top guys have won the Australian PGA, so it would be nice to put my name alongside them.&#8221;England&#8217;s Steve Webster equalled the low-round of the week with a 65 to get to six under alongside local hope Scott Hend and American Julian Suri.AFP
