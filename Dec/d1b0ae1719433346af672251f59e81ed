A group of people from an informal settlement are forging ahead to have a section of the Intimidation Act declared unlawful.In a legal battle dating back to 2012, with assistance from the Socio-Economic Rights Institute, Makause residents in Ekurhuleni have filed an application for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeals after they failed in the High Court last month.A criminal case of intimidation against them, opened by a station commander, is still pending.In 2012, the residents, led by Alfred Moyo had planned to march to Primrose Police Station in protest against police brutality.However, during a meeting between the residents and the station commander, it is alleged that Moyo threatened to make sure that police officers are removed , threatened a repeat of Marikana and promised bloodshed if their grievances were not attended to.He reportedly charged at the female station commander too.That resulted in several residents being arrested and spending a night in jail after the station commander accused them of intimidating her. They were charged based on section 1(1)(b) of the Intimidation Act and later released on R1000 bail. If convicted, Moyo could spend up to 10 years in jail.Assisted by the Centre for Applied Legal Studies, the residents submitted in court that the section in dispute criminalises any speech or conduct, which creates a subjective state of fear in any person whether or not the fear itself is reasonable and whether or not the conduct or speech in question was intended to create fear.In the appeal application, Moyo says the High Court ought to have held that the section criminalises any conduct or utterance that has the effect of creating a subjective state of fear in any person, irrespective of the purpose or intent of the person engaging in the conduct or making the utterance. The court ought to have held, accordingly, that the section constitutes a far-reaching invasion of the right to freedom of expression, for which no acceptable justification had been advanced. The Court ought to have declared the section unconstitutional, Moyo s appeal application reads.DUDU DUBE
