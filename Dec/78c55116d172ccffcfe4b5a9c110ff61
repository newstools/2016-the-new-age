Not many coaches in the Premiership are as gracious in defeat as Free State Stars coach Giovanni Solinas.The Italian mentor, who side were hammered 4-1 by Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday, has wished the South African and African champions well for the Club World Cup in Japan from Thursday.Perhaps the fact that it is fast becoming not much of a shame for local clubs to lose to Sundowns played a role in the Ea Lla Koto coach not holding some resentment.The Italian also warned Mosimane s side that playing in Japan will be like a war. It will be very difficult there. I congratulated Pitso for winning the Champions League. I said I liked not just how they win their games but their manner of playing. It will be war at the Club World Cup, but why can they not win it? I remember TP Mazembe made a miracle and got to the final against Inter Milan, Solinas said. Why not Sundowns?I wish them all the best and hope they continue to play well at the Club World Cup as they have been playing in Africa. It will definitely be difficult, but it is possible. It can happen. The Stars coach, who is still unhappy that his club released good players and did not acquire experienced replacements, said it was difficult and frustrating for him to compete against well assembled sides. For me, it is necessary to bring in five quality players in January if we are to survive and meet our targets. The league is strong this season. All the clubs are tough. It is difficult to have a small car and compete in Formula One. To compete in Formula One, you need a Formula One car. Stars are second from bottom with eight points from 12 matches.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANEmmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
