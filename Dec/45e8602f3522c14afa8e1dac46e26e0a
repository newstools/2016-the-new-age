The Western Cape High Court has declared the appointment of Hlaudi Motsoeneng as Group Executive of Corporate Affairs at the South African Broadcasting Cooperation(SABC) unlawful and irrational.High Court Judge Owen Rogers on Monday ruled that Motsoeneg should not hold any position at the public broadcaster and to begin a new disciplinary proceeding against him.According to Rogers, Motsoeneng is not allowed to hold any position at the SABC until the Public Protector&#8217;s report has been set aside or disciplinary proceedings against him are concluded.Hlaudi is unemployed @sabc, new D.C.Must be instituted.He must pay legal fees personal. Victory for the rule of law and constitutionalism. Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) December 12, 2016In September the Democratic Alliance(DA) launched a court bid against the decision to appoint Motsoeneng as group executive of corporate affairs.Last year the same court found Motsoeneng&#8217;s appointment as Chief Operating Officer also irrational and unlawful following the outcomes of a probe by the Public Protector.The Protector had found that Motsoeneng had engaged in fraud when he, among others, allegedly lied about having a matric certificate on his CV.Back in September a court bid by Motsoeneng to the Supreme Court of Appeal to have the ruling set aside was dismissed.The news comes while the inquiry into the SABC Boards fitness to hold office resumes for the fourth day.Meanwhile the South African Communist Party says the SABC should refrain from wasting public funds on a appeal by Motsoeneng.&#8221; While respecting the right to appeal, the SACP is calling on the SABC to abide by the law and to refrain from wasting public resources.&#8221; said SACP spokesperson Alex Mashilo in a statement.The SACP has also called on parliament to extend the scope of its current inquiry into the fitness of the SABC board to hold office.&#8221; Private interests, such as MultiChoice, that have been pursuing wealth accumulation from the decay and collapse of governance at the SABC must also be held accountable &#8221; said the SACP.-TNA Reporter
