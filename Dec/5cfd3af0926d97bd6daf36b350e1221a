Over the last week and a half since the commencement of this committee s inquiry into the SABC board, a number of statements have been raised by the witnesses, which I feel must be corrected.You will recall that when the Zuma administration took over in 2009 from the previous administration, the SABC s governance and financial health was in tatters. In fact, the SABC experienced corporate governance crises in late 2006 when there was alleged interference in the appointment of the board and the executives.You must be aware that the communications sector has a set of rules, which apply almost universally in terms of how the sector is regulated. This is precisely to safeguard the constitutional provisions of fairness. Therefore, I was surprised that the SABC, as a witness, omitted to tell the committee about the existence of these checks and balances, instead witnesses proposed an internal ombudsman.The SABC is further obliged to comply with rules governing broadcasting services, which is monitored by an independent body. The SABC always encourages its viewers to challenge any content aired on all its platforms, which may be an offence, unfair and so on to report such irregularities to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa.So, with due respect, when people talk about an internal ombudsman, what they do not say is that such an establishment of a stand-alone structure or the internal ombudsman mechanism will not be recognised by National Association of Broadcasters and the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) as per the provisions of the Electronic Communications Act.We need to also remind this committee that when the DA submitted a memorandum of demands to my office as well as to the chief whip of the majority party signed by the honourable Van Damme present here today, the DA was clear that this party only supported mainly white journalists and one Indian journalist.In the DA memorandum, the names of the following journalists were written; Jacques Steenkamp, Foeta Krige, Suna Venter and Krivani Pillay only.The names of Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki, Lukhanyo Calata, Ms Mthimkhulu, and others were never mentioned. We will provide the committee the memorandum of demands as evidence to this effect.I have never interfered with the editorial decisions of the SABC, I do not run the SABC. Perhaps, I offered my advice during the Imbizo programme as there were areas of focus I felt needed public scrutiny. The allegations by Ms Thandile (sic) are based on hearsay.The process to review the editorial policy of the SABC had not been complied with and as the committee at the time, we were concerned that the provisions of periodic updating of the policy had not happened regularly at the SABC.So the process to review was started by predecessors but implemented in my tenure.The SABC is required in terms of the act to develop news and editorial policies. It also makes provision for the SABC to ensure that there is public participation in the development of such a policy by inviting and considering public comments on such draft policies.Stakeholders, including political parties, groups such as SOS and others were all afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed amendments to the editorial policy.The policy was approved by the board of directors of the SABC for implementation by management.What we witnessed pre-election was undue pressure on the part of a certain section of the society to force changes to the already approved policy and we believed that if allowed, it was going to erode and influence the editorial independence of the SABC.If you asked a journalist or NGO to give you a relevant clause of censorship in the new policy, none will be able to show you, despite the fact that the policy is easily accessible on the SABC website. This is because there is no clause like a so-called censorship the SABC does not have such.Some members of Parliament and the witnesses have said I did not submit this policy to Parliament. The act is clear, it only requires that such information be lodged by the board not the minister to Icasa alone, not Parliament, unless if we want to amend the act.In my own initiative, I personally sent a copy of the editorial policy to honourable Van Damme to show that there was nothing untoward.I therefore cannot be unfairly and wrongly accused of the breach of legislative prescripts, which are not in existence.I am disappointed when some of your witnesses happened to be former board members (Ronnie Lubisi) who do not know what is the legislated board quorum requirements.Let me answer the question on the public protectors report in two ways that both the preliminary and final reports were submitted to the SABC before my tenure in 2013 and 2014. Safe to say that I emphasised the importance of the adhering to the public protector s report.When I met the board for the first time shortly after my appointment on July 2, I was fortunate that I knew the weaknesses of the SABC as I have served on the portfolio committee on communications in parliament.One of the various areas of the recommendations in which I participated in my time in Parliament, is that we constantly offered to the SABC our advice for the ensuring stability both in the old Ministry of Communications and all its entities and such recommendation were to be followed up by the fifth Parliament.Nobody mentioned here that recently, in the meeting with the committee in October, I have refused to appoint him (Hlaudi Motsoeneng) as the acting chief operating officer after the board had recommended that he assume the position in an acting position, after the SCA had ruled against his appeal.The matter of the contract (SABC-Multichoice) was signed before my time in 2013. We have to understand that around 2005, Icasa granted/approved licencing of the SABC s two channels, SABC 4 and 5.Since then, Parliament and the national Treasury failed to secure the funding of R60m necessary for the SABC to implement the vision in line with the preparations of the DTT.The deal between the SABC and Multichoice has culminated in the SABC getting R500m, which it has utilised to run the 24 hours news channel in preparation for the digital terrestrial television.The matters was cleared by Icasa, the regulator which exonerated the SABC and Multichoice because no national archives were sold to Multichoice, we need to understand this.Despite this, on April 21 last year, the ministry appeared before Parliament to discuss issues related to the SABC and MultiChoice deal.The minister and the Icasa CEO said the complaint lodged with the Competition Commission against the SABC in connection with the selling of SABC archives had been withdrawn because it was maliciously based on misleading information.Faith MuthambiThis is an edited version of Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi s address to Parliament s ad hoc committee on the SABC
