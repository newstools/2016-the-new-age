A topic which she has openly said she supports.At the end of the story she said: &#8220;Now I can say I still haven&#8217;t had an abortion, but I wish I had.&#8221;The comment didn&#8217;t go down well, many of her followers took to Twitter to express their anger about her remarks.Lena Dunham&#8217;s comments on abortion are ironic considering she is the personification of the word &#8220;accident.&#8221; Chrismas Ray Gun (@ChrisRGun) December 21, 2016Why haven&#8217;t you responded to your critics @lenadunham? More importantly, why are you still in the US? Even liberals don&#8217;t want you. Yikes! pic.twitter.com/uiAT5PjqsN Irma Hinojosa (@latinaafortrump) December 21, 2016Lena Dunham already sexually abused a child and now she wishes she&#8217;d killed one too. &#8220;Disturbed&#8221; doesn&#8217;t begin to describe this woman. Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) December 21, 2016She later responded with a lengthy Instagram post to apologise for her comment.&#8220;My latest podcast episode was meant to tell a multifaceted story about reproductive choice in America, to explain the many reasons women do or don&#8217;t choose to have children and what bodily autonomy really means. I&#8217;m so proud of the medley of voices in the episode. I truly hope a distasteful joke on my part won&#8217;t diminish the amazing work of all the women who participated. My words were spoken from a sort of &#8220;delusional girl&#8221; persona I often inhabit, a girl who careens between wisdom and ignorance (that&#8217;s what my TV show is too) and it didn&#8217;t translate.That&#8217;s my fault. I would never, ever intentionally trivialize the emotional and physical challenges of terminating a pregnancy. My only goal is to increase awareness and decrease stigma. I take reproductive choice in America more seriously than I take literally anything else, and therefore own full responsibility for any words I speak that don&#8217;t convey this truth clearly. I know plenty of people will never like a thing that leaves my lips, mea culpas or no, but this apology is for the women who have placed their trust in me. You mean everything to me. My life is and always will be devoted to reproductive justice and freedom. You know how in some households you curse and have to put money in a jar? Well in mine, if you mess up your pro-choice messaging you have to give a sizable donation to abortion funds,&#8221; she captioned
