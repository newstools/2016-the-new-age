Globally , the trend of giving is growing especially among high net-worth (wealthy) people , with 91% making charitable donations last year and 83% planning to donate as much or more over the next three years.Kerrin Land, CEO at Old Mutual Wealth, cautions that donors should be mindful with their philanthropic efforts, ensuring support of causes that promise to make a sustainable difference.A recent Nedbank report reveals that while 88% of wealthy locals donated money, time or goods to the combined value of R7bn to charities last year, more than half of these donors did not have a budget or planned approach to giving and that 70% do not measure the impact of their contributions. While each individual will be motivated to give for different reasons, the majority donated to a cause because they believe they are making a difference (44%), want to give back to the community (27%), or for fulfilment and satisfaction (44%). Only 18% were driven mainly by tax benefits.However, 67% of these givers said deciding where to donate was their greatest challenge, followed by ensuring that the donation had its intended impact (37%). Indiscriminate giving can be ineffective both for that of the charitable cause and the aspirations behind the reason to donate, says Land. In the past 15 years, the number of wealthy people on the African continent has grown by 145%, increasing the possibility of philanthropic activity across the region.As individuals prepare to give to those less fortunate these holidays, Land emphasises the importance of strategic giving. The Wealth-X and Arton Capital Major Giving Index shows philanthropic financial donations are increasingly being channelled towards impact giving, which ranges from venture philanthropy, micro finance and impact investing to job creation.Land says people wishing to donate should identify what they are passionate about, how they want to make a difference, and then set up a plan to ensure that contributions are effective. A scattergun approach, with small contributions spread across a wide variety of different causes, is less meaningful than a sustainable, ongoing relationship with a few well-chosen causes.Donors may also be able to offer their skills and experience, thereby further leveraging the power of the monetary donation. Skills are often in short supply in a charitable institution, including budgeting, capital management, project management and legal matters, or even introducing contacts.
