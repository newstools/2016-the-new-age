Influential midfielder Philippe Coutinho was making encouraging progress from an ankle injury but will not be rushed back to boost Liverpool&#8217;s Premier League title aspirations, manager Juergen Klopp has said.The 24-year-old Brazilian, who was initially expected to be out for five to six weeks, has been on the sidelines since sustaining the injury during the 2-0 win over Sunderland at Anfield last month.&#8220;It would be cool. He is improving a lot,&#8221; Klopp told British media when asked if Coutinho could be back for the clash against Manchester City at Anfield on New Year&#8217;s Eve.&#8220;He is off his crutches since the West Ham United game (on Dec. 11), when we left the stadium he was walking in front without them.&#8221;Coutinho said he has set his sights on making his return against City.Klopp, however, insisted the midfielder will not be rushed back into action.&#8220;We will have to see,&#8221; the German manager added.&#8220;No idea at the moment. I never rush a player back. I&#8217;m the most patient person in Liverpool. I always wait for someone. I can&#8217;t rush it.&#8221;In Coutinho&#8217;s absence, Liverpool have had mixed results, having lost at Bournemouth and being held to a home draw by West Ham United before getting back to winning ways at Middlesbrough on Wednesday.Liverpool, who are second in the league, are nine points behind leaders Chelsea but have a game in hand and face Merseyside rivals Everton at Goodison Park on Monday.-Reuters
