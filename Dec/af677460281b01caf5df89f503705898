More than 30 people died when a fuel tanker crashed into other vehicles and burst into flames outside the town of Naivasha in Kenya late on Saturday night, officials said.&#8220;At 5am the death toll was 33 but the search is still on,&#8221; said Pius Masai of Kenya&#8217;s National Disaster Unit. He added that rescuers were continuing to comb the area for bodies. Masai said the accident involved &#8220;over 11 vehicles burnt&#8221; when the tanker rammed into others on the road and caught fire.Kenya&#8217;s Red Cross said the driver had lost control of the fuel tanker which then crashed into other vehicles and &#8220;burst into flames&#8221;.A passenger minibus and a police truck were among the vehicles gutted by the ferocious flames.The accident occurred at Karai at the bottom of a long downward hill on the busy Nairobi-Nakuru highway, the main cross-country road leading from Kenya&#8217;s capital to the west of the country and on to Uganda.Police and witnesses said the truck with Ugandan registration plates was travelling fast when it hit a speed bump and then lost control ramming into others.At least 50 people injured in the accident have been received at a private hospital in Naivasha.Witnesses described a fireball engulfing the vehicles with passengers inside. After fire fighters put out the flames rescue workers collected bodies from among the wreckage of charred cars strewn across the highway.&#8211; &#8216;Like a horror movie&#8217; &#8211;&#8220;It&#8217;s a terrible incident, people are burnt, some in their cars and others as they tried to escape,&#8221; said a police officer on the scene.George Rono was driving on the highway when he saw the tanker crash into other vehicles.&#8220;We survived by luck because we saw it happen,&#8221; Rono said. &#8220;We heard vehicles hooting simultaneously then a loud burst that was followed by fire, that&#8217;s when I swerved my car and jumped out, when fire started spreading, but luckily it didn&#8217;t get to where we were.&#8221;Rono&#8217;s passenger, who did not want to be named, described the intensity of the blaze.&#8220;The fire was so huge you couldn&#8217;t move closer until the fire brigade came and helped put it out. All the vehicles around here were burning,&#8221; he said.Some survivors were treated on the scene by civilians and the Red Cross while others were taken to hospital. Corpses were put in body bags and loaded into pick-up trucks.&#8220;It is like a horror movie,&#8221; said Jane Muthoni, a shopkeeper who works close to the scene of the accident and rushed there soon after it happened to try to help people escape their cars.&#8220;It will haunt me for a long time, imagining that huge fire where people were burning, and now I have seen some seated in their vehicles dead,&#8221; she said.The busy highway is notorious for deadly accidents. In 2009 over 100 people were killed and 200 injured elsewhere on the same road after a petrol tanker overturned and local people had gathered to collect the leaking fuel when a fire ignited.Given the scale of Saturday&#8217;s disaster it is expected that the death toll may rise. The accident comes as Kenya is in the throes of a nationwide doctors&#8217; strike.-AFP
