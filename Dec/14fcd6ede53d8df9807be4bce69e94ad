For any other athlete winning two silver medals at the Rio Olympics would be a great achievement but for South African golden boy Chad Le Clos it was a huge disappointment based on his own high standards.The 24-year-old Durban-born swimming star knew he needed to bounce back soon to turn his year around. Le Clos has successfully achieved that at the 13 Fina World Championships (25m), which came to an end yesterday in Windsor, Canada.At the tournament, the South African won four medals three golds and a silver rewriting history in more than one way.He won gold in the 50m, 100m, and 200m butterfly and settled for a silver medal in the 200m freestyle.Le Clos didn t only beat his own two year-old record in the 100m butterfly when he touched the wall with a time of 48.08 seconds on Friday but also became the only swimmer to win the 100m butterfly title three times in a row.He won it for the first time in 2012 and successfully defended it two years ago, setting a new world record.His exploits in the swimming pool saw Le Clos also being crowned the best male athlete of this year s tournament.Katinka Hosszu of Hungary went home as the best female of the tourney as she had a great time in the competition finishing with a whopping seven gold medals.SITHEMBISO DINDIsithembisod@thenewage.co.za
