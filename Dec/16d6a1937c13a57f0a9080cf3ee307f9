Gauteng Hawks head Lt-Gen Prince Mokotedi yesterday said he was more convinced that there was a prima facie case on allegations to destabilise law enforcement agencies in the country.This week Mokotedi laid charges against Ipid head Robert McBride, private investigator Paul O Sullivan, former Gauteng Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya and suspended crime intelligence officer Capt Candice Coetzee.The charges include high treason, espionage, conspiracy to commit murder, corruption, intimidation, harassment, defeating the ends of justice and breaking immigration laws. We are not going to back down. We are continuing till we establish the root of these allegations, he said.Mokotedi said it was clear O Sullivan was receiving assistance in gathering information on the targeted individuals. O Sullivan has also cultivated a network of informers in the SAPS and civilian intelligence structures, he said.The late former national police commissioner Jackie Selebi s case has been revived as the Hawks add more charges against O Sullivan for perjury.The Hawks claim O Sullivan lied he was not paid to investigate Selebi and self-confessed drug dealer Glen Agliotti in a covert operation called Bad Guys (Coffee Leg).The New Age can reveal WO Percy Chauke was recently assigned to pursue perjury charges against O Sullivan.This comes as the Hawks investigate the forensic investigator for more than 12 charges including espionage.A source said that during interrogation in April by the Hawks, O Sullivan said that he was not rewarded.O Sullivan claimed R100000 as a reward for assisting in the conviction of a drug syndicate at the time of the then Directorate of Special Operations (Scorpions). An internal memorandum seen by The New Age says O Sullivan incurred over R200000 in expenses. O Sullivan did not give this information for financial gain, with him it is a matter of principal, an internal memorandum said. It is acknowledged that O Sullivan and Selebi were at loggerheads but this information has been handed to the Scorpions. At the time, the head of the special national projects unit, N de Lange, recommended O Sullivan be paid R100000 as reward in lieu of time, effort, money, successful recovery of a large consignment of drugs and the prosecution of the syndicate. O Sullivan is challenging all his charges in court.Hawks spokesperson Brig Hangawni Mulaudzi said they couldn t comment on an ongoing investigation.PETER RAMOTHWALApeterr@thenewage.co.za
