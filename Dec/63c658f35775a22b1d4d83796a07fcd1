Wits University has banned sexual relations between its staff and students to protect students from sexual predator lecturers.This comes just days after the Commission for Gender Equality concluded its hearings into transformation and sexual assault at campuses.Wits vice-chancellor Prof Adam Habib appeared before the commission last week and said the university was working on a policy banning relationships between lecturers and students. The council of the University of the Witwatersrand today approved a policy that regulates sexual and romantic relationships between staff members and undergraduate and honours students.Gender based harm (GBH) is unfortunately a common occurrence in society and across campuses in South Africa, Wits Gender Equality Office director Prof Jackie Dugard said.She said the aim of the policy was to guard against the potential for abuse of power by lecturers. The policy recognises that power dynamics exist between academics and students and seeks to protect students from sexually predatory lecturers, who enter into sexual and/or romantic relationships with students, Dugard said.She said although the relationships were technically consensual (as opposed to non-consensual sexual harassment) in many situations the student felt unable to reject the sexual proposition by lecturers for a range of reasons including being afraid to reject someone with institutional power. This new policy on sexual and romantic relationships between staff and undergraduate and honours students is designed to protect students in this kind of situation by prohibiting sexual/romantic relationships between staff members and undergraduate and honours students, who are least able to navigate university systems and most susceptible to being abused by staff members who enjoy significant powers and autonomy within the university structure, she said.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
