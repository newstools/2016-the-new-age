Some municipalities in the province are under financial distress and were thus at risk of collapse due to irregular grant transfers, it emerged during the Exco media briefing held in Polokwane yesterday.The report on the assessment of six municipalities, Bela-Bela, Lim 368, Mopani, Sekhukhune, Musina and Vhembe revealed that the municipalities were under serious financial pressure, especially in months where there were no grant transfers.The report said some municipalities classified as category A, performed badly in all indicators and were in high risk of financial collapse. Category B municipalities were medium risk because they performed well in other indicators but may still collapse.Low risk municipalities also required close monitoring to ensure that they do not regress. The executive council approved that financial assistance to the amount of R20m be granted to assist the Musina local municipality to service its Eskom debt and other critical financial obligations from the provincial fiscus, provincial government spokesperson Phuti Seloba said.Musina has been identified as a provincial growth point and a special economic zone.The provincial cabinet also resolved that the provincial treasury, cooperative governance, human settlements and traditional affairs departments together with Musina, Vhembe, Sekhukhune, Thabazimbi, Lim 368 and Mopani municipalities should develop financial recovery plans that take into account both financial and non financial matters.Exco also released a report indicating that the overall provincial spending as at October 31 amounted to R32.7bn of the total appropriation of R56.9bn.Compensation of government employees was R23.3bn representing 57 % of the total budget of R40.8bn.MONTSHO MATLALA
