The confidence levels raised after the India tour, a lot of players took a knock after the India tour slowly that belief is coming back,&#8221; Domingo said.&#8220;We still not were we need to be and not were we feel we can be yet, so there is still a lot of improvement that we need to do but we going in the right direction,&#8221; he said.He applauded Vernon Philander after he got himself 12 wickets and 136 runs at the end of the series earning himself a man-of-the-series performance.The Proteas mentor largely credited with the teams resurgence said that Philander is a quality all rounder and that there was a period where he was the number one all rounder in the world.&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt he can get back that mantel if he continues to perform as well as he has in the past few months&#8221; commented DomingoThe man leading says his players always pride themselves on resilience and have done some amazing things.&#8220;We are in a good space at the moment, its a space that s got to be treasured and a space that s got to be nourished all the time. Things can change very quickly in this game and if we not nourishing that particular space and environment,&#8221; he said.Additional reporting ReutersTNA Reporter
