Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela can only silence the hostility and vitriol fired his way by supporters by convincingly winning the club s last three matches by year-end.The spotlight will be on him again as Chiefs host the highly improved Bloemfontein Celtic at the FNB Stadium tonight, a venue at which Chiefs fans threw missiles at the Chiefs coach in protest over recent poor performances.There is no doubt the last three matches before the Christmas recess against Celtic, Polokwane City and Golden Arrows will determine whether he stays on as a coach at least until the new year.Despite all this, Komphela appears to still enjoy support from the club s bosses, who have not commented about the recent poor showings.The challenge starts tonight. Amakhosi have not won in their last seven matches.Victory in the remaining matches may pacify the Boo Boys , at least until February when the Absa Premiership resumes after the Africa Cup of Nations tournament.Chiefs goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo has appealed to supporters not to point fingers at the coach, but should take a swipe at the whole team. The fans must not point fingers at the coach just because things are not going well. Like in every family, hard times do happen, Khuzwayo said. They must try to be supportive. There is no player in this club who goes onto the field without the express will to win. The 26 year old said the players were well aware of the negativity and the importance of turning things around as quickly as possible. Our role is to remain positive and get the results. It is obvious that a big team like Kaizer Chiefs is supposed to perform and produce good results, Khuzwayo said. We are all aware that at the end of the day what is important is to keep intact the team s brand. That is why we always push for positive results. Khuzwayo kept goal when Chiefs lost 3-1 to Chippa United and he expressed huge disappointment with his performance on match day.NEVILLE KHOZAnevillek@thenewage.co.za
