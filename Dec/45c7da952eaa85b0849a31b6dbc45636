Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has continued to question the origins of a story that claimed he had awarded a R30m tender to his girlfriend.He first raised questions about the story at a press briefing last week. He repeated them when addressing Parliament s Police Portfolio Committee yesterday. Members of the committee also probed his relationship with the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, Robert McBride.Nhleko said of the tender allegations: It is a lie and continues to be a lie. What fascinates me largely is why the lie has been told, at what price and for whose benefit? In the annual report this Portfolio Committee dealt with, there s no stating of the R30m and in the AG s work there is no R30m. So where does it come from? Nhleko declined to answer questions about McBride. We wouldn t want to deal with that issue outside of the directives of Parliament. For example, there s this particular process that has got to be started. We feel that any other discussion outside of that designated practice borders on unfair labour practices. Nhleko also told the committee that there was a dangerous snake in the grass that was trying to destabilise the police.When people wanted to undermine democracy, he said, they started with the SAPS. I am not going to be able to identify and characterise the serpent, he said.ANC MP Phindile Mmola said undermining the police s leadership was in the interests of criminal syndicates and those who wanted to harm the trust between the country s citizens and police. There is a very dangerous serpent under the grass that is causing all the havoc, she said. 701198-TNA Reporter
