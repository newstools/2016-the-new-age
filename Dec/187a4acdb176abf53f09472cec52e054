Thabo Senong might be missing some of the Amajita regular players in the Cosafa U-20 Cup but the coach has been impressed by the group of players in his squad as they are excelling in the tournament.The South African U-20 men s national team have had a strong start to the competition at Rustenburg s Moruleng Stadium.South Africa will play their last match of the group stage against Botswana today having already secured a place in the semifinals.In their second match, South Africa defeated Swaziland 1-0 thanks to a late goal from Menzi Ndwandwe, his second of the tournament, on Friday. Swaziland applied a reinforced defence and they relied on counter attacking football. We had to be patient in building our attacks and we also had to counter their counter attacking football, Senong said. I am very happy with the result, the boys worked extremely hard under the extremely hot weather conditions of Rustenburg. Senong has every reason to be happy as his team have not only qualified for the next round but have scored a whopping nine goals in just two matches.Amajita embarrassed Lesotho in an 8-0 drubbing in their opening match, sending a strong message about their intentions to defend the title.Senong is using the tournament to prepare for the next year s U-20 Afcon in Zambia, so it was a bit disappointing for the coach not to get all the players he needed.However, the newcomers have raised their hands and widened the selection pool for Senong going forward.Senong couldn t get the services of Liam Jordan of Portugal s Sporting Lisbon, Zama Ramabuwane who plays for Hapoel Ra anana AFC in Israel and all the players from SuperSport United for the Cosafa tournament.Their clubs didn t release the players because the tournament doesn t fall in the Fifa calendar.Amajita have won their two opening matches in the group stages and they aim to finish the round-robin format at the summit of Group A.SITHEMBISO DINDIsithembisod@thenewage.co.za
