THE South African gospel industry is in mourning following the death of 37-year-old Sama award-winning gospel singer Sfiso Ncwane from kidney failure yesterday.Speaking to The New Age, shocked gospel producer Nqubeko Mbatha described the Kulungile singer as a loving family man and talented gospel singer . People say it is okay for God to take a loved one away but for me it is not, Mbatha said. Death is not a friend but an enemy. When Vuyo Mokoena died, we were all saddened but God soon after gave us Sfiso Ncwane. He was such a talented singer who was not only respected and loved by South Africans but by the continent and the rest of the world because of his unique voice and talent. Tributes poured in on social media yesterday with Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa also paying his respects.President Jacob Zuma also extended his condolences to the Ncwane family The passing of Mr Ncwane is a massive loss for the country, he said. His music touched the hearts of millions of people. He was one of the best gospel artists that the country has ever produced and he left us at such a young age. We are deeply saddened. May his soul rest in peace. After reportedly vomiting blood on Sunday, Ncwane was taken to Fourways Life Hospital, north of Johannesburg, where he died yesterday, family spokesperson and gospel singer Sipho Makhabane said.-SIYABONGA SITHOLE AND NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
