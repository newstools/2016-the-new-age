Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has expressed doubts over whether Manchester United can challenge for the Premier League title but believes they have a realistic chance of finishing in the top four.Sixth-placed United have been held to draws in six of their last eight league games, including consecutive 1-1 results against Arsenal, West Ham United and Everton.Jose Mourinho&#8217;s men are 13 points behind league leaders Chelsea, who are on 34 points, three more than Arsenal and four ahead of Liverpool and Manchester City.&#8220;Of course, 13 points is a long distance, especially when one team is winning games with the quality of Chelsea,&#8221; Guardiola told reporters.&#8220;So it is not easy. But to be in the first four? Of course.&#8221;&#8220;I saw the games against Stoke and Burnley, and other ones at Old Trafford. They deserved by far to win the games but football is like this.&#8220;United have the quality, the history, the manager and the players to be there.&#8221;While no one in Premier League history has gone on to win the league with a 13-point deficit, United did overturn a 12-point gap to Newcastle in 1996.United will hope to break the cycle on Sunday when they host Tottenham Hotspur, who are one place above them in the table.
