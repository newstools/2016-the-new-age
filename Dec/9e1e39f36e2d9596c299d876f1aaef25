Homelessness is increasingly becoming a matter of great concern to many, with at least 400 000 vagrants in South Africa and more than 7000 homeless citizens begging on the streets of Cape Town daily.With few shelters and little understanding from the public, it can be difficult for vagrants to get off the streets once they find themselves in such a dire situation. Recently, there was an uproar from civil society, when DA councillor Shayne Ramsay said that she was planning a march against homeless people and implied that homeless people are criminals.She insisted that homeless people should not be allowed to eat from trash bins on the street. The ANC condemned the comments as irresponsible, while DA leader Mmusi Maimane also condemned the derogatory comments. However, this is the third time that a DA leader has expressed antipathy and disregard towards the homeless. Since 2005, land raids in informal settlements have occurred on a regular basis and the DA-led city of Cape Town s anti-land invasion unit (ALIU) has mercilessly destroyed the homes of the poor often with violence akin to the forced removals of apartheid. When the homes of the poor (often shacks) are violently destroyed by the ALIU, they are often left destitute.In 2014, DA education MEC Debbie Sch fer was quoted (thus confirming her role in the land evictions) when she requested, immediate action by law enforcement and squatter control units to stop further land invasion .Sch fer denied her role in land evictions despite the incident in 2005 as documented by Fatima Schroder, at which Sch fer called a coincidence that she was involved in meetings regarding the unlawful land land raids, despite the moratorium that was legally in place to prevent such evictions. The land evictions, by request of the Western Cape leaders, violate a number of human rights as per the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the UN.The ALIU violates human rights, such as article 1: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood , article 3: Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person and article 5: No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .Article 7: All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination . Article 9: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile . Article 12: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation, everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks . Article 17.2: No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property .Article 25.1: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care. In 2013, at least 125 people were forcefully removed from their homes in Philippi, with the reason quoted by the DA, as the Protection of the Possession of Property Act , yet no such act exists in South African law books.These evictions violate the human rights of the poor and it is clearly unlawful, especially without a court order.In 2007, a homeless man said that after the police confiscated his wife s blanket on a cold winter night, she died. Such Machiavellian tactics are a gross violation of human rights which affects the lives of the poor and should not be tolerated.The third incident where the DA once again showed scant regard for the homeless was in 2014, when a report was published detailing plans to get rid of homeless people in Cape Town. The city s mayoral committee for social development, Suzette Little and safety and security MMC JP Smith, put forward a proposal for a community village programme, also called the street people s reintegration unit was presented as a done deal at the city improvement district meeting on March 15, 2014, which stated that a R40m budget allocation would put an end to all initiatives in the city centre including soup kitchens and street work programmes which would make it hard for the homeless to live on the streets.Jared Sacks said: The unit, with the help of law enforcement will build a dossier against them of minor by-law infractions, such as blocking the pavement and eventually use the community courts to force them into these rehabilitation villages. The source claims that twice during the meeting, Little let slip the word camp and had to correct herself. Sacks further said: These villages are nothing more than glorified prisons similar to the controversial Chinese detox centres, they are essentially presentable versions of Nazi forced-labour camps. With continuous acts of injustice towards the poor by the DA-led city of Cape of Cape Town, we can only hope that they will find a sense of humanity and compassion that will stop dehumanising homeless people as an epidemic that needs to be cleared, but rather as humans such as yourself or myself who found themselves in tough times and who desperately need the support of the government and public.Chelsea Lotz Chelsea Lotz is a writer and commentator
