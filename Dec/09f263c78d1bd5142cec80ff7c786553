Bouncing the bill will have serious ramifications for country, but critics say present form is unconstitutionalFAILURE to promulgate the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment (Fica) bill would have a serious ripple effect on the country, analysts said yesterday.But supporters of President Jacob Zuma s decision not to sign the bill into law and to rather send the bill back to Parliament for review said aspects of the bill would not pass constitutional muster in SA as they infringed on the right to privacy.Supporters of the bill said it would help in the international fight against illicit financial flows and money laundering.Fica was an important mechanism in strengthening South Africa s financial systems and would also help when the international Financial Action Task Force reviews the country s money laundering and financial terrorism instruments in 2019.The bill puts the onus on financial institutions to perform due diligence on politically exposed people . This and other aspects of the bill have raised concerns that it is unconstitutional.University of Witwatersrand senior lecturer in banking law Dr Herbert Kawadza yesterday said it was sad that based on flimsy reasons the president has decided to refer the bill back to Parliament . This is a crucial bill that aims to ensure the safety and soundness of the South African financial sector. It will bring SA in line with international standards such as the Financial Action Task Force s recommendations on politically exposed persons, or simply people who have been entrusted with prominent public functions, Kawadza said. Likewise, it would align our banking regime with article 52 of the UN convention against corruption. Article 52 refers to the prevention and detection of transfers of the proceeds of crime and requires financial institutions to take reasonable steps to determine the identity of beneficial owners of funds deposited into high-value accounts and to conduct enhanced scrutiny of accounts sought or maintained by or on behalf of individuals who are, or have been, entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates .Another group that supports the bill in its present form, the Council for the Advancement of the Constitution in South Africa (Casac), said 187 countries had passed similar legislation to the Fica Bill.Casac executive secretary Lawson Naidoo said it was of concern that the president was not signing into law legislation which was important to combat international financial crimes.Transform RSA, a pressure group that opposes the proposed law, said the bill gave powers to the Financial Task Team to take any action against anyone in SA without following procedure and overstepping local judiciary and prosecutorial structures .TransformRSA chairperson Adil Nchabeleng said the provisions in the bill dealing with prominent persons infringed on the rights of citizens as spelled out in the Constitution and the risk management and compliance programme as defined, violated the constitutional right to due process and allowing people to defend themselves .-SAMUEL MUNGADZE
