Most refugees from Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique, get documented here and you get economic migrants. They mean no harm, Gigaba added.He further said that most of the migrants contributed to the countries economy by paying taxes and making the country to be more diverse.On the question of whether he will apologise on the utterances he made, Mashaba told a journalist who attended that he didn t see the need for him to apologise because people must respect the rule of law all the time.-Sipho Jack
