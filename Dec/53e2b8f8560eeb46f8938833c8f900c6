Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has denounced a media report claiming that she threatened to withdraw South Africa s hosting of the African Ombudsman and Mediators Association general assembly if her predecessor, Thuli Madonsela, was invited to the event.This comes after weekend media reports that said Mkhwebane disliked the former public protector so much so that she did not want her at the event, which was held last month.Mkhwebane called the reports baseless and malicious .Nonetheless, Madonsela was not invited to the general assembly, even though she was honoured for her service in office.Her trophy and certificate were accepted on her behalf by deputy public protector Kevin Malunga.Other reports surfaced at the weekend that Mkhwebane had fired her predecessor s chief of staff, Bonginkosi Dhlamini. According to City Press, Dhlamini and three others who worked in Madonsela s private office were key players in the so-called state of capture report. The paper reported that all those involved had been moved to other departments.Mkhwebane, however, said it was common practice for a new head of an institution to appoint own staff to run an office. The private office is similar to a ministry in government circles, a statement from Mkhwebane s office said. Even (Thuli Madonsela) brought her own team of aides when she took office and, at that point, staff that previously worked with advocate Lawrence Mushwana were redeployed elsewhere. &#8211;TNA REPORTER
