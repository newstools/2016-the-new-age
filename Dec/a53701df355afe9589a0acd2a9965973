High unemployment in Lephalale which is home to two Eskom power stations Medupi and Matimba and an open pit coal mine has brought the town s mayor and jobless people on a collision course.The situation has also sparked marches and riots, resulting in allegations of police brutality.Local residents say the unemployment rate was very high and appealed to the authorities to address their problem and be given first preference for employment at the power stations, that often attract even people from other areas.Some unemployed people who tried to stage a march on Tuesday last week, accused Lephalale mayor Jack Maeko of controlling employment processes, were dispersed by police who fired rubber bullets at them.Residents accused police of using brutal force to disperse them.However, the municipality s spokesperson, Conscious Chiloane, rejected claims that the mayor was interfering and wielded influence in the employment process at the two power stations. Even here within the municipality, the mayor, all councillors and any other politicians are not involved in hiring people. We have capacitated HR teams which give out job advertisements and handle all the necessary steps including interviews. The mayor is far from those things, Chiloane said. Private companies have their own processes and in most cases appoint their own community liaison officers to deal with employment issues. The mayor has nothing to do with employment in the companies. Responding on police brutality, police spokesperson Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said: Firstly their march was illegal and they converged at a shopping complex. They refused to disperse and we used rubber bullets to disperse them because we wanted to clear the area within a short space of time. However, police said they received no reports of injuries and dismissed accusations that police used brutal force to disperse the marchers. Police will remain in Lephalale to monitor but the situation is calm now, the police spokesperson said.On Wednesday last week provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba landed in the area in a helicopter to command officers on the ground, although the place was peaceful.montshom@thenewage.co.za
