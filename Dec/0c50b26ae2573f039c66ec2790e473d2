AFTER years of obscurity, Raymond Monama has finally rediscovered the form that made him one of the finest attacking players in the country. The Seshego-born Monama is enjoying his football again at Royal Eagles in his second spell after being in the doldrums at Mamelodi Sundowns four seasons ago.The rich boys from Pretoria had lured him away from Black Leopards where he showed great potential. But as has been the case with many promising players, Monama s career stalled Downs. He was subsequently loaned out to University of Pretoria and Polokwane City. In his first season at Eagles, the 27-yearold attacking midfielder didn t settle well.But now in his second season, Monama has become one of the key players and has been instrumental in putting Eagles in good contention for National First Division glory. He was at his best against AmaZulu, netting a first half brace, although his side went down 3-2 in a fiercely contested KZN derby in KwaMashu at the weekend. Those goals took his tally to 10 this season, two goals behind teammate Sedwyn George and joint-leading scorer Mhlengi Cele of Thanda Royal Zulu. What has been the secret behind Monama s scoring exploits and fine form so far? The coach (Kostadin Papic) wants us to play attacking football and that suited my style. And also my teammates have been supportive. Providing me with assists. I can safely say I feel born again, Monama said. I want to help Eagles gain promotion because so far we have done well to be where we are. news@thenewage.co.za
