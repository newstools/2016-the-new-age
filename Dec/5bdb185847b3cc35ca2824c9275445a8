More than 1000 young people from across the country have gathered in the province for the youth camp which starts today at 3 South African Infantry Battalion near Kimberley. The camp will run until December 12.Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini is expected to address the week-long camp that is aimed at addressing young people s concerns including child-headed households, access to education and alcohol and substance abuse.Departmental spokesperson Lumka Oliphant said discussions would be held with the view to shape young people into empowered community leaders who will go back to their respective communities and implement development plans. The youth camp will provide an opportunity for the young people, who are now leaders in their own right in their communities, to share their experiences, Oliphant said.Oliphant said since the inception of the youth camp in 2012, young people had undertaken a number of projects in their communities aimed at development.Other factors to be discussed include sky-rocketing unemployment among young people, sexual abuse, youth pregnancy, social and cultural integration and HIV-Aids. The youth camp will see young people coming together to share ideas and solutions with the aim of promoting national identity, nation building, social cohesion, patriotism and active citizenry among young people in the country, Oliphant said.Deputy Minister in the Presidency Buti Manamela urged the youth to organise themselves and move from self-entitlement while speaking last week ahead of the camp.Dlamini is expected to be joined by officials from the Department of Defence, Military Veterans and provincial leaders in motivating the youth.Recently, Dlamini said the young people must come up with innovative ideas on how to turn the province around and fight social ills. Young people must come up with ideas on how we are going to save water as a society and create a conducive environment for everyone to live in, she said.TIISETSO MANOKO
