Superstar Athlete Caster Semenya says that courage and a strong character as well as a positive attitude helps her face her challenges. Challenges make you want to do more.. they (challenges) do motivate, for me if I get stumbling blocks I always find a way to overcome them. Obviously with the support that you get fromyour people and people you represent Said the Olympic champion.Semenya has been at the centre of a raging controversy in recent years because of her naturally occurring condition, hyperandrogenism, which causes elevated testosterone levels.Rival runners have said they want authorities to revisit rules that limit the amount of testosterone allowed in competitors. The 25 year old was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling last year judged the International Association of Athletics Federations restrictions illegal, freeing Semenya to compete in her natural state.Semenya ultimately cruised to victory in the women s 800m claiming her first Olympic gold, at the Rio Olympics earlier this year. She crossed the line more than 1.20sec clear of the field in 1min 55.28sec at the Olympic Stadium.The gold medal winner has more ambitions for the new athletics season and beating her Olympic time she said that: Records are meant to be broken and we&#8217;ll break them ..the important thing is to be under 1:55:00 in the 800m Now we just have to go and enjoy the accolades, start off with the basics as we always do I&#8217;m still off season, I ve even gained a little bit of weight Semenya said.She also mentioned that it will be a long build up toward the World Champs and that the domestic season will offer an opportunity to try and pick up speed and have a good season again.Additional reporting AFP&nbsp;TNA Reporter
