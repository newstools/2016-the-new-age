France called on the Democratic Republic of Congo government to &#8220;respect human rights&#8221; after clashes erupted as the president&#8217;s mandate ended with no sign he was preparing to leave.&#8220;France calls on the Congolese authorities and security forces to respect human rights,&#8221; said a spokesman for France&#8217;s foreign ministry, adding that those responsible for human rights violations would he held accountable.Gunfire was heard in DR Congo&#8217;s two largest cities overnight and tensions remain high.Tension had been mounting for months as the December deadline approached for the end of President Joseph Kabila&#8217;s second and constitutionally final term in office.As the deadline approached the constitutional court this year ruled he could stay in office until elections were held.But no polls have been organised and the authorities instead did a deal in October with fringe opposition parties that effectively allows him to hold on to power till early 2018.In a last-ditch bid to achieve a peaceful transfer of power, the Catholic church launched talks last week including all of the country&#8217;s parties. The talks were halted Saturday with no significant progress made but were to resume on Wednesday.Anti-Kabila protests in September claimed 53 lives, according to the UN.-AFP
