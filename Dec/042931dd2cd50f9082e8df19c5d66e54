Sri Lanka lost captain Angelo Matthews as two more wickets fell in the second session on the second day of the first test against South Africa to leave the tourists struggling on 104 for five at tea on Tuesday.They trailed by 182 runs with five wickets remaining after dismissing South Africa earlier for 286, with Dinesh Chandimal not out on 21 and Dhananjayade Silva on six.A top order collapse at St George&#8217;s Park had Sri Lanka teetering at 37 for three at lunch but Matthews offered hope of a revival with some stout resistance in the second session before edging Kagiso Rabada&#8217;s full delivery to slip where Dean Elgar caught him for 39 .Opener Kaushal Silva, who had seen three wickets go down before him, was the other batsman dismissed after lunch, trapped leg before wicket by Vernon Philander for 16.Earlier, Suranga Lakmal claimed career-best figures to help dismiss South Africa, completing his first test match five-wicket haul and finishing with 5-63 as the home side added just 19 runs to their overnight total.South Africa then made quick inroads through pace duo of Kyle Abbott and Philander to wrestle back control of the contest.Dimuth Karunaratne was the first Sri Lankan dismissed, getting an inside edge to Abbott and playing onto his stumps to depart for five.Kusal Perera went next for seven, caught behind by Quinton de Kock off Philander, and Kusal Mendis followed soon after without scoring as the wicketkeeper took another diving catch, this time off Abbott&#8217;s bowling.South Africa had been hoping de Kock and Philander would add significant runs to their overnight total of 267-6 but Philander went for 13 in the fifth over of the day, caught at deep square leg after being tempted into a hook by a short ball from Nuwan Pradeep.He was quickly followed back to the pavilion by Keshav Maharaj and Abbott, who both faced only three balls and failed to score. Maharaj was caught behind by wicketkeeper Chandimal off Lakmal while Abbott was run out.De Kock was the last South African wicket to fall, out for 37 as he was superbly yorked by Pradeep.-Reuters
