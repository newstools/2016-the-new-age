&nbsp;Challenger Nana Akufo-Addo won Ghana&#8217;s national election on Friday, tapping into an electorate fed up with a sputtering economy and ready for change.The erudite 72-year-old human rights lawyer cruised to victory winning 53.8 percent of the votes, according to the country&#8217;s election agency.&#8220;I will not let you down. I will do all in my power to live up to your hopes and expectations,&#8221; Akufo-Addo said to an ecstatic crowd at his house in the country&#8217;s capital of Accra.&#8220;I will do my best to serve your interests and put our country back on the path of progress and prosperity.&#8221;Incumbent John Mahama conceded defeat in the evening two days after a hotly contested race that was seen as a test of the country&#8217;s democracy in a region plagued by dictators and coups.Mahama called to congratulate opposition leader Akufo-Addo, whose New Patriotic Party (NPP) supporters had been gathering for hours outside his house after local media gave him a clear lead following the Wednesday vote.&#8220;Yes he has conceded defeat,&#8221; George Lawson of Mahama&#8217;s New Democratic Congress (NDC) party told AFP.Akufo-Addo had campaigned on a platform promising to boost growth and deliver jobs.&#8220;The president of Ghana is president for every single Ghanaian,&#8221; Akufo-Addo said, as fireworks popped overhead and thousands of people cheered in the streets outside his house.&#8211; &#8216;Gold standard&#8217; &#8211;Akufo-Addo&#8217;s supporters almost all in head-to-toe white, a symbol of victory had been dancing on his lawn for hours in anticipation of his victory speech.At one point, they broke out in an enthusiastic a cappella rendition of Ghana&#8217;s national anthem.&#8220;We have won,&#8221; said Hajia Mustafa, a 44-year-old trader, flashing a wide smile, &#8220;I have my president, I have my choice.&#8221;The high-stakes race between Akufo-Addo and Mahama has been seen as a litmus test of the stability for one of Africa&#8217;s most secure democracies.But fears of widespread violence erupting during the election never materialised, with a generally peaceful voting day followed by calm as the official results trickled in.&#8220;I think Ghanaians should be extraordinarily proud of themselves,&#8221; said Ambassador Johnnie Carson of the National Democratic Institute, an election observer.&#8220;Ghana has distinguished itself in the last two and a half decades with integrity and transparency,&#8221; Carson said.&#8220;It is a gold standard for democracy in Africa.&#8221;&#8211; &#8216;Escaped violence&#8217; &#8211;Yet while the European Union Election Observation Mission said that Ghana &#8220;largely escaped the violence many had feared&#8221; it pointed to other areas of concern.&#8220;The misuse of incumbency, including unequal access to state media, and unaccountable campaign financing were areas Ghana could address in the future,&#8221; said the mission in a statement.Akufo-Addo will serve a four-year term in the former British colony, a once booming country that has seen its economy slow, currency deteriorate and inflation soar.Mahama, who came to power in 2012 after beating Akufo-Addo, had urged voters to &#8220;stay the course&#8221;, promising to deliver more infrastructure projects.In his third bid for the top job, Akufo-Addo blasted Ghana&#8217;s poor economic growth rate &#8212; estimated at 3.3 percent in 2016, the lowest rate for two decades &#8212; and laid out a radical vision to transform the country&#8217;s economy.Akufo-Addo had also warned his supporters that &#8220;vigilance is key&#8221; at the polls in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the 2012 vote &#8212; narrowly won by Mahama with 50.7 percent &#8212; that he contested unsuccessfully in the country&#8217;s Supreme Court.Ghana is the world&#8217;s second biggest producer of cocoa after Ivory Coast and Africa&#8217;s second biggest gold producer after South Africa.But it was forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2015 for a bailout as global commodity prices tanked.&nbsp;AFP
