The oldest surviving building in South Africa, the Castle of Good Hope, will this week be commemorating 350 years of existence with President Jacob Zuma paying tribute at a closing event on Friday.The castle was built between 1666 and 1679 by the Dutch East India Company (VOC). At the time, it was located close to the beach of what is today Table Bay and provided shelter for all Europeans who settled at the Cape. The fortress was later the centre of civilian, political and military life in the Cape.The quadrangular fort was built after the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck in 1652, close to where the Grand Parade is situated today. It was planned from a central point with five bastions, named after the main titles of Willem, the Prince of Orange.The Western bastion was named Leerdam, followed in clockwise order by Buuren, Catzenellenbogen, Nassau and Oranje. However, the walls of the fort, which were constructed mainly of clay, collapsed and required constant repairs.In 1664, there were renewed rumours of war between Britain and the Netherlands and they feared a British attack on the Cape. Zacharias Wagenaer was instructed to build a five-pointed stone castle.The Castle is reportedly not the first fort to be built at the Cape but the only surviving one. Today, the Castle of Good Hope is the seat of the military in the Cape and hosts three museums, including Castle Military Museum, Iziko Hope Gallery with changing exhibitions at Secunde s House and William Fehr Collection, in which rooms are historically decorated with furniture, paintings and accessories of the 17th to 19th centuries.This week, the ministry of defence and military veterans will be commemorating the historical building s milestone. The events are to see various key role players and members of royal houses of the country in attendance among many others.Spokesperson for the department of defence and military, Sonwabe Mbangana, said: The tribute, which will be officiated by President Jacob Zuma, will honour their majesties, king Langalibalele, king Cetshwayo, king Sekhukhune and Khoisan freedom fighter Doman. These kings were all incarcerated at the Castle of Good Hope after having led various wars of resistance against the land and cattle dispossessions that ensued following the arrival of Dutch and later British settlers in South Africa. The castle, declared a national monument in 1936, today houses the military personnel of the SA army in the Western Cape, the famous William Fehr Collection of historic artworks, the Castle Military Museum and ceremonial facilities for traditional Cape Regiments.This gateway that was built in 1682 replaced the old entrance which faced the sea. The bell tower, situated above the main entrance, was built in 1684.The original bell, which is the oldest in South Africa, was cast in Amsterdam in 1697 by Claude Fremy and weighs 303kg.It was used to toll the hours and warn citizens of danger and could be heard 10km away. It was also rung to call residents and soldiers to the castle for important announcements.Inside the walls of the castle is a church, bakery, living quarters, offices, cells and numerous other facilities.The yellow paint on the walls was chosen to reduce the glare from the sunlight and also because it reflected the heat.The inner courtyard is divided by a wall, initially intended to provide protection to the inhabitants in the event of an attack. The well-known Kat Balcony is an outstanding feature of the dividing wall.The original balcony was built in 1695, then was rebuilt in its present form by the VOC between 1786 and 1790.From this balcony, proclamations and announcements were made to the soldiers, slaves and civilians at the Cape. All judicial sentences were read here and official visitors welcomed to the Castle.The balcony leads to the famous William Fehr Collection of historical paintings and period furniture which have a special relevance to the Cape.Another feature of the oldest building is the original Dolphin Pool that was named after the impressive fountain in the form of a dolphin in the middle of the pool.It was possible to make a replica of the fountain by examining sketches and descriptions made by Lady Anne Barnard during the late 1790s.The fountain has been reconstructed from the remains of the clay floor and walls exposed in 1982.The dolphin resembles an animal that is found in the Mediterranean.In the past, the dolphin or a mythical sea monster was a popular maritime symbol, often used in maps and other objects.Thousands from across the world have visited the historical venue over the years,The castle opens daily from 9am to 4pm from Monday to Saturday, except on Christmas Day and New Year s Day.Daily tours are conducted at 11am, noon and 2pm.The changing of the guard is held Monday to Friday at noon.Visitors are also often impressed by the phenomenal 360 view over Table Mountain, Devil s Peak, Lion s Head, the towers of the city centre and the other districts in the east.NADINE FORD-KRITZINGERnadinef@thenewage.co.za
