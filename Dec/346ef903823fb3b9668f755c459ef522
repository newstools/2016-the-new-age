Leaders Cape Town City snatched a stoppage-time equaliser to draw 1-1 at home against second-place SuperSport United Friday and retain a three-point South African Premiership advantage. United goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse failed to clear a lob into the goalmouth and leading City scorer Lebogang Manyama pushed the loose ball into the net for his eighth league goal this season.SuperSport, seeking revenge for a 2-1 defeat by Cape Town last Saturday in the South African League Cup final, had gone ahead eight minutes from time in the top-of-the-table showdown.A counterattack left City outnumbered and Reneilwe Letsholonyane passed across the goal for Zimbabwean Kingston Nkhatha to fire past Shu-Aib Walters.Cape Town have 25 points from 14 matches and SuperSport 22 from 13 in the richest African national football league with a 10 million rand ($710,000, 680,000 euros) first prize.City hope to win the Premiership at the first attempt having been formed only last June after buying the franchise of Mpumalanga Black Aces.&#8220;We deserved more than we got,&#8221; said Cape Town coach and former South Africa midfielder Eric Tinkler.&#8220;The boys were brilliant at times, but once again over-elaboration cost us scoring chances. We must learn to keep it simple when passing.&#8221; England-born SuperSport coach Stuart Baxter offered a different view of a lively game.&#8220;I thought we were very unlucky not to win &#8212; we &#8216;killed&#8217; Cape Town during the second half. Conceding so late was particularly disappointing as a win would have taken us to the top.&#8221;-AFP
