BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt has become the latest Absa Premiership coach to blast his players in public. Hunt expressed disgust at Gabadinho Mhango s attitude, particularly his demeanour.Mhango has been one of the best performers for Wits this season, but Hunt is certainly not pleased with his attitude. The Malawian international missed a sitter during the 1-1 draw against 10-man Maritzburg United on Tuesday and was summarily replaced with Cuthbert Malajila, who scored the equaliser. Poor attitude by him. It is as simple as that. That was the miss of the year, an incensed Hunt said of Mhango s miss. If you want to work for the team and some people are not working hard enough, it s a problem. Besides missing the goal, it s his demeanour. Despite dropping two points, Wits surged on top of the log on goal difference with 25 points from 13 games ahead of Cape Town City, with 14 games. Games in hand mean nothing. I d rather have points. The last five games we really haven t gotten the results and a game like today we were well worth the three points here, Hunt said. There was no danger here. I mean they were never going to score from open play. There again we tossed itaway, so I have to rethink and start again. You know we got one or two coming in, one or two going out, so we are going to freshen up the place a bit. But certainly we lack a little bit in the final third. A few players we have lack a little bit of game-time here and there. Hunt believes the return of English striker James Keene from injury will add firepower in the new year. Hopefully we will get James Keene back. He will make a huge difference up front. Phakamani Mahlambi is just coming back now and one or two others will come in as well. It should help strengthen our team. We need one or two others in other areas. news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
