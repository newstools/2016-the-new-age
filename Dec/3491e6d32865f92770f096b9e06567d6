Colombia international James Rodriguez said he had received offers to leave European champions Real Madrid and was considering his future in order to play more often.Rodriguez&#8217;s importance to Real has faded in the last two seasons, after an impressive first campaign, since his 80-million-euro ($83.53-million) move from Monaco in 2014, immediately after earning the Golden Boot at the World Cup.&#8220;I can&#8217;t guarantee if I&#8217;m going to stay here. I&#8217;ve had offers and I have seven days to think about it. I&#8217;m happy at Real Madrid but I want to play more,&#8221; Rodriguez told reporters on Sunday.Rodriguez has made just four league starts this season and played no part in Real&#8217;s 4-2 win over Kashima Antlers in the Club World Cup final on Sunday, surprising reporters by coming out to speak to the media in Yokohama.&#8220;I feel a bit bitter about not playing in the final but I&#8217;m happy we won the trophy. Ideally I&#8217;d stay at Real Madrid forever but things don&#8217;t always turn out as you want. I have to consider everything and maybe look for a way out.&#8221;-Reuters
