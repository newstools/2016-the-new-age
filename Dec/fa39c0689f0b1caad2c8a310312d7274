BIGOTS, true to form, always act in strange and irrational ways. Their hearts are full of prejudice and hatred, as is in the case of racial stereotyping.Today, as was yesterday, homophobia ironically finds home and resonance in the hearts of communities that profess to be offended by racism, that claim to hate racists like poison, yet continue to use their homophobic battering rams to unjustly persecute lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities.In the past few years the phenomenon of this prejudice has been increasing in its intensity. Last week, a Noluvo Swelindawo, of Driftsands near Khayelitsha in the Western Cape, was murdered, ostensibly because she was a lesbian. And the pattern of harassment and murder and persecutions is on the increase.As this senseless killing happens, a same-sex couple, Nokuthula and Nonkululeko Mbatha of Durban, is said to be on the run and in hiding after they were chased away from their residence by members of their own community who frown upon same-sex relationships.The statistics tell the story in a more troubling and graphic way: More than 55% of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in South Africans fear they will experience discrimination due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. This piece of information released in a report by Love and Hate Campaign is disturbing, as it is also illuminating. In light of this information, what is to be done?More disturbing is that the church, the largest non-government organisation in the country, is not, by any stretch of the imagination, coming out in any visible way to be seen to be on the side of those who are oppressed.Instead, in some of its synods, the church has overtly given an indication that homosexuality is not welcome in the house of God, because the Bible says so .The leadership of the church in most instances frequently rely on uncertain and obscure biblical texts to justify homophobia. If this is true, it would mean that statistically, the church which boasts great numbers of adherents running into tens of millions of followers, could be susceptible and prone to being homophobic.Additionally, the leaders of the so-called mainstream churches may not be willing to move away from the unhelpful dogma because they fear a backlash from their own followers who may, because of tradition and upbringing, are stereotypical about this so-called Western-orientated practice .If the words of the church, that homosexuality is an abomination (Leviticus 18.22), are accepted without proper distillation and contextualisation, then the church hierarchy and its followers could be drinking from a poisoned chalice and surely in time may see droves of lesbian and gay people walking away from the church.But this is not the central argument of this article. The focus is on what informs this homophobia. The central thrust of my enquiry is, what ought to be done to deal with the homophobic tendencies? What can we do to unshackle communities of the chains of prejudice and homophobia?When we display tendencies of homophobia are we not breaching the country s constitutional prescription of the Bill of Rights that states: Everyone is equal before the law and has a right to equal protection and benefit of the law. And Chapter 2 of the Bill of Rightscontinues: The state may not unfairly discriminate directly and indirectly againstanyone on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience,belief, culture, language and birth. When it comes to racism, why are we making some progress and appear to have reached some consensus that as a constitutionally-based democracy racism is unacceptable and that millions of people, with a few exceptions, are in agreement of the need to abandon that path that could so easily lead to racial conflagration.And so what does it mean to become a moral community? The church and society are supposed to be an embodiment of that moral community.For decades part of the apartheid church under the rubric of apartheid, propagated the poisonous propaganda that black was inferior and white superior, and that it could use the Bible to bolster and perpetuate that ideology or dogma of death.Now we know, as a matter of historical fact that nearly 20 years ago, the Dutch Reformed Church abandoned that path, revoked that position and asked for forgiveness for having been blinded by racial prejudice and showed contrition for the suffering and pain that apartheid brought to blacks. Not only did the Dutch Reformed Church show contrition; it also declared apartheid a heresy.Is the broader church willing to recant its unhelpful dogma of homophobia and rightfully declare it as a heresy as the Dutch Reformed Church did with racism and apartheid?The last point to be made is that reason must always give effect to ethical living. If we accept that racism is an aberration, what makes us so doggedly opposed to seeing homophobia as an offence against morality because it is an offence against reason?If we want to promote the interests of all, we need to abandon dogmas that divide society and bring death.Noluvo Swelindayo, the young lesbian, and many of her comrades did not deserve persecution and death. The homage we can pay to her community to prepare her burial is to revoke o ur homophobic tendencies.-JO-MANGALISO MDHLELA
