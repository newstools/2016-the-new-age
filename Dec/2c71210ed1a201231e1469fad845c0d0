The Dutch economy has grown by 2.1 percent this year the government&#8217;s economic think tank said on Tuesday, thereby recovering to pre-financial crisis levels.&#8220;With one quarter to go, 2016 has been a special year for economic recovery,&#8221; The Hague-based Central Planning Office (CPB) said in a statement.&#8221;Production per capita is back to 2008 levels following double dips in 2009 and 2012-13,&#8221; the CPB said, adding that the last time Europe&#8217;s sixth-largest economy showed such growth after a sustained crisis period was back in the 1980s.Unemployment also fell, from 6.9 percent to 6.0 percent, in 2016 with a further dip to 5.3 percent predicted for next year &#8212; but remains well above the 4.0 percent unemployment figure of 2008.The CPB said improved growth was mainly due to a rise in consumer spending, with a thaw in the housing market &#8212; which has seen a price freeze for several years &#8212; having also stimulated spending.It warned however that many uncertainties possibly affecting economic growth remained for next year, including fears over Britain&#8217;s plans to leave the EU and US economic policy under a Trump administration.The Dutch economy took a serious blow in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis and has seen several years of austerity-driven budgets by Prime Minister Mark Rutte&#8217;s Liberal-Labour coalition government.But Rutte has recently been driving home the point that the economy is improving &#8212; an important rallying point for the Dutch premier ahead of planned parliamentary polls in March next year.-AFP
