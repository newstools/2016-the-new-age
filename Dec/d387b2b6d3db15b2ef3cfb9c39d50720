England knocked the Blitzbokke off their perch when they defeated the Cape Town Sevens defending champs 19-17 in a pulsating final at Cape Town Stadium yesterday.The Poms had their work cut out and scintillating defence saw them stifle the much feared Blitzbokke backline. The absence of speedster Seabelo Senatla was evident in the Blitzbokke attack.England led 12-5 at half time after a converted try from Richard de Carpentier and a five pointer from winger Dan Norton cancelled a Chris Dry try. A moment of sheer brilliance and well executed grubber kick by elusive Rosko Specman earned a try under the post to level matters 12-12 early in the second half.But it was the Poms who delivered the telling blow when Ruaridh McConnochie dived over after England s relentless attacks and had the Boks pinned inside their 22m. With seconds remaining on the clock Werner Kok dived over in the left hand corner to make it 17-19.The HSBC Cape Town Sevens series was a huge success on and off the field of play and economically a massive boost for the province s coffers. A total of 108941 supporters flocked through the gates of the Cape Town Stadium for a highly successful second instalment of the Cape Town Sevens.A total of 54995 fans were in the stands to watch the Blitzbokke edge out rivals New Zealand 14-7 in a pulsating semifinal. Earlier in the day the Blitzbokke scored an emphatic 33-0 victory over Wales in the quarterfinal.SA Rugby CEO Jurie Roux said: We are happy with the second Cape Town Sevens and first and foremost we have to thank all the supporters who came out to support. But there were many other role players too and all of them deserved a massive thanks. We re proud of the Cape Town Sevens and I think we ve made some great strides this year compared to 2015. We re constantly evolving and have already picked up on things we can do even better. VINCENT CRUYWAGENvincentc@thenewage.co.za
