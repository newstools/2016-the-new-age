The Western Cape department of education was shocked by the video in which a female school pupil is seen viciously attacking another pupil and slamming her head against her knees at a Stellenbosch high school.The Winelands district director visited Luckhoff Secondary School yesterday after watching the video clip.At least two bystanders can be seen in the video but neither of them attempt to help the victim.The education department said it had launched an investigation into the incident that apparently happened inside a classroom last week in full view of other pupils.The culprit has since been removed by her parents from the school. We are shocked by the violent nature of the video involving pupils. A disciplinary hearing has been scheduled for December 8, spokesperson for the provincial MEC, Jessica Shelver, said. The parents of the perpetrator have informed us that they have voluntarily removed their daughter from the school. The school will, however, still conduct a disciplinary hearing. The victim is receiving counselling and support. The MEC has requested that the school run anti-bullying interventions at the school at the start of the 2017 academic year. Life Talk Forum, a non-governmental organisation, managing director Izabella Gates said that bullying had become more and more prevalent. In terms of physical bullying there could be anger, insecurity or other issues going on in the person doing the bullying. It might be from home, school or other unresolved issues, Gates said.Shelver said respect for human dignity was one of the values enshrined in the country s Constitution and bullying was a denial of this.This is why the department views bullying in a very serious light.Tatenda Chiriseri
