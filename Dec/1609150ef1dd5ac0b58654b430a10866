Finding prolific strikers has been the biggest challenge for junior national teams, but Amajita duo Luther Singh and Menzi Ndwandwe give SA hope.The two strikers were among the players that have helped the SA U-20 national team excel at the Cosafa Cup that kicked off last week in Rustenburg.The pair helped Amajita to wallop Angola 5-0 in the semifinal on Wednesday, with Singh scoring a hat-trick and Ndwandwe bagging a brace.SA has scored a whopping 15 goals in just four matches on the road to the final, a feat that has left coach Thabo Senong a happy man.Singh is the leading goal-scorer in the tournament with Ndwandwe hot on his heels with four goals together with Fashion Sakala of Zambia and Sudan s Walaa MohamedSenong believes the duo are just what SA has been looking for. It s good that we now have players that can finish off chances we create because that has been a constant problem, Senong said. Singh has just joined the team but he is gelling well and we are glad to have him Menzi has been with us since April and keeps improving. Singh, who has been compared to Bafana Bafana great Benni McCarthy, plies his trade in Sweden for GAIS while Ndwandwe is with NFD side AmaZulu.SITHEMBISO DINDI|sithembisod@thenewage.co.za
