President-elect Donald Trump called Tuesday for the cancellation of a multi-billion dollar Boeing contract to build the next Air Force One, calling the ballooning costs &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221;&#8220;Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!&#8221; Trump tweeted.Converting a pair of 747-8 jumbo jets to state-of-the-art luxury command centers by 2024 had been estimated to cost $3 billion when Boeing was picked for the job in January 2015.The legendary light blue and white liveried jets &#8212; &#8220;The United States of America&#8221; emblazoned on the fuselage and an American flag on the tail &#8212; are a powerful symbol of US might.But the current double-decker 747-200s, first ordered by Ronald Reagan and put into service in 1990, are getting old.Earlier this year, the Air Force issued the first of a series of contracts for the project to build new ones.Ironically, it was a $25.7 million effort to look at ways to cut the costs of fielding the next presidential aircraft.Instead, cost projections have apparently ballooned, prompting Trump&#8217;s outburst.&#8220;I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,&#8221; the president-elect told reporters at Trump Tower, his Manhattan headquarters.He said the estimated $4 billion cost was &#8220;totally out of control&#8221; and &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221;Boeing had no immediate comment.Prestige items like Air Force One have been targeted before because of spiralling costs.In 2009, President Barack Obama halted a project to replace the Marine One helicopters that ferry the president.Costs had soared to nearly $11.5 billion after the 28 helicopters were ordered in 2005.-AFP
