THANDA Royal Zulu coach Roger Sikhakhane s contract has not been finalised, reportedly because the club chairperson is always overseas attending to his other business interests. The New Age has gathered that chairperson Pierre Delvaux s busy schedule has led to Sikhakhane not being given a proper contract by the club he has elevated to the top of the National First Division standings and are yet to lose in 13 matches.In fact, Sikhakhane was not part of the team which visited Stellenbosch FC in their Nedbank Cup preliminary fixture at Coetzenberg Stadium yesterday. Efforts to get hold of Delvaux drew a blank. Sikhakhane s agent Abbie Rasimphi of Liberate Resources Sports Management has threatened that should the situation continue until the December break, they will entertain offers from potential suitors. Roger has been working without a contract at Thanda Royal Zulu. We have engaged with the club on several occasions and are yet to receive a response. With the current situation it means that the coach can walk away at any time, Rasimphi said. What I like is that Roger is giving his all to the team that is not giving him the contract. It s a pity that he is giving his all to a team that is not giving him anything in return. What we have done is what people say is to comply and complain after. I m sure they wanted to see what he can do. But now they see what he can do. I don t know what the stumbling block is regarding the contract. Rasimphi said there are teams in the NFD and PSL who have approached him for Sikhakhane s services. We will weigh our options and take it from there. Sikhakhane joined Amabhubesi towards the end of last campaign. He arrived from Chippa United with whom he had an on and off relationship with owner Siviwe Chippa Mpengesi. Should Sikhakhane leave Thanda, it would be a blow for the former PSL campaigners, who have battled to gain promotion back to the PSL since they dropped down in 2007.news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
