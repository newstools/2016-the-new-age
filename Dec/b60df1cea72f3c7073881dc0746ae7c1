Today marks day three of the critical milestone of the disposal of none-core state properties embedded in the mandate of the Gauteng department of infrastructure development (GDID).This includes the auctioning of the official residence of the premier with a starting price of R9m which is a lot less than taxpayers have spent on it.The provincial government bought the property in Bryanston for R11.4m from a French businessman in 2004.An additional R4m was spent on renovations and structural defects .Premier David Makhura has not used the property since taking office in May 2014. It was renovated and occupied by former premier Nomvula Mokonyane.The house is being auctioned online by Tirhani Auctioneers. The province is also auctioning 17 other properties mainly in Heidelberg and Mogale City.This is as part of its drive to cut costs. One of our key roles is to provide a uniform framework for the management and optimisation of immovable assets, GDID MEC Jacob Mamabolo said.The Government Immovable Asset Management Act states that as a custodian of government property, the GDID should act as a caretaker and may acquire, manage and dispose immovable assets under its custodianship. Our mandate to dispose of none-core assets comes in the wake of another critical milestone in the form of the conclusion of a property audit. The process resulted in the establishment of the provincial Immovable Asset Register valued at more than R30bn, he said.The register consists of more than 7000 pieces of land, and 6000 residential properties and nature reserves, parking lots, farms, commercial buildings and museums.Ntombi Nkosintombin@thenewage.co.za
