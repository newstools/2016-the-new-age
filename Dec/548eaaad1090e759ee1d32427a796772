Ephraim Shakes Mashaba has been fired as Bafana Bafana coach.iSAFA ibulale uVan Damme. Shakes Mashaba out, Whose next? spoko&#8217;mathambo (@Jabulani_Motha) December 22, 2016A source close to the matter said the last straw for Safa was when Mashaba went off the rails, following Bafana s 2-1 victory over Senegal in a World Cup qualifier in Polokwane.Mashaba spared none of his assumed critics, directing his profanity-laced tirade to the media and his bosses inside the dressing room, the source said. You don t support me but you are sabotaging me just like the journalists, Mashaba allegedly said in addition to other unprintable remarks. I m being criticised. I was called a dead man before this match. Mashaba has been under tremendous pressure in recent months, particularly after he failed to qualify for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. The World Cup qualifier victory clearly brought him a huge sigh of relief.Mashaba allegedly pointed a condemning finger at Safa president Danny Jordaan in a blatant act of disrespect caught on camera.&nbsp;I strongly believe that Danny had an agenda with Shakes Mashaba!
