South Africa s third largest food company Foodcorp was successful in a bid to have the Competition Commission provide it with additional information in a price fixing case as the Competition Tribunal has given the commission until January 31 to provide clarity on some of the charges against one of four companies in the sector. Foodcorp asked the tribunal to order the commission to amend its complaint referral to the tribunal, saying the present referral is vague and embarrassing . The three other companies investigated by the commission, have settled. Saldanha Foods (Pty) Ltd admitted it contravened the Competition Act when it agreed to fix prices paid to vessel owners or operators, skippers and crew for the service of catching pelagic fish between the mid-1990s and 2010 . Saldanha Foods agreed to pay a penalty of R406m for its involvement while Oceana Brands Limited and Premier Fishing SA have paid penalties of R34.7m and R2.1m. Foodcorp in its hearing said the allegations were not detailed enough to answer the case against them. The tribunal agreed that certain of the complaints required clarification. It s alleged by the commission that Pioneer and Foodcorp entered into at least three agreements between 2002 and 2009 during which they fixed the price of pelagic fish to retailers and wholesalers and this was done by the exchange of sensitive information. Pioneer also repeatedly put pressure on Foodcorp to increase its prices. The tribunal further asked for clarity on a number of matters such as to what agreements or concerted practices had taken place, or what prices were fixed. It s also not clear if or when Pioneer exchanged its price list with Foodcorp, that sensitive information was exchanged. Foodcorp will have 20 days to respond once the commission has submitted its amended complaint. -TNA Repoter|business@thenewage.co.za
