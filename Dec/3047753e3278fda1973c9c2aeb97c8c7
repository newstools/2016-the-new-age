As thousands of Mamelodi Sundowns fans were frequently visiting their branch notice boards for announcements of who was going to Japan, two brothers from the Northern Cape were preparing for the trip.Not even the prospect of spending R100000 from their own savings could deter Allister and Elnado Davids from making the trip to the Land of the Rising Sun.Making their way via Dubai to Japan, the siblings from Postmasburg said their initial plan was to go to Egypt for the Champions League final, but social unrest in the country saw them opt for the Club World Cup instead.Disappointed that the team did not win, the brothers are going to watch Sundowns play Asian champions Jeonbuk Hyundai, before travelling to Yokohama to watch Real Madrid on Thursday. It s something I have always wanted to do. I am disappointed the team lost, but to be part of this experience where Sundowns became the first team in South Africa to play at the Club World Cup is huge, Alister Davids said.But what has impressed Allister, 38, and his younger brother, Elnado, 22? It has to be the public transport system. It is effective and on time. Their train system is the best. The people are friendly, even though they don t like the English language. There is also the way the city is so clean. People don t litter. Even pedestrians respect the rules of the road in the same way motorists do, Alister said.But what stood out for Elnado, who interestingly is not a Sundowns fan, but a die-hard Orlando Pirates fan? The people are clean. I was so shocked to see that they have electronic, automatic toilets. I have never seen that before. I am also looking forward to seeing the best player in the world, Cristiano Ronaldo. MMASEKEPE MATSEBANEmmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
