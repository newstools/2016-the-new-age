The Court of Arbitration for Sport said Monday that Sepp Blatter breached FIFA&#8217;s ethics codes as it firmly rejected his appeal against a six year ban for making a $2 million payment to ousted UEFA chief Michel Platini.&#8220;Mr Blatter breached the FIFA Code of Ethics since the payment amounted to an undue gift as it had no contractual basis,&#8221; said the CAS in a statement which said Blatter&#8217;s appeal had been &#8220;dismissed.&#8221;&#8211;AFP
