England captain Dylan Hartley was banned for six weeks on Wednesday for striking an opponent playing for his club Northampton, European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) said in a statement.The 30-year-old hooker, who will be available for the start of England&#8217;s Six Nations campaign, was shown a red card for a swinging arm tackle shortly after coming on as a replacement in the European Champions Cup match against Leinster on Friday.Hartley, previously banned for 54 weeks in his career for offences including eye-gouging, biting and verbally abusing referees, was named England captain by coach Eddie Jones this year and led the team to 13 wins in a row.&#8220;In upholding the red card decision, the Committee found that the offence was at the mid-range of World Rugby&#8217;s sanctions and selected five weeks as the appropriate entry point,&#8221; EPCR said.&#8220;Taking into account Hartley&#8217;s poor disciplinary record, the Committee added two weeks to the sanction and then reduced the sanction by one week due to the player&#8217;s guilty plea before imposing a suspension of six weeks.&#8221;Hartley missed the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia in 2013 due to suspension and was omitted from the England squad for last year&#8217;s World Cup because of a ban for head-butting.He is among the leading candidates to captain the Lions on next year&#8217;s tour of New Zealand, along with Ireland hooker Rory Best and Wales lock Alun Wyn Jones.Hartley will be free to play again on Jan. 23.
