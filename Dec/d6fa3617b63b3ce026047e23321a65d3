HE IS usually a calm figure but lately Augusto Palacios is anything but composed. Like many, the Orlando Pirates interim coach is baffled by underperforming international players in his team. Not long ago, Palacios launched a thinly veiled attack on his players, triggered by the defeat to Maritzburg United, and fell short of questioning their commitment to the Buccaneers course. The veteran Bucs coach could not hide his frustration as the team suffered its first loss under his guidance, a 2-1 which further gnawed on dropping confidence levels. The performance of certain players is unacceptable, Palacios said. If players are not performing, I need to make changes. I make changes because of poorly performing players. I cannot allow players at a professional stage to give poor performances, it s impossible. There are supporters who are coming here to watch the game and I think some of the players did not put in 100% effort against Maritzburg and that is wrong. But what I m saying is that even an international campaigner, a player who knows what he can do and does not perform, he needs to have space for another one.You cannot rely on certain names. You need a player who wants to play and make it happen. The Buccaneers, however, are not far from the log leaders, trailing Cape Town City by seven points with two games in hand. They will host struggling Bloemfontein Celtic tonight in their closing encounter of 2016 at the Orlando Sta- dium, before they go on a long festive break.The PSL has not scheduled fixtures for January due to the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon. Tendai Ndoro has carried much of the scoring responsibilities, proving to be the driving force for the four wins Pirates have registered in the league. The Zimbabwean has netted 11 of the 13 goals that the entire team has managed to score so far this season.kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za-Kgomotso Sethusha
