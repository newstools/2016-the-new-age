Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe is detrmined not to let his players rest on their laurels as he focuses on securing a victory against Southampton this weekend after his side beat Premier League champions Leicester City on Tuesday.Bournemouth host the Saints, their south-coast rivals, on Sunday having provisionally climbed into eighth place on 21 points by beating Leicester 1-0 at home.&#8220;We&#8217;re building nicely. The team is growing and getting better and there&#8217;s still a lot more to come,&#8221; Howe told British media after the game.&#8220;For me, I&#8217;m always looking for more and to achieve the next goal, and that&#8217;s to try to beat Southampton.&#8221;Bournemouth are within touching distance of the European qualifying places and a win against 11th-placed Southampton, would reinforce their challenge for a Europa League place but Howe is not getting carried away just yet.&#8220;The club has come so far so quickly, sometimes it&#8217;s maybe nice for others to sit back and enjoy the position we&#8217;re in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to say Europe, I&#8217;m going to say I want to make the team better. I want to make the team stronger.&#8221;Southampton, who visit Stoke City on Wednesday, are a point behind the Cherries and will aim to move above them with a win.-Reuters
