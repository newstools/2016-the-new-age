The only sure way for Ajax Cape Town to avoid a relegation scrap is to beat teams in the bottom half of the log. That way, not only will Ajax Cape Town avoid being sucked into a relegation whirlpool, but they could also have a relaxed Christmas .This is the firm belief of Ajax coach Stanley Menzo, who aims to maintain a new-found momentum with a third successive league win against Highlands Park tomorrow. The Urban Warriors face a tricky-looking trip to Makhulong stadium where a desperate bottom-placed Highlands lie in wait. I keep telling my players that we can defeat teams nearest to us &#8230; so as for them to not come any closer, Menzo said. The aim is to get good results to get ahead and make them (nearest rivals) take steps backward. That s the plan, to get far ahead of teams lower in the league. Beating Sundowns was like a bonus, but beating teams in our situation is more important. The motivation will be different for the Highlands game. I told the players if you keep that motivation in mind and win three in a row, you can have a good Christmas. We need to give our fans, ourselves, our families and the club a relaxed Christmas. kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za-Kgomotso Sethusha
