It is a matter of weeks before the 2016 matric results are announced and education MEC Sello Lehari, who earlier this year undertook to put North West in second position nationally in terms of the pass rate, looks forward to the results with bated breath.This is an ambitious but attainable position from the MEC especially because North West managed to attain second positions during 2014 and 2015 matric exams.Matric results are going to be announced on January 5 at Batlhaping Secondary School in Taung and Lehari will release the results, detailing how the province s 35 397 performed in the examinations that ended on November 29.Marking is under way and it seems early days for anyone to give a proper assessment of how the 2016 class performed.To his credit, Lehari hit the ground running and in one of his first actions as MEC, he met with principals of all high schools in Mahikeng where he said the department and its stakeholders will be driven by the theme: Reaching gold status to improve results.The meeting brought together more than 300 high school principals from all over the province.It was also used as a half-year reflection session to outline overall expectations of the department, boost staff morale and to share best practice on how to improve year-end results.Lehari was clear in outlining his vision for the department and he implored school principals to join him in having an attitude and determination for success.He said that it was imperative that principals, as school and society leaders, maintain professional work ethics and advance curriculum for the benefit of the African child. We need to aim for gold status. A second position nationally with position one as a bonus should be what we envisage aiming for, with at least 50 schools obtaining a 100% pass, he said.Lehari further said the syllabus should be wrapped up by August 2016 so that rigorous preparations for the examinations start early.He thanked principals for the progress made in advancing the curriculum for North West pupils.North West has 398 high schools with 35519 candidates registered for 2016 National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations.Though the provincial government praised the 2015 matric classes for a good performance concern was raised over the drop in the pass percentage and the province s position.North West Province obtained 81.5% in 2015 which represented a drop from the 84.6% of 2014.A number of factors were cited as some of the contributing factors to the undesirable outcomes.Premier Supra Mahumapelo said that considering the increased number of candidates that wrote the 2015 matric examination, there was every reason to congratulate all education stakeholders in the province. The number of candidates who passed this year s NSC is the highest ever in the province. The fact that 5057 more candidates passed from this cohort is a major achievement compared to the previous years, he said.There were also disturbances in some areas where community protests led to the closure of school and pupils in areas like Ganyesa and Kopela had to be transferred to Vryburg so that they could write their examinations.However, the ANCYL said that the education and sport development department should implement effective policies to make sure that the province bounces back into the top two positions when it when the 2016 matric results are announced.This is the view of the ANC Youth League in the North West, which strongly believes that more can be done by the department, teachers and students to improve the provincial standards at matric level.ANCYL provincial spokesperson Tshiamo Tsotetsi urged educational authorities to leave no stone unturned to ensure that the province attains a higher matric ranking this year. After careful consideration of the results we believe that, as a province, we can do better. We managed to attain second position nationally in 2013 and 2014 but we dropped to number four and while this is not a huge drop, everyone must still be concerned with this development, he said.Tsotetsi said that much needed to be done to improve the teaching standards across most schools in the province. We have to ask ourselves questions about whether or not we have well qualified teachers at matric level. It is important, in our view, for the department to look at the calibre of teachers that are being employed because at the end of the day this will also affect the quality of students that we are able to produce, he said.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
