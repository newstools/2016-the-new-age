After enjoying a fairytale run with Wales at Euro 2016, defender Neil Taylor is desperate for &#8216;that winning feeling&#8217; to return at Swansea City.The club are second from bottom but have a chance to climb out of the Premier League relegation zone with home games coming up against West Ham United on Dec. 26 and Bournemouth five days later.&#8220;It&#8217;s been a year where you experience the two extremes of being a footballer,&#8221; said the 27-year-old Taylor who was part of the Wales side that reached the semi-finals of the European Championship in France.&#8220;You always try to keep yourself on the same level but when you win it is a huge feeling of relief and when you lose it really, really hurts,&#8221; he told reporters.Swansea have shipped a league-high 37 goals in 17 matches this season and were beaten 3-0 at Middlesbrough on Saturday.&#8220;There has been a lot of frustration, we are desperate to get back to having that winning feeling. We don&#8217;t like the feeling of being where we are any more than the fans do,&#8221; said Taylor.&#8220;It hurts but we are the ones who can change that and that is what we want to do with these big games coming up.&#8221;-Reuters
