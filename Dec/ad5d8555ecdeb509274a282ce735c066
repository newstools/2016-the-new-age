The Road Accident Fund (RAF) has launched a unique campaign to ensure that the stories of people on their way to their destination get told.A recent promotion, the excitement of an umpcoming wedding, managing to write exams in the midst of campus turmoil, or the disappointment of not getting a bonus are some of the stories families and friends share when they reunite.RAF CEO Eugene Watson said the look and feel of the festive season campaign would show the beauty of SA s roads while painting a picture of the many stories that the roads carried with them.The campaign consisted of internal communication as well as a consumerfacing campaign that would include video, radio, social media, activations and public relations. Not everyone will be travelling far this holiday season. For some, it may only be a kilometre or two while for others it will be hundreds of kilometres away, Watson said. It s not about the distance but safety yours, your family s, friends and above ball everyone who shares the road with you. The common thread is that everyone s life matters, particularly at this time of year when we have stories to tell. Family news, exam results, job woes our roads carry many stories. Let s make sure they end well. Watson said the messaging would breathe new life into the RAF s existing My Road Your Road safety campaign, which is about the roads belonging to everyone . It appeals to our sense of community and above all encourages empathy and respect by acting responsibility, he said.RAF chief marketing officer Phumi Dhlomo said: We have taken the #MyRoadYourRoad concept up a notch this festive season by appealing to people s emotions or tugging at their heart strings during this time of togetherness. All we ask is that people keep their senses and get home in one piece so they can recap all the highs and lows of 2016, before entering the New Year. The RAF has urged claimants to make enquiries regarding accidents on 0860 23 55 23.VINCENT CRUYWAGEN
