We are marking this day under the theme; Celebrating 20 years of the Constitution transforming society and uniting the nation.The Constitution is the birth certificate of democratic South Africa. It provides the legal foundation for the existence of the democratic South Africa.It commits us, individually and collectively, to build a nation based on the democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom, through constitutionalism and the rule of law. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land and contains an important democratic principle called the separation of powers.A key feature of the Constitution is a welldeveloped system of checks and balances.These include judicial review, the independent judiciary, legislative oversight over the executive and the establishment of Chapter 9 institutions, which are mandated to promote and protect various human rights.Our courts are trusted final arbiters in disputes in society To maintain this role, our judiciary needs to jealously guard its independence, impartiality, dignity, accessibility and effectiveness. Other arms of the state must support the judiciary to maintain this role.Access to justice continues to improve in the countryAn important meeting took place last year at the Union Buildings to discuss problems in the working relations between the Executive and the Judiciary, for the first time ever in our democracy and an significant signal that the system works and that mechanisms exist to iron out any difficulties.When the three arms function effectively and smoothly, the people benefit.Parliament also continues to function effectively, with members of parliament conducting their oversight work over the government, ensuring government departments provide services to the people and that budgets are spent in line with the work that needs to be done.The Bill of Rights remains one of the fundamental features of our Constitution, affirming the democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom.One of its key features are the rights of assembly and association as well as the freedom of expression and the freedom of the media. The Bill of Rights also contains socioeconomic rights, including rights to education, healthcare, social security or water and electricity.Much work has been done since 1994 to ensure the enjoyment of these rights to the people. Concrete steps have been taken since 1994, to remove the laws upon which institutionalised racial discrimination was based.The government further introduced a new regulatory environment to promote black economic advancement and affirmative action, in order to reverse the legacy of racial discrimination in the workplace and the economy.Laws promoting, among other things, employment equity, broad-based black economic empowerment and the prevention of unfair discrimination were enacted to promote economic transformation.The dismantling of the legal framework of apartheid and the transformation of many state institutions has led to visible improvement of the socio-economic conditions of millions of people. Our Constitution enjoins us to educate our children and youth to become future leaders and proficient citizens.That is why the government has expanded access and improved the quality of education.There has been a steady increase in the overall matric pass rate to reach 71% last year.We want to see more pupils achieving bachelor passes this year.Since 1994 we have almost doubled the number of students in higher education institutions to close to a million students.The doors of learning are being opened. Advances have been made towards building a healthy nation. South Africans now live longer, with the average age being 62 years in 2014.More importantly, we have made dramatic inroads in the fight against HIV-Aids.Work continues to make South Africa safer for all.Police work around the clock to fight crime The Constitution says we must heal the divisions of the past. In this regard, we all need to play our part in building a non-racial society.The recent reported displays of racism in the country indicate that more work must still be done to fight racism.A lot of progress has been made in promoting unity in our country Further work is being done to promote a society free of all forms of discrimination.With regards to promoting gender equality, we are pleased that the Constitution has enabled us to advance more women in our society, with 42.5% of women having been elected into legislative bodies in 2014.We urge all of you to continue to be vigilant and promote safer homes, communities and workplaces for women, every day of the year.Women have a right to safety and security.Our Constitution is our precious heritage It has been an excellent guide in the journey of building a new national democratic society in the past 20 years of its existence. Let us stand together as a united, sovereign, democratic state and strengthen our efforts of building a nation free from poverty, inequality and unemployment, together.This an edited version of President Jacob Zuma s speech on the occasion of celebrating 20 years of signing into law South Africa s Constitution held on Saturday at the George Thabe Stadium, Sedibeng district municipality
