Ravichandran Ashwin tore through England&#8217;s lower order in just half-an-hour on Monday as India won the fourth Test by an innings and 36 runs, clinching the series 3-0 with a game to spare.England started the final day at the Wankhede Stadium trailing by 49 runs with four wickets remaining, and needing something extraordinary to avoid defeat.But off-spinner Ashwin grabbed all four wickets to send England crashing to 195 all out and finish with figures of 6-55 in the innings, and 12 scalps in the match.Skipper Virat Kohli was named man of the match for his brilliant double century in a crushing win that confirms India as Test cricket&#8217;s top side and avenges their two consecutive series defeats to England.&#8220;This series win is probably the sweetest we have had in the last 14-15 months,&#8221; said Kohli, who took over from Mahendra Singh Dhoni as Test captain last year.England captain Alastair Cook, who has hinted he may step down after the series, admitted it was a mistake to pick only two specialist spinners in Mumbai&#8217;s spin-friendly conditions.&#8220;We would have liked another spinner but we had the opportunity to bowl India out for 400 and we did not take them,&#8221; said Cook.Ashwin first dispatched Jonny Bairstow, who could only add one run to his overnight half-century, before clean-bowling Chris Woakes for nought.Adil Rashid was then caught in the deep by Lokesh Rahul for two, off Ashwin&#8217;s bowling, to put England at 193 with just one wicket remaining.James Anderson was then caught to become Ashwin&#8217;s sixth victim of the innings as England were all out for 195, failing to make India bat again.England posted 400 in their first innings before India put on a massive 631, including Kohli&#8217;s double century and tons for Murali Vijay and Jayant Yadav.Kohli struck 235 runs for his third double century of the year, while Yadav&#8217;s 104 marked his maiden Test hundred.England were already up against it going into the second innings and they slumped to 182-6 by the end of day four.Opener Keaton Jennings was out for a golden duck while Cook could only make 18 as England&#8217;s batsman failed to cope with India&#8217;s spin attack.As well as Ashwin&#8217;s 6-55, Ravindra Jadeja grabbed 2-63 as Kohli&#8217;s side humbled the visitors.Kohli said Ashwin, who is the top-ranked bowler in world cricket, had once again proved to be a class apart.&#8220;We are running out of words to describe his performances,&#8221; said the Indian skipper.&#8220;Where we stand today &#8212; 50 to 60 percent of that is Ashwin&#8217;s effort&#8230; The batsmen are playing second fiddle to that.&#8221;Cook also paid tribute to Kohli&#8217;s batting, saying his Indian counterpart had led from the front and was in the form of his life.&#8220;Clearly (he is) one of the greatest batsmen of our generation,&#8221; said Cook, the highest scorer among current Test players.The fifth Test, which will be a dead rubber, starts in Chennai later this week.
