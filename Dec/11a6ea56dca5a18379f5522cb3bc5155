Romania&#8217;s President Klaus Iohannis rejected the leftist Social Democrat Party&#8217;s (PSD) proposal to name Sevil Shhaideh for prime minister designate, he said on Tuesday.&#8220;I have carefully weighed the pro and con arguments and I have decided not to appoint Mrs Sevil Shhaideh,&#8221; Iohannis told reporters. &#8220;As a result, I am asking the PSD and (coalition partner) ALDE to make a new proposal.&#8221;Together with its long-time ally ALDE, the PSD has an outright majority in parliament with 250 members in the 465-seat two-house assembly, allowing them to easily give their government a vote of confidence and pass legislation.-Reuters
