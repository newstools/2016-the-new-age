The drop is because of better preparedness through the various partnerships between local authorities, landowners, Fire Protection Associations and community members, WoF provincial spokesperson Lebogang Maseko said.WoF s community awareness training officer Mbuso Siwela works closely with local municipalities, communities and landowners. He does fire safe workshops in schools, home-based care centres and early childhood centres.The WoF office in Mpumalanga received recognition from the SANDF for its sterling work in integrated fire management and community fire awareness activities.WoF manages an integrated fire management programme which includes fire management planning, detection, prevention, suppression, dispatch and coordination and community fire awareness activities.Siwela received the award on behalf of WoF management during an award ceremony at the Bundu Lodge in Nelspruit.The WoF is in a three-year partnership with the SANDF.

We have been in partnership with the SANDF since 2014 and visited the Zonstraal Military Base in October to raise awareness to military personnel on how to prevent and manage unwanted fires, Siwela said.He said receiving the award was not just a pat on the back, but an assurance that their work was progressive.The SANDF s Capt Siboniso Maseko said the award symbolised a good partnership and the valuable support they have received from WoF throughout the years.WoF also seeks to addressthe prevention and control of wildlandfires to enhance the sustainability and protection of life, property and the environment through the implementation of integrated fire management products and services.
