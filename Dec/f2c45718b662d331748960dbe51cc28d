PLATINUM Stars captain Vuyo Mere is worried about the team s poor performances, despite the team showing slight improvement in the league in the last few games. It is no secret that Stars got their Premiership campaign off to an uncharacteristically poor start, dropping points at an alarming rate. However, there seems to be a change in fortune.They ended their four-match losing streak with an emphatic 4-0 win over newly-crowned Telkom Knockout champions, Cape Town City a week ago. And one would have expected them to continue with their winning form, but it was not to be as they were held to a goalless draw against Maritzburg United at home at the weekend.They hardly have time for respite as they go back to action tonight, visiting struggling Highlands Park at the Makhulong Stadium. Mere, a veteran of more than 200 PSL games and a club stalwart has admitted they are battling for consistency, though he insisted they were working hard to improve on their 12th spot on the log. We have been grafting and not getting the results, Mere said. We have assembled a great squad. With the talent we have around us it is unbelievable to find ourselves in this position. It is about time we come out of this hole and be where we deserve to be. We know we are capable of achieving more things and we have done it before. While it is a norm for local clubs to blame the coach when a team underperforms, the 32-year-old defender has laid the blame firmly at the feet of the players. We as players put ourselves in this hole and it s about time we pull ourselves out of it. news@thenewage.co.za-Ntsako Mashaba
