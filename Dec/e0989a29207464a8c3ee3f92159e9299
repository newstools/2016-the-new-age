The government has told families and community members it was their duty to ensure that boys did not die when they went to initiation school.Cooperative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta) spokesperson Mamkeli Ngam said he was saddened for all 19 families that lost their sons during their initiation in the Eastern Cape. The government has to get involved now because people are dying. We are creating awareness for safe ways for communities to carry out the tradition without people having to die. We want families to take their boys for a pre-medical check-up before they get circumcised, if there is medication needed then they can go to initiation school with the prescribed medication, Ngam said.Cogta encouraged parents to check up on their children at the initiation schools to ensure they were being taken care of and not abused. The main issue that most boys tend to face is with dehydration. There is a heat wave and we need to make sure that these boys are taken care of, Ngam said.Community member of Nkonkoni village Mthatha Siyanda Ngxaza said the initiation schools were necessary because its an important part of culture. The boys have to survive hard times because there is a change in their diet which does not affect the boys in the same way hence you find that other boys will die from dehydration or other ills. It is common that boys will eat food without salt without oil and water with sand which is said to help with the healing process, and maize, Ngxaza said.Ngxaza said circumcision in the hospital was very safe. However if a boy did not go to initiation school by the age of 18 and older, they will not be recognised in their community as a real man who can attend community meetings.He said there was a level of peer pressure forcing boys younger than 18 to attend initiation school without their parents consent. The peer pressure has sometimes resulted in other boys committing suicide because they are not recognised as men, Ngxaza said.provinces@thenewage.co.za
