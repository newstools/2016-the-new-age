The South African u20 Men s National Team (Amajita) has qualified for the semi-final of the COSAFA Cup u20 tournament with an unblemished record, after beating eliminated Botswana 1-0 at Moruleng Stadium in Rustenburg on Monday afternoon (12 December).The Burger King-sponsored Amajita, who had already qualified for the penultimate stage after walloping Lesotho 8-0 and Swaziland 1-0, used most of their fringe players in the dead rubber match with neighbours Botswana.The South Africans have now scored 10 goals in the group stages, conceded none and are still to lose a match.Although they initially struggled against Botswana, the Thabo Senong-led team pushed a gear up in the second half in which they missed some gilt-edged chances, but once Sibongakonke Mbatha had given them the lead late into the second half, the writing was on the wall with regards to the final outcome.Speedy winger Sifundo Sibiya made a darting run on the left flank before he crossed the ball for Mbatha whose shot came off the upright before rolling into an empty net.Amajita will now meet Angola in the semi final on Wednesday (14 December ) while Zambia will play DR Congo in the other semi-final encounter.The final will take place on Friday (16 December ) to wind off the two week long tournament.
