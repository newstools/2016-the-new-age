Maritsburg United are undecided on whether to bring on board Roger d e Sa or Julio Leal to replace Ernst Middendorp.The New Age has learnt that De Sa, who stepped down as Ajax Cape Town coach owing to poor results, has told the Maritzburg management he was eyeing a Bafana Bafana coaching post.Incumbent Ephraim Shakes Mashaba s future is bleak as he faces the sack, following a bust-up with his Safa bosses last month. Mashaba faces a disciplinary hearing to answer charges of misconduct, among others, after Bafana Bafana s victory over Senegal in Polokwane. The management is divided on who to replace Middendorp, a source in the Maritzburg camp said. Some want Roger but he has asked them to wait a while because he wants to apply for the Bafana Bafana coaching job should Shakes be released. On the other hand, others want Leal. His salary package, however, could be a stumbling block. Before the December break, the new coach will be in town. In the meantime, Maritzburg have recorded two wins in three games under caretaker coach Fadlu Davids.The Team of Choice first upset Ajax 2-1 on November 19 but were summarily brought down to Earth by in form Cape Town City, who defeated them 3-2 three days later in back-to-back fixtures hosted by the Mother City sides.At the weekend, the KZN side claimed an all-important 1-0 victory over Baroka FC at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Limpopo.The win, the third of the season after 12 matches, took Maritzburg to ninth spot with 14 points. Meanwhile, Middendorp has been linked with a move back to struggling Bloemfontein Celtic.The Mangaung side has former stars Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka taking charge and are placed 13th on the log with 10 points from 10 matches. Under then coach Serame Letsokaka, Celtic only managed two wins and he was eventually released.But sources close to Maritzburg disclosed Middendorp would only leave for another club once he paid a certain amount as per a clause in his contract.Linda Ximba| sports@thenewage.co.za
