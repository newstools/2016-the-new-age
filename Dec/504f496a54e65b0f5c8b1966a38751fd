As I write this article I am impelled by mixed emotions that have marked my responsibilities as the chief whip of the majority party since I took office this year.It is indeed a bitter-sweet moment for us that we were able to persuade Parliament not only to hold a debate in honour and commemoration of the passing of El Commandante Fidel Castro Ruz, but also to send a multiparty delegation to his funeral memorial in Santiago.It is the first time in history that our Parliament has passed a condolence motion and resolved to send a delegation to attend the funeral of a world leader and icon outside the borders of South Africa.While we mourn the passing of this selfless anti-imperialist internationalist we are also humbled by the contribution we have made through Parliament in his honour.We did all of this and gave these accolades to this outstanding gallant leader of all the poor, marginalised and oppressed people throughout the world, informed by the immense contribution that Castro made to the democracy and freedom we enjoy today.I also reluctantly call to memory some of the painful moments of my time as chief whip. Yes, it was painful to hold memorial services and attend funerals of fellow members of Parliament, especially those from the ANC who passed away and with whom I served in this Parliament.However, what was excruciatingly painful and a low point in my life was to have to write a letter and speak to an ANC member of Parliament to inform her that Parliament had formally terminated her membership as a consequence of her activities in the previous local government elections. Equally painful, was when some members of Parliament just decided not to be present in the house and as a result we failed twice to pass the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill.Ill-discipline from some ANC members caused the failure to pass the bill, which brought enormous embarrassment and disappointment to all of us as ANC MPs, including our organisation, and called to question our commitment to the mandate we carry from the electorate. We are in the process of disciplining those who caused us this harm.Parliament as a multi-party forum of democratic debate depends on consensus and political management of the institution, inclusive of its programmes. We appreciate and continue to attempt to engender and enhance cooperation and collegiality among parties, this we believe is what our forebears like oresident Nelson Mandela and Mama Sisulu who are our trail bearers in the corridors of this institution expect of us in this state of affairs.In our parliamentary toolkit to hold the executive accountable, we continue to emphasise the progressive policies of the ANC and the implementation thereof by all in government departments, state owned enterprises or institutions supporting democracy.Reducing unemployment, poverty and curbing inequalities that persist, despite 22 years of our democratic dispensation and ensuring the realisation of the ideals of the Freedom Charter and attaining the objectives of the National Development Plan remain our benchmark in exercising oversight over the government.After suffering from criticism after criticism from civil society specifically and the people of South Africa in general, on how non-transparent we were in appointing people to statutory institutions, we have listened and remedied our wrongdoings. We now emphasise the utmost transparency and meaningful public participation throughout the stages of the appointment process, as enshrined in the Constitution.We have also endeavoured to secure consensus by all political parties when recommending candidates for appointment and have since been able to recommend the best candidates for appointment. In this regard all but one party agreed with the then candidate for the public protector position, the same is true regarding the candidate for the position of the inspector-general of intelligence. This transparent approach to appointments by Parliament has been followed in relation to commissioners for the South African Human Rights Commission as well as the Public Service Commission.The almost unanimous support of the candidates alluded to above, beyond narrow party political lines, has engendered the notion of a people-centred activist Parliament working in the interest of all our people and our country.We have also strengthened the involvement of smaller parties in debate in a manner that does not diminish their visibility and participation in parliamentary processes. All parties are now able to meaningfully participate in making members statements and giving notices of motion a far cry from the past.Another area where we have worked together but also at times differed, has been in the passing of legislation. In this regard, we were able to pass the budget within the prescribed time in the beginning of the year. In the same vein, despite some hurdles alluded to earlier, we were able to pass the bill on the third attempt later in the year.The genesis of this state of affairs further raises a more fundamental question as to whether the obstructionist tactics of the opposition manifest in breaking the quorum by calling for a division and subsequently staying away from the chamber en masse during voting time, is in the best interests of the people and our country, in light of the mandate we carry collectively as members of Parliament.As members, we are expected to pass laws and our rules make provision for those who hold a different view from the majority to duly register their objections. If the ANC were to employ similar obstructionist tactics in metros that are governed by opposition coalitions in processing items, the ANC differs in principle with including in the passing of the budgets, would South Africans deem it acceptable and patriotic for service delivery to be obstructed in favour of party-political interest?My own view is that these tactics are undesirable and non-patriotic. However, notwithstanding the ill-informed tactical walk-outs of the opposition we have been able to pass several pieces of legislation that came before our Parliament in the year.Another area of our work is holding the executive to account through, among others, questions to ministers held almost fortnightly on a rotational basis according to the four committee clusters of Parliament. All parties have found these opportunities being effective in extracting from ministers the extent to which they have implemented their own programmes, as informed by ANC policy.Through these mechanisms we have been able to inform our people about our government in areas of the economy, peace and security, social transformation and governance.Apart from a minister s obligation to respond to questions, in the year we have also continued to have President Zuma and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa responding to questions in the house, quarterly or monthly.The question and response sessions of both the president and the deputy president have assisted all of us to be familiar with the direction our country is taking in relation to a number of aspects including but not limited to economic transformation and implementation of our international agreements.Parliament needs to find a better way, within its existing rules, to regulate engagements with the president when he comes to the house for questions, the state of the nation address and the presidency budget vote.Some parties abuse the parliamentary system to the extent of unsettling the house, in most instances when the president is in the house. This is the challenge that the two houses of Parliament and all parties need to attend to expeditiously if we are to be taken seriously by our people.What has also been of critical importance in the work of Parliament has been the engagement of MPs in their constituency areas. The constituency offices of MPs create an environment in which MPs are able to be apprised and informed of the various difficulties, hardships and challenges that constrain our people on a daily basis.Some of the challenges faced by our people include crime, unemployment and lack of skills by our citizenry to engage in productive employment. Of equal importance in areas that would confront MPs in their constituencies would be stubborn poverty levels and the persistent cry of communities in our country to be assisted out of the scourge of drugs and drug trafficking.It s these stubborn fault-lines in our communities that come from our apartheid past, which need ventilation and expression in our Parliament. We need to continuously dipstick the extent to which our democratic state and government address these fault-lines and what else still needs to be done.It is my strong view that the programme of Parliament plenary sessions should over and above members statements and notices of motion include plenary discussions on issues arising directly from constituency work.Such constituency-centric plenary debates would increase the relevance of our Parliament to the people of South Africa as our interaction with communities would then be a real and not an imagined part of our parliamentary activism. This is what we should be including in the programme of Parliament next year.Whereas Parliament interacts with various structures in the continental as well as the international arena, the process of keeping the entire Parliament informed about strategic matters serving before and decided by all international platforms we are involved in, leaves a lot to be desired. Parliament can do better and must endeavour to do better in the timeous consideration, debates and approval of matters that emanate from among others the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Inter-Parliamentary Union, Pan African Parliament and the SADC-PF. In the same vein, matters of international treaties, conventions and protocols can also be handled better than the current practice.All South Africans and patriots should decry and critique the levels of obstructionism, plain anarchy, grandstanding and playing to the gallery by some political parties in our Parliament. Notwithstanding the rowdy obstructionist anarchic conduct of some parties, Parliament has succeeded in effectively performing its tasks.To address anarchy and gross misconduct of some parties and members thereof, our rules have been strengthened to empower the presiding officers to remove from the chamber and precincts and even suspend members who wilfully disrupt the proceedings of the house and undermine the authority of the presiding officers. However, rules are not adequate to ensure decorum and smooth proceedings in the house. Those of us who are charged with the political management of Parliament need to work together to eliminate anarchy, including disruptions that occur when the president is in the house.One of the highlights of the work of Parliament this year, is the resolution to hold an enquiry into the SABC board s fitness to hold office. This arose after the board failed dismally to answer questions regarding the appointment of Hlaudi Motsoeneng as COO of the corporation and also the dismal performance of the SABC in relation to its financial management for the year 2015-16 among others. Parliament is confident that through this enquiry into the SABC board, the decline and total collapse of corporate governance in the institution will be arrested.As we end the year we appreciate the support we have had from our organisation the mighty, glorious ANC and its leadership and membership. We also take the opportunity to express our appreciation for the support we have received from the whips of the ANC members in Parliament and all ANC members of Parliament in the ANC parliamentary caucus. It would be remiss of us not to thank the support we received throughout the year from chief whips of other parties, despite some disagreements at times which were necessary but cordial. We further wish all South Africans a happy festive season and trust that we all enjoy this precious time with our families.Jackson MthembuJackson Mthembu is the ANC chief whip in Parliament
