As the year draws to an end, the rand finds itself on the back foot after a reasonably strong performance in the past few weeks.This as the US Federal Reserve decided to confirm the worst-kept secret in town by not only raising its benchmark interest rate but confirming a number of further upward moves are expected throughout next year.Markets and currencies around the world reacted.Before the Fed announcement late on Wednesday South African time, the rand was trading strongly compared with other emerging market currencies, including even against the dollar at R13.59/$, but took a nosedive after the decision to R14/$, a level last seen at the beginning of this month.The Fed move was only its second in 10 years and took the interest rate from 0.5% to 0.75%. South Africa s repo rate is 7%.By 2pm yesterday, the local currency was weaker by 1.61%, trading at R14.15/$. The currency was trading at around R13.20/$ just before the US elections.It then reached its weakest point of R14.60/$ in the wake of the surprise outcome, before recovering somewhat. Now it s back to square one.In the monetary policy committee meeting last month, Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago warned that the rand was expected to remain sensitive to changes in the stance of US monetary policy.John Cairns, RMB analyst, said yesterday that the Fed hike announcement was about as exciting as getting socks for Christmas.However, there was a sting in the tale. The projection of Fed members is now for three hikes next year rather than the two that they had previously forecast, Cairns said. The key move for the rand has come in the form of the dollar index s push to a 14-year high. The strong dollar has driven all before it, with USD/ZAR broadly reflecting what one would expect by pushing to an exact R14, Cairns said.However, he said that while there was no getting away from the dollar move overnight, in a broader sense the rand has remained remarkably resilient to the dollar s post-election surge.Arthur Kamp, Sanlam s investment economist, said if the Fed becomes more aggressive than anticipated this could accelerate the depreciation of the rand. If the depreciation of the rand does indeed lead to higher inflation, this will put upward pressure on South African interest rates, he said.Bernard Sathekgebernards@thenewage.co.za
