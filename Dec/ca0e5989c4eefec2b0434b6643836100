The closure of the diamond mines owned by giant mining house De Beers in the small town of Kleinzee, in the Namakwa district, not only left thousands of people jobless, it also led to the closing down of businesses and the migration of workers.Statistics South Africa says the population in the area dwindled from about 7000 in 2012 to just under 1000 today with many community members moving to neighbouring towns, while others, especially migrant workers, went back to their countries such as Lesotho, Botswana and Namibia.The mines closure in 2012 resulted in a high rate of unemployment, which had a spiralling effect on businesses in the area, which were also forced to close down when migrant workers who were keeping it viable, were forced to return to their homes.Residents still remaining in the area complain there is nothing left but dilapidated buildings because the government had stopped infrastructure development.John Roseberg a former De Beers employee said life has never been the same since the mines closed and music festivals, which used to take place in the area, have stopped. There is nothing remaining here, lots of people have left the town. The only structures remaining are schools and health facilities, Roseberg said.He said the houses of the former employees are empty and sporting facilities, which used to be full during school holidays, are white elephants. The parks and craft and arts centres have been left to the dogs. The grass is left uncut and buildings are dilapidated. There is little the government is doing to uplift the living conditions of this place. The rich history of this area is slowly fading away, he said.Meanwhile, De Beers has said it was trying its best to restore the area to its former glory through the establishment of an oyster and an abalone farm just outside town.Dennis Clarke, an engineering supervisor at De Beers, said although the area is no longer economically viable, they have plans in place for job creation. Kleinzee will definitely continue existing and I estimate for at least another 30 years, even if the mines are closed, Clarke said.However, Roseberg said the town was slowly losing its significance and tourists that used to help the town s economy, were no longer coming.However, the Nama Khoi municipality said there were plans in place to revitalise the area and create employment. We plan to tar the road to Kleinzee T-junction, incorporate Eskom s electricity network and remove illegal waste dumps, the municipality said.The municipality also plans to upgrade tourism attractions and multipurpose centres, and embark on solar water-heating and renewable energy projects.TIISETSO MANOKO
