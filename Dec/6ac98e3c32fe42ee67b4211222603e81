Durban&#8217;s filmmaker Charles Matthews is delighted at scooping three awards at the South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance/Afda awards for his 24-minute film, Mandlakhe.He won awards for best director, best screenplay and best 24-minute film.Mandlakhe is a drama set both in a rural town outside Tongaat and in the city of Durban. The film is about an elderly man who leaves his home and travels to Durban in search of his son. I lived in Swaziland for a little while and every day when I took my dogs for a walk I saw an old man sitting on a mound of sand with a big white hat and he d just greet everyone that walked past. And he just sat there, day, in day out with a little dog that walked around with him. People would bring him food and kind of look after this old guy that just sat there. Every day I just wondered what is this guy s story? Why is he sitting there? Is he waiting for somebody? Mathews said this was where the film s inspiration came from. The lead character Baba K asks a young girl in his village to read letters that his son Mandlakazi had posted to him from the big city.It is in a taxi ride to Durban that Baba K encounters a young man who would guide him to a surprising twist at the end of the film.Matthews says the film also depicts the tussle between old and young, and old school values versus the modern world. It s just a simple story about love and hope and it s something that will hopefully leave people feeling good.We re on a journey that the destination isn t as important as the actual journey in the film. and you realise that at the end, Matthews said.Matthews says the film industry in KwaZulu-Natal has huge potential for local and international productions. We ve got everything. We ve got mountains, beaches and perfect weather for shooting. I think it s just a great place to be. The film features sterling and emotional performances by actors that have never ever dabbled in acting before.TNA REPORTER
