Robert McBride has been slammed for refusing to make a warning statement to the Hawks.Constitutional law expert Prof Shadrack Gutto said McBride as a law enforcement agency official should be exemplary and comply with the summons. However, the Hawks have been seen as a rogue unit for its political master. As a result there is a mistrust in the Hawks and the elite crime unit has been hit by a series of scandals, Gutto said.He said the Hawks should investigate the matter and prefer a charge after gathering enough evidence rather than summoning people.McBride was yesterday summoned to the Hawks offices to make a warning statement in an investigation related to defeating the ends of justice charge laid against him in 2007. The charge was later withdrawn.Hawks said they would make a written correspondence to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate head s lawyer to obtain his statement.Yesterday Hawks spokesperson Brig Hangwani Mulaudzi said they had noted McBride s stance and would communicate with his lawyers. We will also be seeking legal advice on this matter going forward because we need to maintain our professional relationship, he said.McBride has likened his case to that of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The charge related to tampering with evidence in the case against alleged notorious criminal Marco Singh.Yesterday Ipid said this was a campaign against McBride by the Minister of Police and the Hawks. This matter is 10 years old and was dealt with at that time. Clearly, the Hawks are not acting in the interests of justice. The manner in which this matter is being pursued by the Hawks is similar to the way in which they pursued spurious and frivolous charges against the Minister of Finance, which the NPA had to withdraw abruptly, Ipid spokes person Moses Dlamini said.DUDU DUBE AND PETER RAMOTHWALAdudud@thenewage.co.za
