FORMER Orlando Pirates coach Muhsin Ertugral is in no in a rush to get a new club, despite growing demands for his services. Ertugral left Pirates in a huff, following the 6-1 defeat suffered at the hands of SuperSport United last month, which prompted him to summarily hand in his resignation letter.Offers have been streaming in from overseas clubs, including one from his former club Baniyas, but none on the local front. But the Turkish coach says he is no in a hurry to sign on the dotted line with a new club. He has also dismissed rumours linking him with a move to Bloemfontein Celtic, who are without a permanent coach after parting ways with Serame Letsoaka over a month ago. At the moment it is not the time for me to jump to another team, Ertugral said. And it s not true that I ve been in talks with Celtic. I have not spoken to any club after I left Orlando Pirates. I was overseas and I have just came back. No team has approached me locally. I had an offer in the Middle East from the club I coached in 2006. I went to a couple of official meetings. But we were just talking about what I am going to need in future. Ertugral confirmed he had received offers from other European clubs, but would not divulge their names. The clubs that approached me overseas have coaches at the moment. So it wouldn t be wise to say anything about these clubs or mention their names. Ertugral landed his first job in South Africa in 1999 when he joined Kaizer Chiefs. He has since become one of the respected coaches in the domestic league, having had tenures at Santos, Ajax Cape Town, Golden Arrows, Mpumalanga Black Aces and Pirates. He has won numerous trophies, mostly with Kaizer Chiefs. Yet he has never won the prestigious of them all, the league championship and it was hoped he d achieve that goal with the Buccaneers before he suddenly left them.ntsakom@thenewage.co.za-Ntsako Mashaba
