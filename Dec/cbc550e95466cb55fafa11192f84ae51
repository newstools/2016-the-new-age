Ryder Cup star Rafa Cabrera Bello recovered from a late stumble to retain a share of the Hong Kong Open lead and move within sight of his first victory in four years on Saturday.The Spaniard leads alongside Australia&#8217;s Sam Brazel on 11-under-par 199 after surviving a double bogey on the par-four 14th by birdieing two of his last four holes for level-par 70.England&#8217;s Tommy Fleetwood fired three-under-par 67 to lie in sole second spot with an aggregate score of 201, one stroke better than America&#8217;s David Lipsky who shot 66.Cabrera Bello, a bright spot in Europe&#8217;s Ryder Cup defeat in October, is bidding to join fellow Spaniards Jose Maria Olazabal, Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jose Manuel Lara as a Hong Kong winner.&#8220;I had a tough day,&#8221; said Cabrera Bello, who has topped the leaderboard after all three rounds following his 64 and 65 on Thurday and Friday at Fanling.&#8220;I didn t find my rhythm so well, I didn t find the serenity I had played with the first couple of days, so I struggled with bogeys and birdies.&#8221;But the 32-year-old, who has been waiting for his third European Tour win since the 2012 Dubai Desert Classic, said he would be calm heading into the last day.&#8220;I ve been joint leader or leading by myself many times, looking for that third win,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So it s a very common position for me. I m just confident.&#8221;Brazel, the world number 480, shot 67 to become a challenger for what would be by far the biggest victory of his career. He said keeping his nerves in check would be key on Sunday.&#8211; Rose wilts &#8211;&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try and control the nerves better than I did&#8230; and just enjoy it, enjoy the atmosphere of it all and take it all in, it&#8217;s been fun,&#8221; he told reporters.Brazel, whose partner died suddenly from bacterial meningitis in 2009, said winning the Hong Kong Open would &#8220;mean the world&#8221; to him.Fleetwood said an eagle on the par-five 13th had got his &#8220;juices flowing&#8221; as he also aims to end a long win drought.The 25-year-old Englishman has not won on the European Tour since clinching the 2013 Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles.&#8220;I haven&#8217;t won for a long time, I had a year out of the game really &#8212; I was playing dreadful from mid-2015 to mid-this year &#8212; so I&#8217;ve sort of being on a path since August getting my game back,&#8221; he said.Last year&#8217;s winner Justin Rose admitted he had &#8220;no prospects&#8221; of victory as he shot 70 to lie one-under for the tournament, where he is struggling to recover from a back injury.Elsewhere, US Masters champion Danny Willett was six off the lead after a forgettable round of 71 marked by four bogeys on the back nine.Fellow Englishman David Howell equalled the course record of 63 to lie four shots back from the leaders in a tie for fifth place.AFP
