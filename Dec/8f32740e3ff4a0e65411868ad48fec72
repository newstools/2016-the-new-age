Early recognition of acute coagulopathy can help reduce morbidity (sickness) and mortality, a University of KwaZulu Natal study has revealed.The research was conducted by the specialist general surgeon at the department of general surgery and lecturer, Dr Aslam Noorbhai.The study aimed to assess the prevalence of acute coagulopathy of trauma (ACoTS) at the level one trauma unit at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Durban and correlate it with injury severity and in-hospital mortality.ACoTS is often present in trauma patients, particularly those injured. Noorbhai said haemorrhagic shock is the leading cause of preventable early deaths from trauma.He said: Acute coagulopathy on admission to a trauma unit is associated with worse outcomes. The relationship of haemorrhage to early mortality remains consistent regardless of the mechanism of injury. Haemorrhage and haemorrhagic shock are increasingly amenable to interventions that result in reductions in morbidity and mortality. Noorbhai conducted a retrospective analysis of the first 1000 patients admitted to the trauma unit at the hospital between 2007 and 2011. Of the 1000 patients, 752 were male. There were 261 admissions directly from the scene and 739 inter-hospital transfers (non-scene).He correlated the admission international normalised ratios (INRs) with injury severity scores (ISSs) and in-hospital mortality.The study found a high prevalence of coagulopathy. Raised admission INRs were associated with worse outcomes, Noorbhai said.The study found that the overall prevalence of coagulopathy was comparable to previous studies and was high in both direct admissions and inter-hospital transfers.NOKUTHULA NTULI
