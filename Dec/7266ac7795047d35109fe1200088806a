There has been 684 fatal crashes in 20 days this month that have claimed a 845 lives.This is almost the same figure that was recorded this time last year.Transport Minister Dipuo Peters yesterday announced that the country had recorded 684 accidents since December 1.A total of 845 people have been killed on the roads countrywide. We are witnessing an unprecedented pattern during this festive season which largely contributes to the unacceptably high levels of crashes and fatalities with human factors contributing 82%, roads and environmental factors 10% and vehicle factors 8%, Peters said.She said corrupt officials were also a contributing factor to the growing number of fatalities.Some of the gaps that had been identified was the weakness in monitoring and enforcing the implementation of the 24/7 law enforcement operations. We have identified an emerging and disturbing trend where our enforcement officers are not hard at work enough on unroadworthy vehicles, by not discontinuing and impounding vehicles. Fatalities in KwaZulu-Natal had increased to 32, Limpopo to 28, Mpumalanga 26, North West 9, Gauteng 3, and Free State 2.A total of 3906 vehicles have been impounded countrywide.Peters said road fatalities cost the country an estimated R149bn annually. Unapologetically and steadfastly, I have deemed it necessary to urgently convene a meeting with all traffic chiefs and regional directors of provinces with high fatalities to engage and confront the prevailing situation with a view of finding solutions and interventions to reduce the carnage and fatalities, Peters said.-KUTULLO MADISHA
