The Western Cape High Court has on Friday dismissed suspended ANC Western Cape chairperson Marius Fransman&#8217;s bid to have his suspension overturned.The decision comes after Fransman last month sought a judicial review of the National Disciplinary commission&#8217;s decision to suspend him for 5 years after being found guilty on two counts of misconduct.On Friday the court said ANC&#8217;s constitution gave Fransman the power to approach the Appeals committee if he has objections to the Disciplinary Commission and Integrity committee&#8217;s findings.The court added that the application was ill conceived and premature as there was nothing to suggest that Fransman would not get a fair hearing within the party&#8217;s platforms.The court determined that a judicial intervention was not warranted in this case and dismissed Fransman&#8217;s plea with costs.Speaking to ANN7 on Friday the suspended chairman said he accepted the court&#8217;s decision that he should subject him self to the ANC&#8217;s internal appeals process but he remains concerned.&#8220;I believe the process up to now has been completely unfair but now lets wait and see if the appeals committee process will be fair and independent and not follow the line which we have previously seen,&#8221; said Fransman.He also asserted his innocence saying &#8220;I have never been found guilty by a court of law for any abuse, I have never been charged of any abuse so how is it possible while other leaders have also been accused did not face disciplinary steps which I did.&#8221;Last month Fransman was found guilty on two counts of misconduct abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand and for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute. Following his suspension Fransman hit out at party Secretary General Gwede Mantashe saying he was using his office for factional battles.-TNA Reporter
