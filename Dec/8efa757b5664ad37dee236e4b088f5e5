Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane and his Nigerian counterpart Dr Kayode Fayemi have endorsed a two-year Action Plan for the implementation of an MoU on cooperation in the fields of geology, mining, mineral processing and metallurgy.At a meeting in Abuja, Nigeria today, the Ministers agreed on a Plan to be implemented from January 2017 &#8211; that will focus on the following areas: advancing geo-scientific knowledge generation; contribution to energy security; contribution to agriculture and food security; the regulatory framework; mineral processing and value addition; as well as institutional capacity.This follows a commitment made by the Ministers during the State Visit to Nigeria earlier this year, where Presidents Jacob G. Zuma and Muhammad Buhari prioritised agriculture, energy and mining for the economic development of the two countries. The Ministers agreed then to implement the MoU, which had been signed in 2013, but had not been ratified until then. With the implementation of this Action Plan, we will be able to better advance and ensure benefit to both countries from the development of our respective mining value chains, in line with our respective national priority programmes, which include diversification of the economy, job creation, energy security and industrialisation Minister Zwane said.The MoU outlines up to 10 areas of cooperation which include geology; regulatory framework and licensing; mineral processing; metallurgy; artisanal and small scale mining; investment promotion; and capacity building.The Ministers also agreed to jointly host a mining investment promotion conference in Nigeria during the second half of 2017.For further media enquiries, kindly contact Ayanda.Shezi@dmr.gov.za /Media@dmr.gov.zaEnds Issued by Department of Mineral Resources
