Possibly one of their most ambitious sports challenges to date, Nike revealed on Monday its plan to break the 2-hour marathon barrier with new project Breaking2.Inspired in part by Sir Roger Bannister, who not only broke a boundary of his own back in 1954 when he ran the first four-minute mile, but also for athletes everywhere, Nike&#8217;s new project aims to break not only another boundary but also demonstrate what the human body is capable of.With the current men&#8217;s world record time set at 2:02:57, the new aim would require knocking three percent off the existing time, which is equal to shaving seven seconds off each of the 26.2 miles of the marathon. Even for the world&#8217;s best runners this is a huge difference, and many consider it to be an impossible challenge.Nike however, doesn&#8217;t; instead the brand considers real failure to be not failing to break the record, but failing to try. Nike&#8217;s co-founder Bill Bowerman noted, &#8220;The real purpose of running isn&#8217;t to win a race, it&#8217;s to test the limits of the human heart;&#8221; the brand emphasized that the project is not just about running and setting a new sports record, but also about challenging the ideas of what is possible in sport and inspiring athletes around the world to push boundaries.The athletes pushing boundaries in the Breaking2 challenge have been chosen by Nike for their potential to break the record and also their fearless attitude to attempt it. The brand has chosen three individuals for the project: Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya, Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia and Zersenay Tadese of Eritrea, who next year will attempt to break the 2-hour marathon barrier and see if the seemingly impossible feat is in fact within reach.Along with the athletes, Nike is currently working with a team of experts from several fields of science and sport to look at biometrics, training, nutrition, environment, sports psychology and physiology, and of course product, to provide the trio with the very best and most up-to-date information, advice and equipment, analyzing every detail of the Breaking2 attempt, from weather conditions to what Nike jersey to wear.This research and development will also be used by Nike to debut new products and innovation to aid performance even further, not only for the Breaking2 marathon runners but for athletes all around the world.Those excited about the challenge will have to wait until next year for the date and location of the sub two-hour race attempt, but for now fans can follow the progress of Breaking2 on a dedicated website.-Relaxnews
