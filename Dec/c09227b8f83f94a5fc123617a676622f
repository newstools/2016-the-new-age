THE Coca-Cola Khaya Majola Week started in Bloemfontein yesterday with some of the nation s best young cricket players battling it out for honours. Former Proteas all-rounder Robin Peterson has been chosen to lead a panel of experts tasked with selecting the hero of the day award winners.Peterson said the tournament is the platform for future stars. Having played in the tournament myself I can testify that this tournament can be a significant stepping stone in the career of a young cricketer, Peterson said. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to play a part in the country s premier youth cricket tournament and to lead the judging panel, which has already uncovered great talent. He said the hero of the day award is not your typical man of the match award.The award, he said, can go to a fielder pulling off an amazing catch, a tail-ender smashing a six to win the match or even the player displaying true sportsmanship and embodying the spirit of the gentleman s game .It s moments such as these that Peterson and his team, made up of some of the foremost cricket experts in the country, including key members of the national sporting and school sports media, will look out for.Fetsi Mbele, Coca-Cola s senior communications manager, said the tournament is the primary platform for identifying the future representatives of South African cricket. It is therefore fitting to appoint an established hero who is also a graduate of the tournament to scout our future stars, Mbele said. At our company we are immensely proud to continue our support of the development of youth cricket in South Africa through this tournament and the T20 Schools Challenge-BECKER SEMELA
