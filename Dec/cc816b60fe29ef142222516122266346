MAMELODI West community in Tshwane have welcomed the opening of the Half Way House, to help recovering drug addicts to integrate better in the community.Up to 80% of households in Mamelodi East have a family member hooked on the dangerous and highly addictive drug nyaope. The centre was officially opened by Gauteng social development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza on Friday. This has led to many dysfunctional families in the community.The department has allocated a subsidy of R1.9m to the programme which is an outpatient non-medical component services for the 2016-17 financial year.Masello Lamola, 29, whose brother has been an addict for the last six years said she hoped the centre would bring change to the community. There have been many centres opening and closing down within a short period.I hope this will be functional and able to help people who are in need. It is obvious that as a community we are failing in preventing our children from engaging with drugs.So seeing the government involved is uplifting. Addressing about 200 community members who attended the ceremony, Mayathula-Khoza said it was important that the government, the private sector and the communities worked together to curb the scourge of substance abuse. We must all join hands because substance abuse in our communities is huge and many of those hooked on drugs cannot afford treatment. I am thankful for the partnership between the department of social development and the Second Chance Centre, she said.The province needs halfway houses to link service addicts with external resources and services in preparation for their reintegration into their families, communities and places of employment.If they are not provided with propern reintegration and aftercare services, they may easily relapse. Such programmes will help service users maintain a drug-free life on completion of their treatment programme. provinces@thenewage.co.za
