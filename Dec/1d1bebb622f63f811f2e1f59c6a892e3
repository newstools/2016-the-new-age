The majority of black South Africans will remain poor and unemployed because they have been edged out of big cities, a new research report by the Socio-Economic Rights Institute South Africa (Seri) says.The research report, released on Thursday, found that a significant part of existing unemployment in most of South Africa s cities can be explained by distance from work. Living closer to jobs seems to increase people s chances of finding employment, but well-located areas are unaffordable for the poor, it said. Peripheral location is therefore a type of poverty trap, as peripheral location, itself partly caused by poverty, makes poverty exit more difficult. It was found that unemployment is higher in areas located on the outskirts, particularly Orange Farm and Soshanguve, although they fall under big municipalities. Large rural areas in the east of Tshwane mean that the north-east of the Johannesburg Ekurhuleni-Tshwane region contains significant rural land, but it is nonetheless a very urban area as a whole. Similarly, with the case of Gauteng province, as a whole, unemployment rates are very low in central areas of Johannesburg, in Ekurhuleni s main urban areas and in a corridor which extends north-south between Johannesburg and Pretoria, However, it was found that semi- peripheral surrounding areas such as Soweto, Katlehong, Tembisa and Soshanguve have very high unemployment rates. Seri then suggests that opening up housing opportunities for the poor in existing well-located areas, close to jobs, could be a solution.It says more formal affordable accommodation needs to be developed in Johannesburg s inner city and likely the inner cities of other major metropolitan municipalities. Seri s view is that the large-scale provision of affordable rental accommodation must be publicly provided. It will be a key part of any kind of city densification strategy but the private market and social housing sector cannot provide rental housing on the scale needed for poor residents. -Dudu Dube
