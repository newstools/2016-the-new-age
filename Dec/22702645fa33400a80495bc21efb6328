Two people died in an accident on the N1 North in Hammanskraal on Tuesday .It is believed that the accident was caused by a bakkie that broke down in the slow lane.Five other people escaped the accident apparently unharmed.Emergency Management Services (EMS) said the bakkie s trailer broke down in the slow lane.&#8220;A horse and carriage came past the bakkie and I think the driver only realised once he was at the vehicle that the vehicle was not moving. He swerved but the back trailer caught the trailer of the bakkie and then the chaos of the accident. said EMS spokesperson Johan Pietersson.-TNA Reporter&nbsp;
