Legal representative for the Democratic Alliance(DA) Stephen Budlender on Monday told the North Gauteng High Court that it is Parliament which should be the one to decide whether South Africa withdraws from the International Criminal Court(ICC) and not the executive as in this case.&#8220;The debate isn&#8217;t if there is a power to withdraw but rather who the power is conferred on,&#8221; said Budlender.Budlender argued that there was nothing preventing the executive from tabling the idea of a ICC withdrawal in Parliament.Budlender also said that South Africa&#8217;s constitution does not speak to whether the country can withdraw from a treaty and thus does not say who is allowed to withdraw from a treaty on behalf of the Republic.&#8220;This power must be vested in Parliament and not the executive. This court must declare the decision by the executive to withdraw South Africa from the ICC unconstitutional,&#8221; Budlender continued.The North Gauteng court on Monday heard arguments in the Democratic Alliance&#8217;s(DA) application to halt South Africa&#8217;s withdrawal from the ICC.Last month the Constitutional Court dismissed the party&#8217;s application for direct access to the court to challenge the constitutionality of the decision.Budlender on Monday also stressed the importance of human rights and the constitutional duty to act if human rights violations take place saying &#8220;withdrawal from the ICC prevents that from happening.&#8221;He said the South African government has taken a layer of protection away from its citizens by its decision to withdraw from the ICC.The DA&#8217;s legal representative also added that the Implementation Act of the Rome Statute still stands and thus the South African government cannot simply withdraw.The case continues with the Minstry of International Relations, Minister of Justice and Correctional Affiars, the speaker of Parliament also featuring among the respondents in the case.-TNA Reporter
