Turkey&#8217;s president said Wednesday he would speak with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in an effort to rescue a ceasefire deal which would allow civilians and rebel fighters to be evacuated from Syria&#8217;s Aleppo.&#8220;I will speak with Mr Putin again later in the evening,&#8221; President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during a televised speech in Ankara. &#8220;The situation on the ground is very fragile and complicated.&#8221;Turkey, Russia and rebel groups on Tuesday confirmed an agreement had been reached for civilians and opposition fighters to leave Aleppo, Syria&#8217;s second city.If implemented, the deal would mark the end of opposition resistance in Syria&#8217;s second city after years of fighting and a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad.Deadly clashes erupted in Syria&#8217;s Aleppo on Wednesday, putting the deal for the evacuation of rebel areas on hold.Moscow, a key Assad ally that launched an air war in support of his forces last year, said the Syrian army resumed its operations in Aleppo after &#8220;an attack by the terrorists was warded off&#8221;.But Erdogan accused Assad&#8217;s forces of breaking the deal and attacking civilians.&#8220;We were hoping that a process of evacuation had begun for civilians and opposition from east Aleppo as a result of negotiations that I personally followed, unfortunately missiles have begun to be launched again,&#8221; the Turkish president said.&#8220;Therefore, we remain cautious,&#8221; he said, adding that the implementation of the ceasefire was the &#8220;last hope&#8221; for the people in Aleppo.Erdogan also hit back at the United Nations for its failure to create a safe zone inside Syria to shelter Syrian refugees and said Turkey would host those fleeing from Aleppo if necessary.&#8220;Hey the United Nations, where are you?&#8221; he said.Erdogan said Turkey finalised preparations for civilians to be evacuated from Aleppo to to the western Syrian city of Idlib near the Turkish border.&#8220;We are also ready to embrace those who will come to Turkey,&#8221; Erdogan said.Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Tuesday that Ankara would &#8220;set up a tent city to accommodate up to 80,000 Syrian refugees fleeing Aleppo&#8221;.-AFP
