One was rescued and the cause of the accident on Sunday was being investigated.Industrial safety standards are often flouted in China even though deadly incidents regularly make national news.China is the world&#8217;s largest coal producer and colliery accidents killed 931 people in 2014, according to official data.The government says fatalities are declining, but some rights groups argue the actual figures are significantly higher due to under-reporting.-AFP
