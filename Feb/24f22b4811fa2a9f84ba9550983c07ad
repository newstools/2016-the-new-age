Eskom has issued letters to seven Mpumalanga municipalities warning them to settle their bills by April, failing to do so the power utility will cut off the electricity supply.The Municipalities in the province currently owe Eskom a combined R1.4 billion on electricity, and Eskom has threatened to cut off the electricity supply.The province&#8217;s Premier David Mabuza said: The municipalities found themselves having an escalating debt due to interests on the arrears as well as on penalties, which suggested that they were incapable of selling electricity on behalf of Eskom. This is not working, municipalities in the province are not making any profit by selling electricity. People are stealing electricity and some are not paying at all, yet municipalities have to pay.If municipalities wanted to continue distributing electricity, they needed to consider finding alternative methods of consuming electricity, as they were incapable of managing the Eskom account, he said.Nkomazi, eMakhazeni, Mkhondo, Govan Mbeki, Lekwa, Thaba Chweu and Chief Albert Luthuli local municipalities will suffer the consequence of spending eight hours in the dark on a daily basis.Premier Mabuza said municipalities need to pay their outstanding amount, however they should review their agreement as it was a huge responsibility to manage.He said Eskom payment terms are onerous and untenable for the municipalities, and they need to be reviewed, otherwise they will have no option as a province but to pull out of the business arrangement with Eskom. We must negotiate the reasonable terms, failing which will result in the municipalities opting out because they do not have capacity to run the business of selling electricity, said Mabuza.Last week Eskom disconnected five Northern cape municipalities for a debt of just over R113 million due to the municipalities defaulting on existing payment terms and payment arrangements.The Supply was disconnected between 07:00 to 10:00 in the morning and 18:00 to 20:00 in the evening.Meanwhile, last year December Eskom had cut electricity in four Eastern Cape municipalities in arrears of more than R150m, the provinces Premier Phumullo Masualle and the provincial government intervened in the matter, which resulted in partial payment of the sum owed and a committed to a payment plan for the settlement of the remainder of the debt.In a statement Eskom said that it is legally bound by the Public Finance and Management Act (PFMA) to collect all revenue due to it and therefore they cannot allow debt levels to go unchecked.Last year, Eskom announced its plans to disconnect electricity in the top 20 defaulting municipalities across the country with effect from June, 5, 2015 and the R4,6 billion owed to Eskom by municipalities, the top 20 defaulting municipalities were indebted to Eskom to the amount of R3,68 billion.
