This year s 16 Days of Activism for no violence against women and children campaign will take a new approach to see the government participate in a series of dialogues with community members.The campaign will encourage South Africans to act for a safer society for women and children. The government is expected to convene national dialogues in all district municipalities to bring the scourge of violence against women and children to the fore.It is an opportunity for the community to share personal stories and find collective solutions to end the violence and abuse, Women Minister Susan Shabangu said.Shabangu said the dialogues would not only engage women, but men s organisations as well. Sessions will be held separately with women and men to allow them to participate more freely. They will then be brought together. We think it s important to bring the men because there s violence because of them but that s how we change the mindset, Shabangu said.The dialogues will include public education and awareness raising campaigns and initiatives to help the government to assess how the criminal justice system responds.The Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation will be standing strong against abuse during the campaign.According to the organisation, one in four women in South Africa is in an abusive relationship, while every six days a woman in the country is murdered by her intimate partner and every 25 seconds a woman or girl is raped.Steenkamp was a South African model. On Valentine s Day 2013, Steenkamp was killed by her boyfriend, Oscar Pistorius.NONDUMISO ZWANE nondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
