One of Kimberley s main tourist attractions, the flamingoes, have migrated from Kamfers Dam a wetland that depends on rainwater because of a three-year drought cycle, which has left empty dams in the region.The provincial tourism authority marketing communication s officer, Tebogo Velembo said the flamingoes come and go although there are some in the area but it all depends on the rainfall. We are in a three-year drought cycle and that is very worrying for the country as a whole. The Kamfers Dam water supply comes from a natural source, which is heavily dependent on rain. The flamingoes are migratory birds they go where they will have a food supply. As indicated, the water supply of the dam is from a natural source. We are hoping the rain will come soon so the flamingoes will return, Velembo said.Kamfers Dam, situated in the north of Kimberley, is one of only four sites on the continent where the African flamingo can be found in the Sol Plaatje local municipality. During wet spells there would be between 20 000 and 50 000 birds around the dam, and sometimes even more. However, several factors, including the drought, have led to the usual sight of a wave of pink disappearing from alongside the N12 as motorists enter Kimberley.But Velembe says the flamingoes are migratory birds that will go where they have a food supply. Last year the Water and Sanitation Minister, Nomvula Mokonyane warned that South Africa is a water-scarce country with highly-variable rainfall and water runoff.Mokonyane said the dire water-shortage situation needed pro-active and responsive risk management, coupled with innovative water security management interventions. Climate change has exacerbated the situation and thus numerous parts of South Africa have, for a few years, been experiencing below-average rainfall.Velembo concurred with the minister s statement, saying tourism in general gets affected by drought and all natural attractions globally were affected by drought, including the popular pink birds, one of the major tourist attractions in the area.provinces@thenewage.co.za
