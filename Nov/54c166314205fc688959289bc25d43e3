Black Friday razzmatazz hits shopping centres countrywide on Friday, and it s likely to be crowded.All local supermarket giants are promising amazing deals both online and in-store, plus a massive turnout by shoppers looking for great bonanza deals is highly anticipated. More shoppers than last year are expected.Black Friday is also regarded globally as the official start of the Christmas shopping season.Last year, there was chaos with some customers waking up in the wee hours of the morning before doors opened in order to get their hands on the bargains first.Mention of Black Friday among South African social media users leapt by more than 300% last year compared to 2014, with Checkers, DionWired and Pick n Pay ranking as the most talked-about brands on the day.Data collected from the Social Studio media monitoring platform that was analysed by digital customer engagement agency, 25AM, reveals that there were more than 18 000 South Africans mentioning Black Friday on tracked social media platforms on November 26 and 27, 2015.In 2014, South Africa only generated about 6 000 mentions of Black Friday, and this year the number is expected to quadruple.Checkers, one of the first major retailers in South Africa to push the concept of Black Friday with its 2014 promotions, emerged as the big winner on social media.A number of retail supermarkets expect big crowds in this year s Black Friday shopping bonanza, but the big question remains whether consumers will still carry on spending during Christmas holidays given the financial state of consumers and weak economic growth.Some commentators said this was a once-off opportunity for struggling consumers.Sage, specialists in accounting and business management software development, said shoppers are adventurous on Black Friday, as a result supermarkets have an opportunity to attract new customers or get customers to buy goods from them that they usually get somewhere else.Adrian Naud , group executive of marketing at Pick n Pay, said: We had an incredible trading day last year on Black Friday and this year, we are once again fully gearing up for a fantastic day. Checkers said: This is our biggest Black Friday yet, with 40% more products on offer than last year.&#8221; In 2015, we served more than a million customers on the day and sold enough Coca-Cola to fill more than three Olympic-sized swimming pools.
