German Chancellor Angela Merkel Wednesday told US president-elect Donald Trump that any &#8220;close cooperation&#8221; between the two countries must be based on shared democratic values, and reminded him of the global responsibility he carries.&#8220;Germany and America share the values of democracy, freedom, respect for the rule of law and human dignity, regardless of origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political belief,&#8221; said Merkel.&#8220;On the basis of these values, I offer close cooperation to the future president of the United States of America, Donald Trump,&#8221; she said to the election winner whose campaign was littered with sexist and anti-migrant slurs.Merkel also pointed to the global challenges Trump must tackle, saying that &#8220;whoever rules this country, with its tremendous economic might, military power and cultural impact, carries a responsibility that can be felt almost anywhere on Earth&#8221;.She stressed that &#8220;the partnership with the USA is and will remain the foundation of German foreign policy so that we can meet the great challenges of our times&#8221;.These included, she said, &#8220;the pursuit of economic and social prosperity, the struggle for forward-looking climate policy, the war on terrorism, poverty, hunger and disease, the pursuit of peace and freedom, in Germany, Europe and the world&#8221;.On the campaign trail, Trump has accused Merkel of &#8220;ruining Germany&#8221; with her open-door policy to refugees but later also called her &#8220;a really great world leader&#8221;.Despite the past slights &#8212; and obvious policy differences on climate change, free trade and a host of other issues &#8212; Merkel stressed that, for Germany, there is &#8220;no country outside the European Union with which we have deeper ties than with the United States&#8221;.Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned Wednesday that US foreign policy would become more unpredictable after Trump was elected president, making things &#8220;more difficult&#8221;.&#8220;In other words, and I will not dress it up, nothing will become easier, many things will become more difficult,&#8221; said Steinmeier, who had during the US campaign compared Trump to a &#8220;hate preacher&#8221; and also described the prospect of him taking the White House as &#8220;frightening&#8221;.-AFP
