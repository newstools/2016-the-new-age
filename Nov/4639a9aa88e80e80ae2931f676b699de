An amount of R92m has been set aside by the provincial department of public works, roads and transport to construct the D236 Road in the Barberton area outside Mbombela.The 18-month project on the 14km road is set to be completed in February 2018. The announcement was made by MEC Sasekani Manzini at a sod turning ceremony this week.Manzini said the provincial government wanted to deliver quality roads to its citizens but was concerned because of people damaging the roads through the burning of tyres during service delivery and other protests.Manzini said the construction of the road followed several community protests over poor roads in the Barberton area. The local traditional authorities had also approached the department for intervention. About three years ago, the local chief approached the department on behalf of his people. This was after the people were mobilising a protest about this road. But the government did commit three years ago that with resources permitting, this road would be prioritised. So we are today delivering on that commitment, Manzini said.The commitment by the department has received applause from the local traditional authorities. Our people will now be able to start new small businesses because with the new road, travelling will be faster and cheaper. We would like to thank the department for its commitment regarding the construction of the road, chief Kenneth Nkosi said.francen@thenewage.co.za
