LAST year, after a seven-year separation, DJ Tira and DJ Sox, better known as Durban s Finest, put their differences aside and committed to working on an album.The result is Durban s Finest Reloaded, which recently hit the shelves. Speaking to The New Age, a re-energisedDJ Sox, real name Mbuso Sokhela, thanked the brand s loyal fans who, over the years, have been calling for the two friends to release music as a unit after going their separate ways. Look, the Durban s Finest brand is bigger than me. It is bigger than Tira. Through Durban s Finest, we have managed to build careers not only for ourselves but for the many other artists, singers, and dancers who have since emerged in Durban.The movement has been one of the biggest in Durban and we thank our fans for that, Sox said. With the release of their 28-track double-disc offering, the two stars have been promoting the album alongside other releases from Afrotainment Entertainment.They recently invaded Ladysmith as part of the Afrotainment Album Launch Picnic at the Ezakheni Park, just outside Ladysmith, KZN.DJ Sox says the double-disc offering is made up of mellow and mature house grooves accompanied by a good balance of Durban dance music also known as iGqom . What I bring to the Durban s Finest brand is a mature sound. Tira has made the Durban dance sound his signature, while I keep things on the deep and vocal house side of things, he said.Music has always been part of DJ Sox s life growing up. He started playing vinyl at the age of 16 and subsequently fell in love with the art of DJ-ing while watching Technics world championships tapes, which his mother bought for him.His passion for music created tension between himself and his mother because he started throwing mad house parties at her house when she was away as she travelled frequently. The constant parties led him to the mainstream Durban club culture, where he eventually met his partner, DJ Tira.siyabongas@thenewage.co.zaSIYABONGA SITHOLE&nbsp;
