With more than two million people in South Africa believed to be living with diabetes, knowing what to look out for could help reduce the effects of the disease.As November marks National Diabetes Month, South Africans are encouraged to get screened for the condition, to reduce the risk of complications.One in two adults with diabetes are undiagnosed and the disease is often referred to as the invisible disease. Pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) said it was much easier to recognise when one knew what to look out for.To help with making the screening process easier, BI will be joining healthcare providers including the Independent Practitioners Association Foundation and Society for Metabolism, Endocrinology and Diabetes SA, in working with medical practitioners around the country to provide blood glucose screening, free of charge, to the public on World Diabetes Day on Monday.Medical director of BI South Africa Shanil Naidoo said: Management of diabetes and its complications begin in primary healthcare, that is, with your GP or local clinic. If you are diagnosed as diabetic, you should undergo eye screening for retinopathy once a year. Eye checks are included in the diabetes treatment guidelines for both private GPs and clinics and patients should ask for one if the healthcare provider does not suggest it. Diabetic retinopathy which leads to blindness is the most common eye condition among diabetics. However, this is avoidable in many cases because the risk can be reduced.Diabetes is characterised by increased blood sugar levels because of not producing enough insulin or because the body does not respond properly to insulin.The International Diabetes Federation Africa said there were 2.28 million cases of diabetes in the country last year.It is estimated that 415 million people have diabetes in the world and more than 14 million in the African region. 701793-TNA Reporter
