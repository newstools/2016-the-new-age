Struggling Free State Stars have signed experienced defender Rooi Ramahutsa in a bid to tighten their defence, having already conceded 11 goals in 10 games. As a result, the Bethlehem side are rooted at the foot of the table with five points and yet to score a victory.They were clearly exposed by Cape Town City who smashed in four goals against Ea Lla Koto in the Telkom Knockout semifinals in the Cape Town Stadium at the weekend. With Ramahutsa coming on board, Stars coach Giovanni Solinas will hope the 35 year old s experience will stabilise the team.The Mpumalanga-born defender boasts massive experience, having formed part of the Orlando Pirates team that won the back to back treble. Stars general manager Rantsie Mokoena has confirmed the capture of the former Witbank Spurs central defender. With Stars missing inspirational captain Paulus Masehe and defender Angelo Kerspuy owing to injury and suspension, Ramahutsa could be fast tracked to make his debut against Platinum Stars at Goble Park today.Meanwhile, new Pirates signing Nkosinathi Mthiyane is gearing himself for his debut. Since signing from Chippa United in the off season, the leftfooted player is yet to feature for Pirates, having suffered a muscle strain in training. Mthiyane is ready to fight for the jersey on the left wing against Thabo Matlaba and Amigo Memela. He is a former National First Division golden boot winner for Thanda Royal Zulu.Those scoring heroics earned him a move to AmaZulu who were campaigning in the PSL at the time. Meanwhile, Luyolo Nomandela has surfaced at Ajax Cape Town where he hopes to revive his career. Since moving to Mamelodi Sundowns three seasons ago, the attacking midfielder hasn t reproduced the magic he showed at Free State Stars. Loan stints at Moroka Swallows and Jomo Cosmos did not bring the best out of him.news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Xamba
