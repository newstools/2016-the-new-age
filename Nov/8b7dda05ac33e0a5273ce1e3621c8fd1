Sick people arriving at the ZF Mathews Hospital in Barkly West yesterday said they were turned back by the institution because of the continuing strike by staff.The hospital, which services areas including Delpoorthoop, Windsorton, Longlands, Barkly West and Gong-gong village, was shut down by protesters. The National Health, Education and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) rallied its members from the hospital and surrounding clinics and urged them to take part in the strike.As early as 6am, community members arrived at the hospital, only to be told there was no staff to service them. A heavily pregnant Caroline Pringle, 27, was one of the four pregnant women sitting outside the hospital.Pringle and the three other women were told there were no nurses to assist them and were turned back. The four women came to the hospital from the small town of Stilwater, which is situated 30km outside of Barkly West.The women said that because Stilwater has no clinics, they were forced to use the passenger transport belonging to the hospital.Pringle said she arrived there at 6.30am and had been waiting up until 12pm for the transport to take her home.However, patients in the hospital s theatre said they received their medication on time, were fed and that everything was functioning as normal.Betty Geyers, 45, said she arrived at the hospital the night before and had to postpone her X-ray because there were no nurses.Geyers said she was awake the whole night and lay on one of the benches of the hospital. I am tired, I want to go home, she said.Geyers travelled from Delpoorthoop, a town situated 100km from Barkly West. I am really upset and I don t understand why they had to keep me here so long, she said.Meanwhile, ambulances were seen bringing patients into the hospital despite the lack of staff.The dustbins of the hospital were overflowing and patients said the situation had been that way since the strike began in the early morning hours. The health department managed to beef up security at the gate but people entering the health facility were not searched.Provincial health spokesperson Lebogang Majaha said the department would continue to improve security while discussions between Nehawu and the department took place. We will continue to beef-up extra security personnel at each facility, according to the MEC s commitment to ensure the safety of our patients as well as the staff going to work daily, he said.Branch secretary of the Barkly West unitary branch Mbulelo Williams said they would continue with the demonstrations following the outcome of the court interdict that forced them to demonstrate within set parameters. The interdict stopped us from protesting and now we are reviving our workers and we will continue to down tools until they listen to us, he said.Williams said there would be no clinic or healthcare facilities operating until their demands were met. We cannot have the needs of the people trampled on while the Premier and his MEC protect one person (head of department Liz Botes). Botes has been accused of parachuting social development staff into senior positions at the health department and Nehawu wants her fired.nomusam@thenewage.co.za
