South Africa s decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court was not solely based on the Omar al Bashir matter but on the court s double standards, Justice Minister Michael Masutha said in response to a newly lodged court application to stop South Africa s withdrawal from the court. Several members of the Security Council of the UN are not member states of the ICC. They have preserved their own immunity against any recourse against them under the Rome Statute. Yet, the Security Council refers other non-member states of the ICC to it for prosecutions. These double standards are not to be tolerated, Masutha said.Last week, the Constitutional Court dismissed a similar application by the DA and now the party, together with lobby group Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution, have lodged another application in the North Gauteng high Court.Yesterday, Masutha filed his response where he argues this application to the court itself does not respect the separation of powers under the Constitution. The government contends that the application is misconceived in contending that the notice of withdrawal from the ICC is invalid because Parliament is being circumvented. That is not so. The approval of Parliament is being sought. The decision to withdraw from the ICC was announced early last month amid a pending appeal application against an order by the high court, which said South Africa should have arrested Sudan president Omar al-Bashir when he visited Johannesburg last year.Masutha has since published the Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act Repeal Bill aimed at ending the ICC s authority over South Africa. South Africa has raised these issues with the ICC. The suggestion that the decision to withdraw relates solely to the visit last year to South Africa of the Sudanese president is demonstrably untrue, he said.The matter will be heard next month.DUDU DUBEdudud@thenewage.co.za
