Australia captain Steven Smith said he was embarrassed by his team&#8217;s performance against South Africa and accused his players of lacking pride in their wickets after another batting collapse paved the way to a crushing 2-0 series defeat.Having resumed on 121 for two on day four in Hobart, Australia lost eight wickets for 40 runs before lunch to crumble to an innings and 80-run loss, the team&#8217;s fifth successive defeat in tests.Australia head to Adelaide for the series finale under lights next week with confidence at rock-bottom and pundits demanding wholesale changes to the team&#8217;s roster and staff.While giving credit to South Africa&#8217;s outstanding pace attack, Smith offered no defence for the struggles of his players and instead slammed them for failing to live up to the demands of international cricket.&#8220;It&#8217;s not working. Obviously on the back of five losses there&#8217;s going to be a lot talked about in regards to selection and things like that,&#8221; he said at a candid post-match media conference.&#8220;We&#8217;re not digging in enough, we&#8217;re not having the pride in our wicket &#8230; Something&#8217;s got to change and we&#8217;ve got to play a lot better than we have been if we&#8217;re going to beat any opposition around the world at the moment.&#8220;I need players that are willing to get in the contest and get in the battle and have some pride in playing for Australia and pride in the baggy green (cap).&#8220;I&#8217;m quite sick of saying it. We&#8217;ve lost five times in a row and for an Australian cricket team that&#8217;s humiliating and I&#8217;m embarrassed to be sitting here in this position, to be honest with you.&#8221;After being trounced by 177 runs in Perth, Australia brought a re-tooled lineup to Hobart, with Joe Burns replacing injured opener Shaun Marsh and specialist number six batsman Callum Ferguson debuting in place of all-rounder Mitchell Marsh.Burns scored one and a duck, while Ferguson scored one in the second innings and ran himself out for three in the first.Seamer Joe Mennie, who replaced injured paceman Peter Siddle, took 1-85 and rarely threatened.Smith said it was inevitable that selections would be under the microscope but he offered a bleak prognosis of the available reserves.&#8220;We need guys in state cricket to really step and jump out of the pack. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone really doing that at the moment, that&#8217;s really averaging 55-60, things like that,&#8221; he said.&#8220;So there&#8217;s obviously going to be questions asked in all different ways.&#8221;Smith said his bowlers also needed to lift, berating them for lacking discipline and giving the South Africa batsmen &#8220;freebies&#8221; with loose deliveries in each over.But they would at least be rested before Adelaide, in contrast to the batsmen, who faced a week of toil for their Sheffield Shield sides.&#8220;(Have them) try and spend some time out in the middle and score some runs,&#8221; he said.&#8220;It&#8217;s not happening at the moment so we&#8217;ve got to find a way to get better and concentrate on some of the things that I&#8217;ve talked about.&#8221;&#8211;Reuters
