With only 2% of service delivery protests recorded in the Free State in a time when the country is experiencing protests almost daily, the conclusion can only be that delivery is functioning in the province.The statistic does reveal though that there is dissatisfaction in some regions which the provincial government says it is determined to address.According to Municipal IQ s recently released municipal hot spots monitor report, the highest number of service delivery protests took place in Gauteng at 30%, followed by the Eastern Cape at 22% and KwaZulu-Natal at 16%.The other provinces recorded between 5% and 8%.However, some Free State residents who spoke to The New Age said the percentage was not representative of the level of dissatisfaction in the province.Moseki Matobako from Botshabelo said it was often pointless to protest because change never really came. People often protest but the solutions are temporary, so I think that people get tired of going to the streets, Matobako said.Municipal IQ is a specialised local government data and intelligence organisation that collects data on service delivery protests staged against municipalities in order to quantify and better understand the ongoing nature and trends behind such events.Municipal IQ said it was important to note that the provinces that had the highest number of protests also recorded political change during the local government elections in August. It is pertinent that Gauteng and the Eastern Cape continue to account for the greatest portion of protest activity in 2016 and were also subject to significant shifts in political representation in local polls last month, Municipal IQ managing director Kevin Allan said.By August, a total of 107 protests had already been recorded while at the same time last year the figure was standing at 164 and the year before that at 191. In 2013 protests recorded by August were 155 while in 2012 the figure was 173 and 82 in 2011.The organisation said the figures did not include protests against councillor candidates which have featured significantly this year, but also appear to have also somewhat retreated from a mid-year high.However, the figures showed that as of the end of August, major service delivery protests in 2016 were within a more consistent range of recent records.Service delivery protests as of the end of August 2015 were in fact marginally higher than they were at the end of August this year, notwithstanding a rash of protest activity earlier this year, which peaked in April 2016.KAMOGELO SEEKOEIkamogelos@thenewage.co.za
