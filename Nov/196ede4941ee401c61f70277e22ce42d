The Gauteng government is to spend R250bn to hasten radical socio-economic transformation in the province.This emerged in finance MEC Barbara Creecy s medium-term budget policy statement and the 2016-17 adjustment budget in the Gauteng provincial legislature yesterday.She outlined the provinces s approach to fund provincial priorities as reflected in Premier David Makhura s programme of radical transformation, modernisation and re-industrialisation.Education will spend about R128.7bn in the next three years. This will finance 2.3 million pupils in the public schooling system. This comprises 1.2 million pupils at no-fee schools, 42000 pupils in special schools and 141000 Grade R pupils, she said.In order to further improve the delivery of comprehensive health services, the health department will receive R127.2bn over the next three years.Creecy said the third key area of priority in the government s expenditure was infrastructure development to improve service delivery and create much-needed jobs, in conjunction with the private sector. In this regard the Gauteng Infrastructure Financing Agency will over the 2017 medium term expenditure framework period have a project pipeline with a potential to raise more than R40bn to support the provincial infrastructure master plan, Creecy said.She said the Gauteng provincial government commitment to clean government was underlined by significant improvement in the 2015-16 audit outcomes. Our war on waste is succeeding. Last year we drastically reduced fruitless and wasteful expenditure, including interest paid on overdue accounts and litigation settlements by 93%f from R415m the previous year to R29m last year. A significant saving of R386m. We have also managed to intensify cost containment measures and over the past two budget cycles of working with our departments, we have diverted almost half a billion from non-core spending towards our priority programmes.
