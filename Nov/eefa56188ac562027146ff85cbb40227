The Kremlin said Tuesday that President Vladimir Putin enjoys good relations with Francois Fillon, the surprise winner of the first round of France&#8217;s rightwing presidential primary.&#8220;They established relations when Putin was still head of government, they had quite extensive exchanges,&#8221; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.&#8220;They do indeed maintain quite good relations.&#8221;Peskov added that Moscow was following the French presidential primaries with &#8220;great attention.&#8221;&#8220;France is our partner, a country with which Russia maintains good relations and with which the scope of cooperation could be much larger than it is now,&#8221; Peskov added.Former prime minister Fillon, an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, pulled off a stunning upset on Sunday, knocking his former boss Nicolas Sarkozy out of the race and beating the favourite, fellow ex-premier Alain Juppe.Russian media this week portrayed Fillon as a &#8220;friend of Moscow&#8221; capable of mending relations that soured over Russia&#8217;s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its support of a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine.Business daily Vedomosti wrote Fillon was France&#8217;s &#8220;pro-Russian&#8221; presidential candidate, while online news portal Gazeta.ru said he was a &#8220;French remake of Donald Trump.&#8221;Fillon has called for closer ties with Russia and voiced support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s regime.Fillon will go head-to-head with Juppe in a run-off Sunday that is widely expected to decide France&#8217;s next leader after a prospective duel next year with far-right leader Marine Le Pen.-AFP
