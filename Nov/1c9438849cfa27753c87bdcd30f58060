Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has denied that she laid a criminal charge against her predecessor Thuli Madonsela.Mkhwebane said she has opened a case to determine whether a series of leaked material coming out of the Public Protector&#8217;s Office amount to a breach of the Public Protector Act.The statement by the Office of the Public Protector follows media reports which emerged on Sunday claiming that a criminal charge had been laid by Mkhwebane against Madonsela following a complaint by President Jacob Zuma about the release of audio from his interview with Madonsela.However the Public Protector&#8217;s Office on Monday said the charge is not a criminal charge against Madonsela.&#8220;Adv. Mkhwebane is concerned that these alleged leakages of evidence could compromise the trust that the public has in her office. It is this concern that led to her opening a case for investigation,&#8221; reads a statement issued by the Public Protector.The Public Protector&#8217;s office details a number of purported leaks coming out of her office all which have to do with interviews Thuli Madonsela conducted because of her state capture investigation.&#8220;The decision to open a case was informed by complaints from the Presidency and the Office of the Speaker of the National Assembly. In addition to these, Adv. Mkhwebane received a media enquiry from Noseweek magazine, in which the publication claimed to be in possession of a recording of her predecessor s meeting with Ms Mentor, also relating to the State Capture investigation,&#8221; said the Public Protectors statement.According to the Public Protector there possibly is another leaked interview which features Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema. In order to maintain the credibility of the Public Protector South Africa and for the people to trust the institution we need to safeguard whatever evidence such people, including whistle-blowers, give to us, said Mkhwebane.Thuli Madonsela has previously admitted to giving the audiotape of her interview with President Zuma to news channel eNCA.Madonsela told news channel ANN7 that she made the decision to make public recordings of her interview with Zuma on state capture allegations, before she left office.She said this was not to try and prove that the state had been captured but to prove that she had given the President a chance to respond to the allegations. I was the Public Protector until the 14th of October this year, and as the public protector, I made a decision to make the report public, not as evidence of state capture, but as evidence that I did give the president a chance to respond. You will recall that by the 14th the president had already told the nation that he is taking me on application for an interdict, because I had not given him due process, said Madonsela.The presidency then asked Busi Mkhwebane to investigate the leaking of the audio recording. President Zuma has subsequently decided to take the State Capture report on Judicial review.&#8211;TNA Reporter
