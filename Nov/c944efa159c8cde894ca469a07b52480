A violence escalated at Tshwane University of Technology s (TUT) Soshanguve campuses, its management decided to freeze all face-to-face classes and tests for the safety of its more than 16000 students.The institution, which is due to start with final examinations in two weeks, has been badly affected by protests and violence since the #FeesMustFall protests flared throughout the country in September.Protests erupted after Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande announced that universities should decide on the 2017 fee increases and that students who have a maximum household income of R600000 would be exempt from the increases.Seven TUT students were suspended for their involvement in the #FeesMustFall protests.Earlier this week the Soshanguve Student Representative Council met with management to persuade them to lift the suspension of the seven students but the university refused.This sparked more protests which have now resulted in the closure of classes.TUT s vice-chancellor Prof Lourens van Staden said he was concerned by the ongoing disruptions at Soshanguve North and South campuses despite a public undertaking made by students to go back to class at the funeral of one of their peers who died after he was hit by a car during protests. There are 16244 students who have invested a great deal of time and money in their studies. These students should be allowed the opportunity to complete the 2016 academic year, he said.Van Staden said the executive council has decided to suspend face-to-face classes to protect students from further disruptions. The university remains steadfast in its decision to create an environment that will allow all our students to write their exams this year. Exams will commence on November 21 as previously communicated, he said.He urged students to use their MyTutor for important academic updates and information as well as exam updates. This decision will not affect the quality of teaching and learning at the Faculties of Humanities and ICT. Students should make the most of this time to prepare for the upcoming examinations, Van Staden said.Meanwhile, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has extended the study visas of foreign students to March 2017 as some were affected by the #FeesMustFall protests which went onfor more than a month at most universities.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
