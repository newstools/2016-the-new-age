 Less than 13% of Matjhabeng firms benefit from council s R2bn A whopping R2bn from Matjhabeng local municipality is said to be benefiting contractors from outside the authority.The municipal executive mayor Nkosinjani Speelman said he was working towards changing this trend to ensure that more contractors from within the municipality received work. I am not against people been given work but let s consider what the policy says and look at what happens on the ground. Less than 13% of companies from Matjhabeng are benefiting. And where are the black people? Speelman asked.He said the local airport was soon to be opened in the area. The airport is going to be opened but the contract has been given to someone and I am not happy about that. I don t have a problem with white people getting government contracts but you must understand that white people can t get all the businesses here. Black people must get contracts too, he said.Speelman said he would talk to te people who were in charge of the construction of the airport because he wanted them to help small businesses in Matjhabeng. The only way for local SMMEs to get to Grade 5 is to get work on big projects like these, he said. When you go to the mines, the people who supply eggs and chickens are from other provinces as if there are no people here. It can t be right. We can t allow this situation to happen. From Kroonstad to Masilonyana, all the companies that are used are from Johannesburg. Speelman said that he was not interested in wasting people s time, he wanted economic transformation. It is a must and we are not compromising. A company from Cape Town received a R19m contract for fencing a certain area and people who are painting the streets from Johannesburg got R16m. I am calling on you, the people of Matjhabeng, black and white, to help me solve this problem. Speelman promised to give the local community radio station The Rock FM R1m to support them and to buy them a vehicle.-GRACE BOLOWANA
