THE Gauteng government has declared some parts of the province disaster areas following recent flash floods which wreaked havoc last week.The provincial executive council s special meeting agreed that it be done in the wake of the death and destruction in Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni.At least seven people were killed. Everite Chauke, three, who is still missing, was swept away by the torrential rains and hundreds of people were left homeless.The OR Tambo International Airport was also severely impacted by the flash floods, leading to the suspension of services for several hours. With more extreme weather predicted over the next few months, there is a risk of negative impacts socially and economically.Production levels may be affected as people have to leave work early and the schooling programme and social services such as healthcare may be disrupted in areas where public property is damaged by extreme weather.Premier David Makhura will now issue a notice in the provincial government gazette declaring a state of disaster in the affected areas. The Gauteng provincial government will, in collaboration with the other spheres of government, take appropriate action to minimise the negative impacts of extreme weather, spokesperson Phumla Sekhonyane said. Residents who live in areas that are not suitable for human habitation, such as along the flood lines and river banks, will be relocated to safer areas, she said.Sekhonyane said the immediate concern of the provincial government is to assist in whatever way possible the needy and vulnerable who have been displaced as a result of serious damage to their homes.Gauteng MEC for health Qedani Mahlangu and MEC for social development Nandi Mayuthula-Khoza were on the ground in Ennerdale south of Johannesburg, after a tornado swept through the area on Monday. About 50 houses were damaged and 200 people affected.The MECs will ensure those in need receive the required support and assistance. Sekhonyane said the department of roads and transport would also conduct regular checks on all roads, bridges and other infrastructure to ensure that they function properly and are able to withstand any extreme weather. The department of health will activate the outbreak response unit to minimise the impact of a possible outbreak after tests confirmed the presence of e.coli bacteria in the Jukskei River water, she said.Sekhonyane said other departments would intervene as required to help reduce the negative impact of extreme weather. The Gauteng government is reviewing its disaster management strategy to strengthen existing capability to deal with disasters.The government thanked everyone who assisted those in need.
