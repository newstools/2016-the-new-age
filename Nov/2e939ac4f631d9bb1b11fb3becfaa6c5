Golden Arrows coach Clinton Larsen outplayed his old boss, Gordon Igesund, when his side handed Highlands Park a fourth defeat of the season at Makhulong Stadium yesterday. A second-half strike from Danny Phiri was enough for the KwaZulu-Natal side to see off the Lions of the North and move into second place on the Absa Premiership table with 17 points.Igesund coached the Arrows tactician when he was playing for Durban side Manning Rangers from 1992 to 1999. Larsen is one of the players who helped Igesund win his first league title in 1996 when he led the then unfashionable Rangers. Their paths crossed again at Orlando Pirates in 2000 and the two won their second league title together.Yesterday, they went up against each other in a battle for three crucial Absa Premiership points. Igesund was hoping for his first league victory since replacing Allan Freese last month, as he avoids a direct return to the National First Division. It looked like Igesund s wait would be over when his side gave the better performance in the first half.However, his players failed to penetrate Abafana Bes thende s well-organised defence, with goalkeeper Maximilian Mbaeva coming to the party as well. Players such as Mothobi Mvala and Edwin Sitayitayi had chances to score before half time while Arrows managed to keep the dangerous Collins Mbesuma at bay.In the second half, Arrows came back stronger with Lerato Lamola missing a one-on-one chance on 52 minutes with only Tapuwa Kapini to beat. Their hard work was rewarded with five minutes to go when Phiri capitalised on a long pass from Nkanyiso Cele. Highlands are two spots from the bottom of the log with six points from eight matches.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za&#8211;
