Sweden S Alex Noren was crowned Nedbank Golf Challenge champion at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City by posting a closing 63 to win by six shots for his fourth European Tour victory of the season yesterday.He carded an eagle, eight birdies and a solitary bogey to finish the week on 14 under par and as a result moved up to third in the Race to Dubai rankings this season which also saw him finish runner-up once and in the top 10 a further three times. Jeunghun Wang, who held a three-shot lead on Saturday night, finished six shots behind Noren in second, one stroke clear of Ricardo Gouveia, Alejandro Ca izares, Victor Dubuisson, South African Branden Grace and Andy Sullivan.Noren s countryman Henrik Stenson, who leads the Race to Dubai rankings fired a birdie at the last to finish eighth on six under. Englishman Danny Willett, winner of the 2014 Challenge, produced a 69 yesterday to finish on three under and keep in touch with Stenson ahead of next week s season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai.Willett, Noren and Northern Ireland s Rory McIlroy will do battle with Stenson at Jumeirah Golf Estates in a bid to win the Race to Dubai. Noren, who led at the halfway stage of the competition, began the day six shots off the lead but soon closed the gap courtesy of birdies at the first three holes and another gain at the fifth.Noren holed his 30-foot birdie putt at the seventh before repeating the trick from a similar distance at the next to move to 11 under. When Wang carded a disappointing double bogey at the eighth, Noren briefly found himself with a one-shot lead but the South Korean fired a birdie at the ninth to join him at the summit. Noren regained the lead at the 10th, however, effortlessly knocking in his 25-foot eagle putt before chipping in for a birdie.lindam@thenewage.co.za
