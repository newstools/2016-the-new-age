As the impact of climate change is becoming more evident, environmentalists have urged South Africa to work harder in fighting against climate change.The appeal comes as the countries including South Africa wrapped up the Climate Change International Conference (COP22) in Morocco.WWF South Africa s climate change programme manager, Jaco du Toit, said that focusing on renewable energy was critical. During the meetings in Marrakech, 50 countries in the Climate Vulnerable Forum pledged to achieve 100% renewable energy between 2030 and 2050. Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Madagascar and several other African states are included. The Africa Renewable Energy initiative also reported strong progress on setting up the infrastructure to deliver on its target of 300GW of new renewable energy by 2030, he said.He said that South Africa which had been negatively impacted by the ongoing drought should follow in the foot steps of other African countries. Any further expansion of carbon intensive infrastructure will make it impossible for South Africa to realise its international commitments and to do its part in keeping warming below 1.5 C especially considering that average temperatures during 2016 are already projected to be 1.2 C above pre-industrial levels, he said.July this year was recorded as the hottest month on record since records commenced in 1880.It is also predicated that 2016 is set to be the hottest year on record.He also spoke of a need to ensure finances were available for climate change projects. With another series of negotiations on African soil wrapped up it is becoming ever more urgent to scale up climate finance, particularly support for those already bearing climate change impacts. Progress on the national adaptation strategy must be maintained, he said. 701233
