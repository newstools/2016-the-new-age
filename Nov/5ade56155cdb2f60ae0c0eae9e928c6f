Four of the five suspects arrested for the massacre of the Mdletshe family in Hluhluwe have been released without being charged. However, the other accused will be charged. We ve confirmed that four suspects were released on Monday as there was no evidence against them. A 23-year-old suspect will appear tomorrow in the Mtubatuba Magistrate s Court, SAPS spokesperson Lt-Col Thulani Zwane said.Originally five suspects were arrested on Sunday following the brutal murder of Nyanyekile Gumede, Sifiso Nkosi and Thengabantu Gumede, who were hacked with a bush knife before being burnt to ashes in the early hours of Saturday morning at their homestead in Mudulini village. Two other members of the family who were also set alight managed to escape into nearby bushes.The suspects were alleged to be members of a neighbouring family who were in conflict with the massacred family over an incident that occurred more than two months ago, when a member of the suspect s family was allegedly stabbed in an altercation with a member of the Mdletshe family.A devastated Lindiwe Thwala, who lost an uncle, brother and mother to the attack, said the family had been under the impression that the matter had been resolved as they went to apologise and offered to pay for the medical treatment of the injured party. Their apology had been met with a cold response from the matriarch of the family. The mother of the family told us that she did not want our money and that she would set her attack dogs on us in revenge. As time went on and nothing happened we assumed that everything was fine until I received a phone call telling me that my family had been killed, Thwala said.The deceased members of the family are expected to be buried at the weekend and the surviving relatives have been moved to a safer area.Sibongiseni Maphumulosibongisenim@thenewage.co.za
