South Africa s top cop Gen Kgomotso Phahlane could be in hot water.The police watchdog has launched an investigation into allegations of defeating the ends of justice in a probe into how he could afford his R8m Pretoria mansion.Forensic investigator Paul O Sullivan reported Phahlane to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) in January this year. I was contacted by a colonel from the police who picked up allegations of kickbacks. I researched for about three to four months and found that something was indeed wrong. I believe the case is rock-solid. I then opened the docket with Ipid in January, he said.O Sullivan said Phahlane had a lot of questions to answer regarding his house.Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said the police watchdog was not in a position to comment yet. Claims have surfaced that Ipid would demand a statement from Phahlane regarding the probe related to him defeating the ends of justice. We are not in a position to comment at this stage without jeopardising our investigations. We take the death threats against our investigator seriously. We will be working hard to identify the source of such death threats, Dlamini said.Phahlane s spokesperson, Brig Mashadi Selepe, said the police respected the mandate of Ipid to investigate any member of the South African Police Service irrespective of rank. The acting national commissioner welcomes any investigation of any allegations and on the matter against him conducted within the confines of the law to enable the testing of any such allegations. It is unfortunate that such investigations or allegations are conducted through the media with the sole aim of causing harm and damage to the reputation and integrity of the acting national commissioner, she said.Phahlane is not the first top cop to be in trouble with the law. Former commissioner Riah Phiyega was suspended last year following the Marikana report.BATANDWA MALINGObatandwam@thenewage.co.za
