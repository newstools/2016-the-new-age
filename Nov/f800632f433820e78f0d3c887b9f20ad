Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande got under the skin of the EFF in Parliament by accusing one of its members of instigation.In the National Assembly yesterday, Nzimande was asked by EFF MP Moses Mbatha about food and transport allowances for students at technical vocational education and training colleges.Mbatha warned Nzimande if they didn t get their allowances on time, students at the TVET colleges could show their displeasure. This is instigation by the EFF. We are aware that this is what you want to do to the TVET colleges. Firstly, we are in discussions with all the stakeholders at TVET colleges to ensure we deal with all the problems we have, Nzimande said.The state was unable to pay transportation at TVET colleges because the number of students has increased substantially, he said.EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu tried to raise a point of order, saying Nzimande had cast aspersions on a member who had asked a legitimate question. But deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli gave him short shrift. Mbatha said. He s casting aspersions on my good self. I m speaking as an honourable man. I m not instigating. He too got little sympathy from Tsenoli who said Nzimande s response was a reply to a political question. Nzimande also told the chamber that the biggest challenges to tertiary education next year were related to funding and accommodation.He said he did not expect any registration challenges at TVET colleges. Asked about the financial situation of students who belong to the so-called missing middle, Nzimande said all those who come from families who earn up to R600000 will not pay any increase in fees. They are going to experience no-fee increases. DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
