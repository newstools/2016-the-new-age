Southampton manager Claude Puel will rotate his players to ensure fresh legs can help his side get past Arsenal in their League Cup quarter-final at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.Southampton, who lost 2-1 at Arsenal in the Premier League in September, return to London on the back of a 1-0 home win over Everton in the Premier League on Sunday.&#8220;I think it is difficult to play this game just after Everton, but it&#8217;s always a good opportunity to give game time for all the players and to keep every time a good physical level,&#8221; Puel told the club website (www.southamptonfc.com).&#8220;We can see this against Everton. It was a game with fantastic intensity and this is possible just because we can rotate every time and keep the players with good fitness.&#8221;Puel acknowledged Arsene Wenger&#8217;s team will not let Southampton have a cakewalk and he wants to ensure the team he fields is at the top of their fitness levels.&#8220;It&#8217;s an important game but it&#8217;s important also to consider and respect our philosophy,&#8221; the Frenchman added.&#8220;It&#8217;s not just for me, 11 players and experienced players, but to give opportunities also (to players) like (19-year-old midfielder Josh) Sims&#8230; to show their qualities.&#8220;It&#8217;s a balance between good results and to continue this work with Southampton and to develop different players and to give also game time for players without time in the Premier League.&#8221;-Reuters
