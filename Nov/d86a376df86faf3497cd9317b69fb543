The Auditor Generals pharmaceuticals audit has found that 63% of health institutions did not record patients&#8217; details and medicines dispensed.Auditor General (AG) has noted a shortage of pharmacists and pharmacist assistants which increases the workload of nurses leading to a negative impact on the quality of health care provided.The results were released in Pretoria by Auditor General Kimi Makwetu on Wednesday as he presented the outcomes of the critical service delivery auditThe Auditor General identified a number of practices ultimately leading to patients not receiving their prescribed medicines on time.&#8220;Many plans were developed but not implemented within the pharmaceutical sector and poor communication resulted in a misalignment of the pharmaceutical budget and the actual healthcare needs,&#8221; said Makwetu.According to Makwetu, provincial health departments overspent on their budgets as they budgeted incrementally based on historical information rather than on the health care needs of the uninsured.The Pharmaceuticals audit conducted by the Auditor General saw 109 health institutions and 10 medical depots being visited over the past two years.Makwetu cautioned against improper stock management at some medical depots which in some cases lead to loss of stock or pharmaceutical stock expiring at medical depots.&#8220;Pharmaceuticals were not stored at the required temperatures. However improvements were noted in the temperature controls at the Free State medical depot during the 2015-16 financial year-&#8221; said Makwetu&#8220;Pharmaceuticals were not arranged in an orderly manner and rotated properly to ensure that those that expire first were issued first. At some of the medical depots, district pharmacies, sub depots and health institutions the stock was inappropriately stored,&#8221; continued Makwetu.The AG&#8217;s report showed that late payment of suppliers was also identified as a problem in the healthcare supply chain.-TNA Reporter
