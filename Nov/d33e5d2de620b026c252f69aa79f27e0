The dollar slid against major rivals on Friday as investors took advantage of a minor pullback in U.S. bond yields from recent highs and a holiday-shortened week to consolidate gains that had propelled the currency to a nearly 14-year peak.Expectations of higher U.S. inflation and interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve have driven the greenback to a more than 6 percent gain in the last two months, its strongest showing over a similar period since early 2015.Most currency players expect the gains to continue. But the combination of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, the processing of corporate flows before the month-end and perceived risks looming for markets in the first half of December led some to cash in gains now.&#8220;The latest consolidation has many investors wondering if it&#8217;s time to sell dollars,&#8221; said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.&#8220;While there is no question that the dollar is getting ahead of reality and as tempting as it may be to pick a top, the latest pullback is small which means the better trade should be buying the dollar&#8217;s dips until Fed Chair Janet Yellen tells us otherwise.&#8221;In afternoon trading on Friday, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were up slightly from the previous session at 2.359 percent, but off from Thursday&#8217;s 16-month high of 2.417 percent. U.S. two-year yields slipped from a more than six-year high hit earlier in the session and were last at 1.130 percent. The step-back in yields drove a modest selloff in the dollar.In early afternoon trading, the dollar index fell 0.3 percent to 101.42 after hitting an almost 14-month peak the previous session. The index posted its largest one-day fall since early November.After hitting an 8-month high of 113.90 yen earlier, the dollar was down 0.2 percent against the yen at 113.11 yen, although it still ended the week with a 2 percent gain.The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.0601 after dropping to $1.0518 on Thursday, its lowest since March 2015.Emerging market equities and currencies, meanwhile, have been hit hard by the specter of a possible Fed rate hike and potential U.S. trade protectionism under President-elect Donald Trump.The Turkish lira slumped to a record low even after the country&#8217;s central bank raised interest rates for the first time in nearly three years on Thursday. The lira was hurt as European Union lawmakers called for a temporary halt to EU membership talks with Ankara.-Reuters&nbsp;
