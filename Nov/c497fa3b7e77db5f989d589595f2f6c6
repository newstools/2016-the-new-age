Transnet Freight Rail yesterday reported a steady rise in revenue profit of 1.2% to R32.6bn for the six month to September 30 as the company continues with its infrastructure investment programme despite the biting economic conditions.The increase in containers on rail confirms the success of the company s road-to-rail drive, while at the same time validating the inroads Transnet has made in grabbing market share for rail-friendly cargo.The company spent R9.4bn on its infrastructure investment programme despite the weak economy, taking overall spend on the market demand strategy over the past five years to R133bn.The bulk of the investment (R7.1bn) was on sustaining capital and the remainder on new infrastructure and equipment. The company s profits were dampened by R628m in price reprieves to some of its key customers in distress, thereby saving thousands of jobs.Job preservation is a key element of the company s mandate from its shareholder. According to the group, a focus on cost containment resulted in a below inflation increase of 2.3% in operating expenses to R18.7bn despite an 8.6% and 7.6% hike in electricity and personnel costs, respectively.Further, Transnet said in a statement that it has realised a R1.8bn saving in planned costs. Operationally, coal volumes increased to 45.2 million tons (mt) despite various operational challenges, including equipment failures, security challenges, community unrest, unfavourable weather conditions and adverse market conditions.Manganese export volumes went up 7.5% to 5.7mt from 5.3mt previously, as commodity prices in that sector began to recover.Transnet s efforts to diversify sources of external revenue are gradually bearing fruit, with Transnet Engineering recording a 13.7% increase in external revenue to R688m from R605m in 2015, including sales to the rest of Africa.TNA REPORTER | business@thenewage.co.za
