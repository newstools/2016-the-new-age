Kylie Jenner has finally launched her beauty collaboration with big sister Khloe Kardashian and as expected, it sold out almost instantly.The limited-edition &#8216;Koko Kollection&#8217; set went on sale on the Jenner&#8217;s Kylie Cosmetics website on Wednesday afternoon, but was gone after a matter of hours. The teen beauty entrepreneur has since taken to Instagram to promise fans that stocks will be replenished soon.The set includes three matte liquid lipsticks and one lip gloss in the new shades of &#8216;Okurrr&#8217;, described as a &#8216;vibrant fuchsia&#8217;, &#8216;Gorg&#8217;, a red burgundy hue, and &#8216;Khlo$&#8217; a &#8216;cool yellow nude&#8217;. The shimmery gloss, a peachy pink shade which features vitamin E and emollient ingredients to moisturize the lips, is called &#8216;Damn Gina&#8217;. All the colors come packaged in metallic gold tubes, featuring the star&#8217;s signature dripping logo.Sisterly collaborations are nothing new for Jenner, who has teamed up with her supermodel sister Kendall on multiple projects spanning clothing lines, accessories and even books. But although she has named some of her famous lip kit products after family members, this is the first time she has partnered with a family member under the umbrella of her booming cosmetics brand.Jenner made her first move on the beauty industry in November last year, launching a series of &#8216;Lip Kit by Kylie&#8217; liquid lip colors that became an instant cult makeup product. She has grown the business rapidly, launching the product in multiple shades, alongside lip glosses, &#8216;Kyshadow&#8217; palettes and &#8216;Kyliners&#8217;. Earlier this week she hinted at plans to open the brand&#8217;s first bricks-and-mortar store.-AFP
