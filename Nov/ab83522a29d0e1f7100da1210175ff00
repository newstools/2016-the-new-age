Never ever the next thing you want the money tmro I don&#8217;t need it @sunetteviljoen RSA Min of Sport (@MbalulaFikile) November 7, 2016This was over the R70 000 she was supposed to receive in addition to the R200 000 she would get for winning silver at the Rio Olympics.This is the EXACT reason. No support whatsoever from sports administration. So unlike other countries. We finance ourselves. https://t.co/x945C2wNYa Sunette Viljoen (@Sunette_Viljoen) November 7, 2016This is the EXACT reason.

Always doing it on my own. pic.twitter.com/NFmSIqzgyD Sunette Viljoen (@Sunette_Viljoen) November 7, 2016Mbalula promptly responded that the medalist said she does not need the money.Am throughly abused by @sunetteviljoen and her girlfriend day and night RSA Min of Sport (@MbalulaFikile) November 7, 2016She had lashed out at the manner in which the sports administration had been treating athletes before, alleging in a tweet that she even had to pay for her own expenses while preparing for the Games in Rio.What I promised was a top up on that to show appreciation and recognize excellence. This Sunnette demanded before it was even promised.
