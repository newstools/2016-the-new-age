The City of Cape Town has a scheduled water shutdown in Dunoon on Thursday.This is due to the emergency repairs being done on a serious leak on a water main. The installation of the new equipment promises to improve the water supply in the area.Dunoon has been experiencing problems with their water pressure system and the new equipment is also expected to address the water pressure problem the area has been facing.According to City spokesman Farouk Robertson the City has arranged for water tankers to be deployed at different areas in Dunoon during the shut-off between 08:30 and 16:00.Robertson urged the residents to make sure their taps are properly closed.&#8220;Residents must please ensure that their taps are in the closed position to prevent water wastage or water damage when supply is restored&#8221;, he said.&#8220;The City apologies for the inconvenience caused and thanks residents for their understanding&#8221;, Robertson said.Meanwhile The City of Johannesburg not tighten the screws on water usage like Ekurhuleni and Tshwane, but maintain its Level 2 water restrictions instead.Ekurhuleni embarked on Level 3 water restrictions involving cutting off the water supply between 9pm and 5am while Tshwane is going the same route in its northern suburbs.Johannesburg MMC for environment and infrastructure services Anthony Still said that it is better to keep a continuous supply in the system. It is much better from an engineering point of view to keep a continuous supply in the system as this minimises bursts caused by water pressure, Still said.In the case of Alexander Park the cause was excess demand causing the reservoir to run dry and difficulty in recovering the balance.Johannesburg Water has recovered supply but appealed to residents to curtail demand.-TNA Reporter
