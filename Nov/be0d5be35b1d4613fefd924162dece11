We have 6 370km of tarred roads to maintain in the Free State and it can cost up to R25m to build 1km of new tarred road.The maintenance of roads linking towns plays a very important role in the farming communities as there are major role players in the economy and the mainstay of economic growth in the province, Mophethe said.On the same day the department will also have a sod turning event for the Hoopstad-Builtfontein road. The rehabilitation of HoopstadBuiltfontein road commenced on October 1 and was expected to be completed by June 2018.This project is anticipated to create 758 jobs and progress on the project is at 5%.In addition, 329 local residents were employed on the project including 218 youths, two disabled persons, 65 males and 20 females.
