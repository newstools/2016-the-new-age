A total of R238bn was lost to the economy last year as a result of violence against children.The staggering figure was released yesterday during the launch of the report by children s rights group Save the Children South Africa, a collaboration between the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Edinburgh and Georgia State UniversityProf Cathy Ward, associate professor at the department of psychology at UCT, said violence against children costs the country an enormous amount of money and places a burden on the healthcare system, social development, education sector, the justice system and other sectors. These findings highlight how preventing violence against children is a matter of urgency and is also an effective investment that will yield many social and economic returns for South Africa Ward said.The study comes ahead of the country s 16 Days of Activism for no violence against women and children campaign from Friday.Ward said the figure did not include the cost of violence on the criminal justice, the health system and other sectors due to the lack of data.The study has found that physical violence against children reduces the victims monthly earning potential by 11.7%. If somebody has been injured during a rape and needs to spend time in hospital, then needs to spend time at home recovering, then can only go back to work half the time for a while, all of that is time lost to the economy and to that person, Ward said.The study found that 7.2% of South African children will suffer sexual violence, 26.1% will suffer from physical violence while 12.6% will suffer emotional violence.Save The Children CEO, Gugu Ndebele, said the report will compel government, civil society and society to work together, plan, budget and implement better going forward.The study has also revealed that the country loses 50% more healthy lives through violence against children than to diabetes and strokes combined.Lerato Dialeleratod@thenewage.co.za
