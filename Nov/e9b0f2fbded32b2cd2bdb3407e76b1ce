After the Note 7 and its exploding batteries turned into a manufacturing nightmare for Samsung, the firm is determined to get back on track with a device that showcases its finest mobile technology. Samsung&#8217;s future flagship handset, the Galaxy S8, is expected Q1 2017.The Samsung Galaxy S8 will evidently come loaded with top-end components, such as new-generation processors like the Snapdragon 835 (principally used in the USA) or the Exynos 8895 (for the rest of the world), plus 6GB of RAM. As for storage, the device could be in store for 256GB of onboard memory, bringing it in line with the latest-gen iPhone.Inspired by the Xiaomi Mi Mix, Samsung could be tempted to build a smartphone with a curved screen covering almost all of the device&#8217;s front face. As a result, the S8 could land with two different-sized large-format displays with 5.7-inch and 6.2-inch models, both with UHD resolution (3,840 x 2,160 pixels) while keeping the same form factor as the Galaxy S7.To achieve that, Samsung may rid the front of the phone of all its buttons, whether mechanical or touch-sensitive.The Galaxy S8 could also be the first of the South Korean tech giant&#8217;s smartphones to come with some form of &#8220;Force Touch&#8221; technology, already seen at Apple and Huawei. This allows the phone to sense different levels of pressure applied to the screen for varying functionality in the OS or apps.Like an increasing number of rivals in the high-end smartphone market, Samsung could equip its Galaxy S8 with a dual camera, possibly with an optical zoom. Plus, the S8 could be in line for a USB Type-C port and iris scanner technology for identifying users, along with a fingerprint reader.However, the biggest new feature in the Galaxy S8 may not be immediately visible. The phone could, in fact, debut a new intelligent voice assistant based on technology from Viv, which Samsung bought in 2016.Samsung hopes to offer to its users a simplified and intelligent interface, and an AI-based virtual assistant that understands the user&#8217;s context and offers the most appropriate and convenient suggestions and recommendations. In the long term, Samsung may roll out the technology to all of its connected devices (TVs, fridges, etc.).It is not yet known when Samsung will present its new flagship smartphone. The handset is likely to be unveiled at next year&#8217;s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain (February 27 to March 2, 2017), or at a special event in the aftermath.-Relaxnews
