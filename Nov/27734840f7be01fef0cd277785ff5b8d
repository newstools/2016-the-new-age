The most important weapon against cancer is if people detect it early and seek medical attention.This was the message when officials from the local government and human settlements department and the premier s office marched in the streets of Mahikeng to raise awareness about the disease.The officials marched for 10km, drawing people s attention to the disease that has caused untold human suffering across all races and classes.Cancer is seen as a leading cause of death for people from all walks of life and the major challenge has been that victims detect it when it has damaged the body already.Some charities and organisations around the world have taken the initiative to raise funds that is directed towards research into the causes and possible prevention measures for cancer. Addressing those who marched in Mahikeng, Tshepo Kola, the deputy director for employee health and wellness, emphasised the importance of self or clinical inspection to detect the disease at an early stage. Early detection of the condition can lead to effective treatment and a positive prognosis, Kola said. This could be done through regular medical checkups and self-examinations. About 90% of patients survive for many years after diagnosis when cancer is detected at an early stage. Regular self-breast examination, checking for growths, lumps and bumps for both men and women in areas such as the mouth and breasts are key to earlydetection. Stats said the incidence of breast cancer was increasing and it was one of the most common diseases among South African women.Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among white and Asian women and the second most common cancer among black and coloured women. Presenting yourself early for treatment may result in a more effective treatment, leading to a reduction in pain and suffering and a significant decrease in the loss of life. Men too should present themselves for regular medical checkups for prostate and other types of cancer, Kola said.Figures from the World Health Organisation (WHO) show that an estimated 508000 women died in 2011 due to breast cancer.Although breast cancer is thought to be a disease of the developed world, almost 50% of breast cancer cases and 58% of deaths occur in less developed countries.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
