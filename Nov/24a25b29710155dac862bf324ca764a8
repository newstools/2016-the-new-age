&nbsp;While Banyana Banyana interim coach Desiree Ellis is out to prove that she deserves the job on a full-time basis, the Africa Women Cup of Nations match against Cameroon in Yaounde tonight will be her biggest test.Since she took over from Vera Pauw, Ellis is yet to face a worthy opponent, having already played Egypt and Zimbabwe since her tenure started. She defeated both in friendly matches, only to draw 0-0 with Zimbabwe in their tournament opener on Saturday.Tonight, however, Banyana face a strong Cameroon, loudly spurred on by their home crowd and will also need no motivation to roll on following their impressive 2-0 victory over Egypt in their opener.Conversely, Banyana s goalless draw against Zimbabwe means they are flirting with elimination and will be desperate for victory. To achieve that, they will need accuracy in front of goal after their wasteful display against Zimbabwe.Goalkeeper Andile Dlamini has a massive job on her hands if she is to keep another clean sheet, but the West Africans are a different proposition altogether. I am happy I kept a clean sheet, although there were moments in the match where I was under pressure and was bombarded in the six-yard area, Dlamini said. As the last line of defence, I had to ensure that my game was on point. I must also congratulate my defence because this is all about teamwork. We did well and I am confident we will do even better against Cameroon. NevilleKhoza|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
