Children from schools around the Sol Plaatje municipality were given early Christmas presents when the Motsepe Foundation brought balls for all sporting codes and T-shirts and had motivational talks.With schools closing next month, the Foundation urged young people to stay away from all the wrong things and to keep healthy.Municipal spokesperson Gregory Seleke said the visit by the Foundation was part of bringing smiles to the children from previously disadvantaged communities with sports equipment. We received visitors from the Foundation who distributed festive goodies to previously disadvantaged children in and around our jurisdiction, Seleke said.Patrick Neleng from the municipality represented the office of the mayor. He appealed to young children to stay away from alcohol and substance abuse and to rather focus on their school work.Schools which received the presents from the foundation included Tshwarelela, Groenpunt and Kevin Nkoane primary schools.Officials from the departments of social development and education also graced the event and thanked the foundation for donating the presents to the needy schools which were in dire need of assistance.The foundation said they recently completed their review of the 10 top performing schools in each province with a key focus on assessing how they could pledge their support to improve learning and educational conditions. Pupils from less successful schools will also be identified and included in our bursary programme. By identifying these schools and the pupils in them we are able to catalyse the existing academic progress of the pupils, the Foundation said.The Foundation said the impact of their initiatives continued to grow and changed the lives of ordinary South Africans who were from poor backgrounds. We appreciate all the work that is being done by different forums and stakeholders including the government . We are adamant in ensuring that we do not lose momentum in each of our initiatives. We remain firm in our efforts to alleviate poverty and give access to opportunity for communities across the country, the Foundation said.Recently, the Minister of Social Development, Bathabile Dlamini, appealed to society to tackle gangsterism in the province.Dlamini said the young people must come with innovative ideas on how to turn the province around and fight social ills.Dlamini encouraged young people of the province to stay away from drugs and alcohol to better their lives and ensure a healthy lifestyle.She said parents had a huge role to play in ensuring the youth were empowered and motivated to deal with the challenges of life. Parents must learn to negotiate with their children. This generation of children is very different from the one when we grew up, she said.Dlamini said the department was in the process of creating a national register for child-headed households across the country.Tiisetso Manokotiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
