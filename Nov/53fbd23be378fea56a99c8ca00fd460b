Resident in the province who have decided to throw their support behind the ANC in the recent 2016 local government elections and ensure that the ruling party surpassed its challengers, were lauded by the party s leadership both at national and provincial levels.Their support saw the ANC retaining control of all the provincial municipalities including 17 local municipalities and three district municipalities.President Jacob Zuma, in his capacity as the ruling party s national leader, expressed his appreciation to the voters regarding the party s victory to continue leading the provincial municipalities and people to remain behind the ANC despite internal problems.Zuma was speaking during a rally in Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge on Saturday. He said he was concerned about people who were on a mission of destroying the ANC because of their own agendas. We are appealing to the people to continue relying on the ANC which is the only true liberation movement. They should not be discouraged by those who are continuing to hate the ANC with a purpose of destroying the party as a result of their own agendas. We are also thanking those who have supported the ANC during the local government elections and make it to continue remaining in the administration control of the municipalities, Zuma said.He was flanked by the long serving ANC provincial chairperson David Mabuza who is also serving his second term as the premier of the province.Mabuza said his province would always throw its support behind the ANC despite criticism made against the party. He also said those who were attacking Zuma were destroying the ANC too and such people deserved to be overpowered. Mpumalanga will always stay as the home of the ANC. Those who are attacking our president are also attacking the ANC. As the province, we will not allow that to happen, Mabuza said.francen@thenewage.co.za
