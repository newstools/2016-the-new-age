Former Free State Stars and Kaizer Chiefs star Sthembiso Ngcobo has joined the growing list of retired footballers venturing into coaching. The lanky Ngcobo disclosed yesterday that he has hung up his boots, having spent the last six months of his playing career at Stars last season.He had rejoined the Bethlehem side six seasons after leaving for Chiefs, where he achieved Telkom Knockout success. He endeared himself to the Chiefs faithful when his brace floored their bitter rivals in the final in 2009. Ironically, in his last game for Stars he scored against Chiefs in the 2-2 draw at Goble Park.Reflecting on his career that spanned 15 years, the 33-yearold Ngcobo said he had no regrets. His highlight was when he was called up by Carlos Alberto Parreira for Bafana Bafana. I had good and bad times at both club and Bafana Bafana levels. Teams treat players differently. To make it in the professional ranks was an honour, Ngcobo said. He had two stints with AmaZulu and also played for Wits. Ngcobo said he was looking forward to starting the introductory coaching course organised by the South African Football Players Union in Durban before the end of the month.He will attend the course alongside the likes of former Bafana Bafana international Mbulelo OJ Mabizela and exGolden Arrows and Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Papi Zothwane. My main aim is to set up an academy in my village of Ndwedwe. Over the years, I have been organising football tournaments for local teams as a way of giving back to my community. news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
