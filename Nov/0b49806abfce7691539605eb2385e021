VETERAN stand-up comedian, Kedibone Mulaudzi refers to himself as SA s number one underrated comedian a tag he said he is comfortable wearing even though he has more than a decade of comedy experience under his belt.The Limpopo-born funny man, who became the first gospel comedian when he was made resident comedian with gospel ensemble Joyous Celebration, a few years ago, is always trying to push comedy boundaries, as a mentor, a business person or as a stand-up comedian.After over three years spent behind the scenes organising comedy shows, Mulaudzi is back on the forefront with his one man show, Underrated Comedy in 3D set for Soweto Theatre on November 11 and 12. This kind of comedy has never been done before. I will be showcasing my act in a three dimensional stage presentation, where I will present my material, while also having visuals of some of my act on stage as well as the screen set up on stage to give the show a three dimensional take, the entrepreneurial comedian said.Mulaudzi is always looking to perfect his art of story telling and with this one he has gone for something he believes has not been done anywhere in the world. I am always breaking new ground and looking for ways to make my act better than the previous one. Part of it is being able to tell stories or talk about things people know and they want to talk about but they can t because they are not supposed to. It will be dirty work for the public. I will also be handing out advice on how people can laugh without actually going to a comedy show, he said.Over the years, Mulaudzi has helped shape the careers of some of the country s leading and up and coming comedians through many of the shows that he organises and the workshops that he runs on a regular basis.He has had a hand in staging festivals such as the Soweto International Comedy Festival, and State Theatre comedy nights.On the performance side of things, the comedian has had the pleasure of performing for South Africa s three state presidents, appeared on two Comedy Central specials, Comedy Central Roast, Soweto, as well as the Comedy Fest International tour, his UK London performance at the Southbank Centre and many other shows locally and internationally.The comedian laments lack of ownership by black comedians in the industry. We, as comedians, have to start thinking about owning a piece of our own pie, he said. White people have perfected the game of owning their own sound, stage and audio visual equipment. We need to start thinking about owning these things and have a stake in the industry, he said.-siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
