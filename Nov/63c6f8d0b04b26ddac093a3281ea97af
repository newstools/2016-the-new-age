Demagoguery is cheap.It was French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupery who said demagoguery enters at the moment, when for the want of a common denominator, the principle of equality degenerates into the principle of identity .We have seen a combination of reprehensible events and utterings about race and racism hardly believable 22 years into our democracy.EFF leader Julius Malema, in one of the most inflammatory and crude statements (and there are many) of his short political career, said: We are not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least not for now. True to form, the demagogues on the right, the volk who are once again stocking up on tinned food, water, ammunition and guns in secret cellars, said to Malema bring it on .One of the most horrific incidents is the live entombing in a coffin of black man who was being punished by two white farmers for crossing their land last month.Former finance minister Trevor Manuel, in his tribute to Nelson Mandela on his death, said the sense he had of Madiba was: Mentally out ahead and physically perfectly in sync with the front ranks. When Mandela became our first president, he fully understood the need to ensure that our transition to democracy from apartheid was managed carefully. He knew that for the process of healing to be effected after the bitter struggle against apartheid, a catharsis was necessary.For this purpose the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to investigate race-related crimes and coming to forgiving and fair conclusions on cases that took place between 1 st March 1960 and May 10, 1994.The aim of the TRC and its chairperson, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was to address the harsh realities of a divided society and promote reconciliation through the sharing of human experience.While the commission was operative, it handled the testimonies of around 21000 victims of apartheid.Always one step ahead, Mandela took his reconciliation efforts to an extraordinary level in August 1995 when he visited Betsy Verwoerd in the whites only enclave of Orania.He even undertook a trip to a nearby monument to Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid and prime minister of South Africa when Mandela was jailed for life at the 1964 Rivonia trial.The Institute for Justice and Reconciliation, the think tank carrying on the commission s work to present day, states its vision as building fair, democratic and inclusive societies in South Africa.Ongoing reconciliation in our country is an effort that has received praise from around the globe a first of its kind concept that has since been replicated in numerous post-conflict societies.Yet, for all the reconciliation path-finding by Mandela, Tutu and many others, when I look at our nation I do not see a society that is fair and inclusive.Instead I see a society that reconciliation has impacted unevenly. We have tended to gloss over the real obstacles and were starry-eyed.As playwright Jane Taylor noted, reconciliation s place in small rural communities, when it establishes itself in a local church hall and absorbs substantial numbers of the population, is very different from its situation in large urban centres where its presence is marginalised by other social and economic activities .Reconciliation may have liberated some from criminality, but it has not liberated whole communities from the extreme economic and social segregation that they continue to endure.Even after two decades of living post-apartheid, racial equality is not something we have achieved.Only 66% of black South Africans born after 1994 can expect to graduate from high school, while the comparative figure for their white peers is 99%. Some 19 million people in our nation live below the poverty line and you guessed it 98% are either black or coloured.Under these conditions, it s little wonder that the sentiments expressed by Malema are gaining support.We need a new reconciliation coupled with the courage and bravery of a Madiba. Not the loose kind we have previously seen, in which enemies revisit their trauma, shake hands and vow to make peace.We need a reconciliation that addresses the true economic and legal roots of our racial inequality. We need a kind that no longer allows white people to hang onto their historic advantages and privileges by virtue of skin colour alone.The notion of a rainbow nation does not have to die as Malema and Steve Hofmeyr would like it to. Instead, it is time for a revised and reinvigorated reconciliation effort. It is time for the government, civil society and big business to come together to work out a way forward.Corporate South Africa, which is majority white-owned, is maintaining the status-quo and perpetuating poverty.Big business has an important role to play in empowering all South Africans and it is time it did. Together, all factions of South African society must agree the new terms with which we can reconcile once and for all.As the true custodians of nonracialism, the ANC is pivotal in fighting this battle. It owes it to the people of South Africa to take a lead in addressing the problem.The ANC is the only truly non-racial political party we have. It is a legacy that is decades old, established by Luthuli, Tambo, Sisulu and Mandela. Demagogues normally choose the path of least resistance. Building a single nation on the ruins of apartheid separation was always going to be a difficult task.It s going to come at a cost and through the hard work of sensible and good men and women, black and white.Moegsien Williams is Editor-in-Chief of The New Age
