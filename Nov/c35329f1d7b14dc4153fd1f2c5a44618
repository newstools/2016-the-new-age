Minutes after being released on bail, #FeesMustFall activist Mcebo Dlamini yesterday started making demands from Wits University.After the South Gauteng High Court sitting at Palm Ridge Magistrate s Court had overturned a Johannesburg Magistrate s Court ruling that denied him bail, Dlamini called for Wits to have two examination sittings. It will be a failure if our people are forced to write exams under these conditions, under torture. Our people are not psychologically ready. We demand a meeting with management. We are now making a call to the university, they must announce two sittings. Otherwise daai poppe sal dans (all hell will break loose), he said.Dlamini said two sittings were different from deferred exams as people who write in the second sitting would still have another chance if they do not do well to write supplementary examinations. If our people are forced to write there will be a mass failure. The only people who are writing exams are the white minority, those are the only ones who are ready as they had all the time and material to prepare while we were on the streets, he said.Wits University spokesperson Shirona Patel said the university announced deferred examinations that would be written in December and January for students who did not want to write during the current examinations, which are in their second week.Mcebo was released on R2000 bail after he won his appeal yesterday.He was earlier denied bail by the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court, but this was overturned by high court judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng who said his reasons would be revealed in two weeks time.Dlamini, 30, was arrested in October on charges of public violence, malicious damage to property, theft and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Bail is fixed at R2000 and the conditions are that he is ordered to desist from unlawful disruption of the academic activities at Wits. He is entitled to participate in lawful activities on the campus, not to interfere with the charges against him and is prohibited from communicating with witnesses, Mokgoatlheng said.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
