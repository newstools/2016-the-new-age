With almost 3000km of coast and 13000 marine species, South Africa s rich coastal waters support thousands of jobs and contribute millions to the national economy each year. Marine Protected Areas are widely advocated as an effective tool for securing and restoring the health of our oceans. These areas play a vital role in maintaining biological diversity and sensitive ecosystems so that we can continue to enjoy the benefits of our coastline.So what are Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)?MPAs are designated areas of our oceans that have legal protection, allowing them to be managed so that critical habitats and species can be protected.South Africa has 24 existing coastal MPAs, with a further 22 mid-ocean MPAs proposed by the government s Operation Phakisa. The Convention on Biological Diversity has set a goal of conserving 10% of the world s oceans as MPAs by the year 2020. South Africa is also committed to meeting this target.Why are MPAs important for conserving marine life?Oceans play a critical role in regulating our climate and providing food. By protecting natural marine habitats, we not only help to combat climate change but also set aside areas where fish can lay their eggs and the young fry can grow to replenish our fish stock. In this way, MPAs do not only play a vital role in protecting natural systems but also help to meet our human needs, be it for food, recreation or income generation.How would local communities benefit from more MPAs?Healthy marine ecosystems benefit those who rely on them for their livelihoods. At present, a number of South Africa s marine resources are overexploited, which results in a loss of potential food protein, livelihoods and income, as well as the loss of the traditional fishing culture associated with South Africa s coastal communities.One of the main reasons why we need to set aside MPAs is to provide breeding sanctuaries for fish species, which can then repopulate the surrounding coastal areas. Effective management of MPAs would benefit both the planet and people in many ways.How do MPAs contribute towards research?MPAs are important research sites which can provide us with vital information about our climate and marine environment.Research results presented at the 9th MPA Forum in Port Elizabeth, convened by WWF South Africa, included work on kelp growth in the De Hoop area, a study into the conservation of the great white sharks and a wealth of information gathered from underwater cameras.Where are South Africa s 24 MPAs located?South Africa s existing MPAs can be found dotted along our coastline from KwaZulu-Natal to the West Coast.Some of our more well-known MPAs are the Tsitsikamma, Table Mountain National Park, iSimangaliso Wetland Park and Aliwal Shoal off KwaZulu-Natal, which is famous for shark diving.We also have one of the largest MPAs in the world, the Prince Edward Island around our island territories in the Southern Ocean.These MPAs include no-take zones where fishing is prohibited and controlled areas where limited fishing activities are allowed and many encompass areas of great natural beauty and are home to unique species like African penguins.But there are still many areas in need of protection due to new threats, including seabed mining which could disrupt some of our most important commercial fisheries. While 23% of the length of our coastline is protected through MPAs (9% of which are no-take ), less than 0.5% of South Africa smainland ocean ecosystems are formally protected by area, compared to about 8% of land areas.How do MPAs feature in the government s Operation Phakisa project?The government s Operation Phakisa aims to tap into the economic potential of South Africa s oceans economy on the basis that our oceans have the potential to contribute up to R177bn to the gross domestic product (GDP) and create more than 1 million jobs by 2033.However, given the increasing demands put on our ocean, to ensure their long-term health, we need to improve the management of our existing resources and MPAs form a critical part of this approach.What are the plans for expansion under Operation Phakisa?In 2016, the minister of Environmental Affairs published a draft notice to propose a network of 22 new MPAs with the aim of creating about 70000km of additional MPAs. If proclaimed this will bring ocean protection within the South African Exclusive Economic Zone to about 5%.These areas still need public support to make them a reality.
