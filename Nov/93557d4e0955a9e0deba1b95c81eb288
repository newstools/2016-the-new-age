As Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela returns to the FNB Stadium tonight, a venue where a section of unruly Amakhosi supporters threw missiles at him in the last match, he will be well aware that anything less than victory against inform Cape Town City will not be acceptable. Chiefs fans were not happy with Komphela following the club s 1-1 draw against SuperSport United last Wednesday.Chiefs will have to show massive improvement against a side that comes from a 4-1 victory over Free State Stars in the Telkom Knockout semifinal. Top of Komphela s agenda will be to repel deadly counterattacking moves from Eric Tinkler s side. One thing to mention is that they are lethal on counterattacks. They are also strong on set pieces. There are a lot of variations and we need to be aware of that, Komphela said. They have good players in their team. We will need to respect them and adopt an approach that can help us win the match. City and Chiefs have already met this season, in the MTN8 competition, with the Cape Town side squeezing out a 1-0 win to knock the Soweto giants out of the cup competition. Komphela does not think City s approach will differ from the last time the two teams locked horns. They haven t changed much since we played them. They are stuck on their game plan of breaking out in attacks. Even the goal they scored came from a Lewis Macha header. Their goalkeeper made a save and started a counter move. They went on to score and that s how we lost the match.City inform captain Lebogang Manyama is one player who is likely to give Chiefs defenders a lot of work to keep him contained. Manyama, formerly with Ajax Cape Town and SuperSport United, has scored five goals in 10 league appearances this season. Komphela will pin his hopes on left winger George Lebese to turn the corner for the club.nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
