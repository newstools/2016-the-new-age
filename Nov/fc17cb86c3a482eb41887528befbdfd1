Uber launched its on-demand car ride services in the perennially jammed Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Tuesday, saying it would help reduce congestion in one of the world&#8217;s largest metropolises.Dhaka is the 33rd city in South Asia where the smartphone taxi app is now available.The city&#8217;s first Uber ride was made by Bangladeshi cricket star Shakib Al Hasan, according to the California-based company, adding its technology would help reduce traffic and improve air quality.&#8220;Uber has a simple goal: to use technology to make our cities more accessible while reducing congestion and pollution,&#8221; said Amit Jain, president of Uber India and South Asia.Bangladesh&#8217;s government backed Uber&#8217;s launch in the capital &#8212; which has a population of over 30 million in the city and adjoining industrial towns but lacks a metro system, leaving residents totally reliant on the heavily congested roads.&#8220;Smart cities are integral parts of the digital Bangladesh and I&#8217;m very excited to have Uber inDhaka as a part of our efforts to build smart cities,&#8221; said junior Information Technology Minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak.There was no immediate comment from the city&#8217;s taxi drivers or the powerful army-linked company that runs a fleet of more expensive cabs.Uber has revolutionised car share rides across the globe since it was launched in 2010, becoming one of the world&#8217;s most valuable startups.But it has faced protests from established taxi operators in most locations where it has launched and been hit by a series of lawsuits and regulatory hurdles.-AFP
