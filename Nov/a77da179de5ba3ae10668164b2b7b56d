South Korean prosecutors investigating a corruption scandal engulfing President Park-Geun Hye have quizzed Samsung group scion and the chairman of Hyundai Motor, a report said Sunday.Lee Jae-Yong, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and the heir-apparent of the Samsung group, was being questioned by prosecutors, Yonhap news agency said.It cited an official at the Seoul prosecutors&#8217; office, which is probing whether Park pressured the firms to donate millions of dollars to dubious foundations controlled by her longtime confidant, Choi Soon-Sil.Samsung made the largest donation of more than $15 million and is accused of separately offering 2.8 million euros ($3.1 million) to Choi to bankroll her daughter&#8217;s equestrian training in Germany.Hyundai Motor chairman Chung Mong-Koo was also quizzed along with the bosses of other powerful conglomerates, Yonhap said.The president reportedly had a meeting last July with the top businessmen at her office and urged them to donate money to the two cultural foundations that Choi used for personal gain.Prosecutors also announced Sunday a plan to quiz Park this week. If this happens she will be the first South Korean president to be questioned by prosecutors while in office.The &#8220;donations&#8221; from the firms amounted to nearly $70 million, including 20 billion won ($17.5 million) from Samsung and 12.8 billion won from Hyundai.Choi was arrested recently for allegedly using her ties with Park to coerce donations from the firms and meddling in a wide range of state affairs although she holds no official position.The scandal has sparked nationwide fury and massive protests calling for Park to resign.-AFP
