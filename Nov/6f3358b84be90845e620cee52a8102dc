The embarrassment of losing to almost all their rivals this year has been too much to bear for the Springboks and assistant coach Johan van Graan does not see the trend continuing when they face Italy on Saturday. Following losses to Australia, New Zealand, Wales and Argentina, the Boks were last week beaten by England in a match that further confirmed that the Boks are no longer the force they once were.With Adriaan Strauss edging closer to retirement after the next two matches, coach Allister Coetzee will have more questions to answer. With more problems waiting for the Boks once they conclude the northern hemisphere tour, assistant coach Van Graan is choosing to focus on the Italy match as he believes the Boks can get something out of the clash at the Artemio Franchi Stadium in Florence. Italy will be a tough opponent at home, playing with a lot of pride and passion and they will be looking for an improved performance against the Springboks. We want to be technically and tactically better against a side that is playing at home and eager to show improvement, Van Graan said. But, as I said, we must improve in other areas as well. I think our scrumming against England was probably the best in the past five years or so and our line-outs functioned well too. There is no doubt that the Boks game will take a massive knock ahead of the Italy clash, with Eben Etzebeth missing out and Pieter-Steph du Toit having to keep changing positions. This will also mean more time to adjust for Lood de Jager, who has to play with a different lock partner this weekend.Coetzee will name his team to face Italy today, with Strauss and Pat Lambie expected to lead the attack, while Bryan Habana returns from injury to possibly start on the wing alongside Ruan Combrinck, with JP Pietersen expected to sit on the bench. Given how Coetzee sees things, Nizaam Carr might start at flank.mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za-Mmasekepe Matsebane
