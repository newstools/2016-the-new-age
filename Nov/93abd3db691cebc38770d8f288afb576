The provincial department of education has expressed its readiness as the marking of Grade 12 examination scripts begins on Saturday.The announcement of the results will be made at the former Mpumalanga Agricultural College s campus in Marapyane near KwaMhlanga on January 5.Some 60764 full-time and 7038 part-time pupils sat for the examination at the province s 552 centres.Provincial education spokesperson Jasper Zwane said the marking process was expected to be completed in a period of 10 days.Zwane said the appointment of more than 4000 markers had already been organised. All systems are in place to manage the second level of the examination process that includes marking, which will be held from December 3-13, hesaid. The Mpumalanga department of education is satisfied with the manner in which the 2016 Grade 12 examination process has unfolded. This marks the sixth year of managing an incident-free, credible and hassle-free examination process. To this effect, the department takes this time to extend its profound appreciation to all officials and teachers who played a pivotal role in ensuring that the integrity of this examination remains uncompromised, Zwane said. He said the department was worried about the so-called pens-down celebrations organised for the pupils after completing the exams, because such events were exposing the pupils to unlawful acts and disturbed their future plans. Such gatherings will not benefit pupils in any way but have the potential of exposing them to social ills and dangers related to drug and alcohol abuse, as well as drinking and driving. The other concern for the department is that these activities present opportunities that may cause pupils to lose focus on the long-term goals of achieving their National Senior Certificate and pursuing tertiary education, which will open future doors forthem. The department further extends its best wishes to all candidates who sat for the examinations, Zwane said.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
