Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and her Director-General Zane Dangor have assured the 17-million recipients of the government social grants that they will be paid in April 2017.However, they declined to give details of how payments will be made when the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) takes over responsibility for a contract which the Constitutional Court has ruled as unlawful and which expires at the end of March next year. We are going to ensure that our people get their money on April 1.We don t want to be pushed into saying who is going to pay the money. It looks if there are other interests beside the interest of human rights of recipients to get grants, Dlamini said.She said it seemed as if the Department was being called upon to give a full account of its contingency plans. It s going to put some at an advantage but also it s going to put the work we are doing at risk. With due respect we don t want to risk the work we are doing. Dlamini had to give this reassurance after members of the Social Development Portfolio Committee yesterday vented their frustration over a presentation by Sassa that did not indicate how it planned to pay more than R10bn in monthly social grants from April 2017.The Constitutional Court has ruled that Sassa s contract with its present service was unlawful but determined that it should run until its completion on March 31 next year. There were options on the table, Dangor said. Whatever option is exercised: grants must be paid. The contract is invalid. We are dealing with a legal minefield. We are also dealing with a litigious partner. If a contract is invalid you cannot extend it. He declined to say which option would be chosen. That is asking us to go into details. I m uncomfortable doing that. We are working closely with the Reserve Bank. What we can say is we are committed to pay this grant on the first of April. DENNIS CRUYWAGEN news@thenewage.co.za
