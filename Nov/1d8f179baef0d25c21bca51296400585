THE king of Afro-tribal dance music, Rabs Vhafuwi, real name, Rabelani Madula, is back with his second offering, Hear Me Now. Speaking to The New Age, the ace producer, who began his foray in dance music culture as a DJ and then transitioned to producing hits in 2012, is one of the artists in the line-up of this year s Reconciliation Festival set for Carnival City on December 3.Other big names in the line-up include acts such as Lira, Zonke, Zahara, as well as singing sensation Amanda Black and Sjava. I will be showcasing some of the songs from my new album, Hear Me Now, while also performing some of the songs from my first album.I have been asked by people to define my kind of music and those who are not familiar with it will soon find that it is a mixture of house and soulful tribal sounds which I personally call Afro Tribal as the music fits both deep house music fans as well as tribal music lovers, the Dzimauli Mukondeni musician and producer said.The good thing about the line-up for this year s edition of the Reconciliation Festival is that it is dominated by SA s powerful women of song, and most of them are musicians Rabs has been dreaming of teaming up with. I have always wanted to work with Zonke, and I look forward to working with her when a chance presents itself. I have already worked with Zahara on a song for DJ Sbu and right now am busy with yet another DJ Sbu song which will feature Simphiwe Dana, one of the artists I have always dreamt of working with.The 15-track offering, he says has been well received on digital platforms though he is yet to take it to the stores as the official release is later this week. On the album there are songs such as Lufuno,Entara,Sofiatown, The Village Pride, King of Kings, The Healing and Baleka, which are proving popular on stations such as Y-FM and Metro FM.I even got a call from Oskido last week who called me king of Afro-tribal which is a big thing for me, he said. Last year, the festival took place on the same day that South Africans from around the world observed the Day of Reconciliation on December 16, while this year, the festival takes place on an earlier date. This year the line-up is dominated by SA s biggest female voices.siyabongas@thenewage.co.zaSIYABONGA SITHOLE
