Banyana Banyana Captain Janine Van Wyk said South Africa is traditionally a slow starter in the continental showpiece. She insists that they usually build up and reach both the semi&#8217;s and finals. &#8220;I think this is another chance for us to do that tomorrow (Wednesday ) and hopefully go to the finals,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We looking forward to it, it&#8217;s really exciting. It would be the first time for some players to play Nigeria in a Semi final,&#8221; the Captain added. Coach Desiree Ellis said she we will be playing two up front, indicating her intent to attack,&#8221;at the end of the day it&#8217;s a game you have to win, there is no playing for a point&#8221; the former national team captain said. &#8220;And hopefully we will be a little compact at the back. Our defence has been a strong point at the moment we just need to use the creativity that we have in the team. We&#8217;ve created many opportunities, hopefully this time around with all the opportunities we create we can,&#8221; added Ellis. Nigerian coach Florence Omagbemi told the Caf website that they are fully prepared for the semi-final against South Africa. &#8220;The spirit in camp is high, and the players and officials are looking forward to the game. The approach against South Africa will be different. We are in the knock-out stage and expectations are high. We are getting closer to the trophy and our aim here is to defend our title,&#8221; she said The Nigerian mentor said at this level expectations are high, the messages for the game against Banyana is different because the team is at a different stage. &#8220;We are fortunate to watch some of their games and we will evaluate the team based on that. Every game has a different approach and expectation. We know the players that are ready for this game,&#8221; Omagbemi claimed. She believes that nothing will stop her team from reaching the final, stating that the confidence levels in her squad are high. TNA Reporter
