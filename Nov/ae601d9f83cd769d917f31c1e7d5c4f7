The Chamber of Mines has welcomed a Labour Court decision to set aside a court order that unnecessarily halted operations at AngloGold Ashanti s Kopanang mine over safety issues.The world s top platinum producer has for years complained that government inspectors have been imposing arbitrary work stoppages over safety, costing billions of rand in lost output and putting mines and jobs on the line.The ruling concerned a Section 54 safety stoppage named for the regulation they fall under at AngloGold s Kopanang gold mine, in the Free State, last month.The judge found the blanket stoppage of the entire mine because of infractions related to tramming and the storage of explosives in one section level 44 was disproportionate and should have been applied to just that area of the operation.Section 54 of the Mine Health and Safety Act allows the Department of Mineral Resources to stop production at a mine where an accident has occurred or a safety-related malpractice has been identified.Kopanang was shut down last month when the regional inspector for the department s North West division spotted explosive cartridges that had not been returned to their boxes on level 44 of the mine.A court order was issued and confirmed by the mining inspectorate, effectively halting production at the mine under Section 54 of the Health and Safety Act. Judge Andr van Niekerk set the court order aside, thus allowing the mine s reopening and continuation of production.Van Niekerk lambasted the inspectorate and the department officials for closing down the whole mine when transgressions affected only a very small portion of the mine.He said an objective state of affairs did not exist which would lead to a reasonable person to believe it might endanger the health and safety of any person at the mine. An instruction that applied to the whole mine was not necessary to protect the health and safety of persons at the mine, Van Niekerk said. The operations at level 44 comprised a very small portion of the total mining operations, therefore no circumstances existed that rendered the whole mine unsafe. The Chamber of Mines said the court ruling had clarified the limits on the power of the inspectorate. The industry has sought to persuade the Department of Mineral Resources in engagements on this issue, to avoid unjustified stoppages that are responsible for compounding industry losses in already trying financial times, it said.A chamber report last year estimated that the inappropriate application of safety stoppages under the Mine Health and Safety Act cost the mining industry R4.84bn in lost revenue.Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane, commenting recently on safety issues, said the department was aware of endeavours made by the industry but remained concerned about the safety performance of South African mines. The department is continuing to strengthen enforcement compliance at mines and has added 38 inspectors this year to enhance enforcement, he said. with ReutersTHELMA NGOMA |thelman@thenewage.co.za
