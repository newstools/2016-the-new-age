The DA has told Nathi Nhleko in no uncertain terms it will not allow Parliament to be undermined by a police minister who thinks he can tell the legislature when and how high to jump.The strong words from Parliament s biggest opposition party came after Nhleko had written to speaker Baleka Mbete asking the legislature to initiate removal proceedings against the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, Robert McBride.In his letter, according to the DA, Nhleko said he was requesting a Parliamentary enquiry into McBride s fitness to hold office, but he was actually requesting the initiation of removal proceedings based on sections 17DA(3) to 17DA(5) of the SAPS Act, as read into the Ipid Act .It would write to Mbete, the DA said, urging that she obtain legal advice concerning both the shortcomings of the minister s request and the soundness of its alternative proposal for how this matter should be handled. There are constitutional principles at stake and any actions taken must be based on due process and done uncompromisingly by the book, the DA said.It said that in September the Constitutional Court specifically determined as the DA contended that the police minister has absolutely no authority to summarily suspend McBride without Parliament instituting the necessary processes .It believed that a Parliamentary enquiry, based on the Rules of the National Assembly, which would receive representations from both the minister and McBride would be a more appropriate first step in response to the minister s request, said the DA.This was because Parliamentary proceedings, based on sections 17DA(3) to 17DA(5) of the SAPS Act, as read in the Ipid Act, presupposed an intended end removal from office as opposed to being an open-ended process that could result in any outcome. For this to be just and fair, there would first need to have been a finding of wrongdoing by McBride which is not an established fact. Indeed, the minister writes in his letter as if it is a foregone conclusion that McBride should be suspended, his mind is made up on the underlying assumption of guilt and thus Parliament should just rubber-stamp his determination. We will not allow Parliament to be undermined by the minister. Nhleko s spokesman Sandile Ngidi said yesterday it was irresponsible of the DA to accuse the Minister as it had done. There is an impasse between the Minister and the IPID head. Parliament needs to resolve it. There is a court order to that effect. It s quite irresponsible of the DA to try and ridicule the Minister, he said.DENNIS CRUYWAGEN dennis@thenewage.co.za
