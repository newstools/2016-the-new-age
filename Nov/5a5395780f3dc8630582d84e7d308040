BARELY months into the new season and Highlands Park are struggling to find their feet in the elite league. Coach Gordon Igesund, who was brought in to turn around the fortunes of the team and succeed where erstwhile Allan Freese failed, is finding the task arduous. The well-travelled Igesund, known to achieve success with lowly sides, is not entirely impressed with the squad he has inherited and is looking to bolster the team during the January transfer market.Highlands Park were defeated 1-0 at home on Sunday by the in form Golden Arrows and this result irked Igesund. Highlands have made some good signings including Thaduyise Khuboni and Collins Mbesuma, but they have been battling to make an impact. Igesund may not have as much cash to splash in the market, however, as Highlands aren t exactly a club awash with money to go big in the transfers. We got to improve in certain areas, Igesund said. We have to wait until January to see what we can do. I m not saying we re going to run into the market and sign a million players, but we do need to strengthen in certain areas. Igesund acknowledged his side had a long way to go and he would work with the players he has. We are a little bit naive and we are very inexperienced, Igesund said. A lot of work needs to be done. We ve got to look at the market where we have to go and get one or two more players in certain areas. At the end of the day we will keep our heads up and keep working. I know what I m working with, I know what I have. The Lions of the North have amassed six points from eight games, winning only one game, losing four games and drawing three. Things might go from bad to worse for the Tembisa-based club when they face log leaders Bidvest Wits at the Bidvest Stadium tonight. Wits are coming into the match brimming with confidence following their gutsy 1-0 win over Platinum Stars and are eager to stretch their lead at the top. They are the only unbeaten team this season.news@thenewage.co.za-Ntsako Mashaba
