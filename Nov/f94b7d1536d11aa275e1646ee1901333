The death of Cuba&#8217;s Fidel Castro prompted reaction across the spectrum Saturday with some world leaders describing him as a friend and ally, while rights groups recalled his repression of basic freedoms.Here are some responses to the death of the 90-year-old Cold War icon, whose life was defined by his resistance to the capitalist United States.&#8211; Barack Obama &#8211;&#8220;History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him,&#8221; said the US president, who made a landmark visit to Cuba in March after diplomatic ties between the two nations were restored.&#8211; Donald Trump &#8211;The US president-elect called Castro a &#8220;brutal dictator&#8221;, but made no overt mention of earlier threats to roll back a historic rapprochement.&#8220;Fidel Castro&#8217;s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights,&#8221; Trump said in a statement.&#8211; Vladimir Putin &#8211;&#8220;The name of this distinguished statesman is rightly considered the symbol of an era in modern world history,&#8221; the Russian president said.&#8220;Fidel Castro was a sincere and reliable friend of Russia.&#8221;&#8211; Xi Jinping &#8211;China&#8217;s president hailed Castro in a message read out on state television. &#8220;The Chinese people have lost a good and true comrade,&#8221; he said.&#8220;Comrade Castro will live forever. &#8221;&#8211; Nicolas Maduro &#8211;The Venezuelan president, Cuba&#8217;s main ally in the region, said on Twitter: &#8220;It is up to us to continue his legacy and carry his flag of independence.&#8221;&#8211; Bashar al-Assad &#8211;&#8220;The great leader Fidel Castro led his people&#8217;s and his country&#8217;s struggle against imperialism and hegemony for decades,&#8221; said the Syrian president, hailing Castro&#8217;s &#8220;legendary resistance&#8221; to the US embargo against Cuba.Syria has faced a barrage of US and EU sanctions over its brutal civil war.&#8211; Pope Francis &#8211;The Catholic world leader sent a message saying he was &#8220;praying to the Lord that he may rest in peace&#8221;.&#8211; Ban Ki-moon &#8211;&#8220;Under former president Castro, Cuba made progress in the areas of education, literacy and health,&#8221; the UN secretary-general told journalists.&#8211; Mikhail Gorbachev &#8211;&#8220;Fidel stood up and strengthened his country during the harshest American blockade, when there was colossal pressure on him and he still took his country out of this blockade to a path of independent development,&#8221; Interfax news agency quoted the former Soviet leader as saying.&#8211; Jacob Zuma &#8211;The South African president gave one of the warmest tributes, saying: &#8220;President Castro identified with our struggle against apartheid. He inspired the Cuban people to join us in our own struggle.&#8220;As a way of paying homage to the memory of President Castro, the strong bonds of solidarity, cooperation and friendship that exist between South Africa and Cuba must be maintained and nurtured.&#8221;&#8211; Francois Hollande &#8211;Castro embodied Cuba&#8217;s revolution in both its &#8220;hopes&#8221; and its later &#8220;disappointments&#8221;, the French president said in a statement.&#8211; Narendra Modi &#8211;India&#8217;s prime minister sent his &#8220;deepest condolences&#8221; to Cuba.&#8220;Fidel Castro was one of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century. India mourns the loss of a great friend,&#8221; Modi tweeted.&#8211; Mohammad Javad Zarif &#8211;Castro was &#8220;a unique figure who fought against colonialism and exploitation&#8221; and was &#8220;a model of the fight for independence by oppressed nations&#8221;, said Iran&#8217;s foreign minister, the Fars news agency reported.&#8211; Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva &#8211;Brazil&#8217;s once hugely popular leftist president Lula mourned Castro&#8217;s death as equivalent to losing a brother.&#8220;His spirit of combativeness and solidarity nourished dreams of liberty, sovereignty and equality,&#8221; he said.&#8211; Rodrigo Duterte &#8211;For the Philippines&#8217; president, Castro distinguished himself by &#8220;standing up against the West and imperialism&#8221;.&#8211; Communist Vietnam &#8211;Vietnam&#8217;s official Communist news agency hailed Castro as &#8220;a great leader&#8221; who was &#8220;the shining reflection of the independence and revolutionary movements of countries in Latin America and around the world&#8221;.&#8211; Mahmud Abbas &#8211;&#8220;He was a fierce defender &#8230; of justice in the world,&#8221; said the Palestinian president.&#8211; Diego Maradona &#8211;The Argentine football legend lamented Castro&#8217;s death saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m terribly sad as he was like a second father.&#8221;&#8211; Amnesty International &#8211;The London-based human rights organisation said the state of free expression in Cuba was Castro&#8217;s &#8220;darkest legacy&#8221;.&#8220;Castro&#8217;s achievements in improving access to public services for millions of Cubans were tempered by a systemic repression of basic freedoms,&#8221; Amnesty said.-AFP
