A strong 6.9 magnitude earthquake hit northeastern Japan early Tuesday, the country&#8217;s meteorological agency said, issuing a tsunami warning for the region&#8217;s coast including Fukushima prefecture.A some three metre (9.9 feet) tsunami could hit the northeastern coast, the agency said, including Fukushima &#8212; home to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, site of one of the world&#8217;s worst nuclear disasters.The US Geological Agency said the quake, at a shallow depth of 11.3 kilometres (seven miles), struck shortly before 6:00 am (2100 GMT on Monday) in the Pacific off Fukushima.The nation&#8217;s meteorological agency had earlier estimated the quake&#8217;s magnitude at 7.3.Japan sits at the junction of four tectonic plates and experiences a number of relatively violent quakes every year.A massive undersea quake that hit in March 2011 sent a tsunami barrelling into Japan&#8217;s northeast coast, leaving more than 18,000 people dead or missing, and sending three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant.In April, two strong earthquakes hit southern Japan&#8217;s Kumamoto prefecture followed by more than 1,700 aftershocks, leaving at least 50 dead and causing widespread damage.-AFP
