THABO Mofutsanyana district acting mayor Kanoli Tsoene said that officials will make monitoring visits to local municipalities under its jurisdiction every threemonths to follow up and monitor service delivery projects in the area.The local municipalities that fall under the district are Maluti-a-Phofung, Phumelela, Nketoana, Setsoto, Dihlabeng and Matsopa.He said the visits would help the district to know exactly what is taking place in the local municipalities and provide assistance whenever it is necessary so that service delivery is not compromised where it is needed most.He was speaking during the first visit to the Mantsopa local municipality on Friday where he said other municipalities should expect a visit in the coming weeks. Tsoene said the decision was taken recently by the district council in a bid to remain up to speed with the local authorities. Our position as the district is not to instruct local municipalities what to do but to support them so that they reach even small remote areas like Hobhouse, Excelsor and Tweespruit, Tsoene said. It is at these small areas where people are in desperate need of services and it will be unfair of us to forget about them. Tsoene said they would be visiting one of six local municipalities quarterly and engaging with leaders of different government departments and this move is informed by the provincial government s stand to grow the economy in small towns.-TEBOHO MOLOI
