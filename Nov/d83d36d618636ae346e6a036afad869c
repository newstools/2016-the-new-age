Indian screen icon Shah Rukh Khan has starred in dozens of Bollywood blockbusters and is adored by millions, but there&#8217;s a movie he still dreams of making &#8212; one that&#8217;s a truly global hit.&#8220;I would like to be a part of that one Indian film, as an actor, as a producer, as a gaffer, as a sound recordist, as a production manager, whatever, which becomes famous all over the world,&#8221; Khan told AFP in an interview.&#8220;That&#8217;s my &#8216;Make in India&#8217; dream. I&#8217;ve had this since 25 years,&#8221; he added, borrowing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s much-trumpeted slogan for boosting manufacturing in the country.The Asian giant&#8217;s Hindi film industry churns out hundreds of movies every year, raking in billions of US dollars in ticket receipts, but is yet to release a blockbuster that really takes Western box offices by storm.&#8220;I hope to achieve that but I don&#8217;t sit down with people (and focus on) &#8216;What is the crossover film that we can make?&#8217; No, I think it will happen because I believe in it,&#8221; said Khan.The actor known in India as &#8220;King Khan&#8221; or simply &#8220;SRK&#8221; to his legions of fans is arguably Hindi cinema&#8217;s biggest and most-recognisable star of the modern age.He shot to stardom in the mid-90s as the hero of romantic dramas such as &#8220;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&#8221; (&#8220;The Bravehearted Will Take Away the Bride&#8221;) and &#8220;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&#8221; (&#8220;Something Happens&#8221;).Khan is also known for lead roles in high-octane thrillers like &#8220;Don&#8221; and this year&#8217;s &#8220;Fan&#8221; while other major hits include the 2013 comedy &#8220;Chennai Express&#8221; and 2010&#8217;s &#8220;My Name is Khan&#8221;, in which he played a man with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome.&#8211;AFP
