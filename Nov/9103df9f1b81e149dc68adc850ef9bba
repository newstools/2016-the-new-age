Nursing students are being warned against falling prey to private institutions who continue to offer nursing programmes despite being phased out by the South African Nursing Council last year.The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) yesterday said it had been inundated with complaints from nursing students who said they were unable to write their South African Nursing Council (SANC) examination this month despite having done well in their courses.The institutions apparently offer the phased out courses under the false pretence of pre-nursing courses and dupe students into believing that they will have a guaranteed spot in the nursing programme. Some students have been misled into paying to secure their spots in the nursing programme.Enrolled nurse and enrolled nursing auxiliary programmes previously offered at SANC accredited private nursing institutions have been phased out. However, some institutions continue to illegally offer them.Denosa urged nursing students who may have fallen victim to those institutions to report them to the Nursing Council.The union has called for a robust campaign against what it calls the illegal and fraudulent practice by previously SANC accredited institutions. Denosa would like to caution parents and students who are doing matric this year to be aware of this and not register their children for the old legacy enrolled nurse and enrolled nursing auxiliary courses, the union said. We call on all community leaders, students and any other organisations to spread this message as more children could be affected in the months to come. Sanc said under the Nursing Act of 2005 it was illegal for an institution to offer nursing courses if it was not accredited and to offer programmes not accredited by the council.A warning posted on the SANC website advised students to make sure institutions of their choice were accredited.Lerato Dialeleratod@thenewage.co.za
