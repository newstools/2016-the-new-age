England&#8217;s prospects in India were in doubt after their dismal tour of Bangladesh but the touring side proved themselves by running their hosts close for a draw in the opening test, captain Alastair Cook said on Sunday.India captain Virat Kohli remained unbeaten on 49 in a tense final session to deny England, who fell four wickets short of clinching a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.Cook and his men landed in India with bruised egos, having lost the second test in Dhaka inside three days to settle for a 1-1 share of the series against Bangladesh, the world&#8217;s ninth-ranked test team.However, they scored four hundreds in the match against world number one test side India and looked like the only team who could force a win in the contest.&#8220;We probably proved to everyone else that we can play,&#8221; Cook told reporters. &#8220;I said at the beginning of the tour that we have got some very talented players.&#8220;Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali, for example, and Joe Root is world class. The hundreds we set up, obviously it was a good toss to win, but the way we played to get 530 showed the character on a different wicket.&#8220;To score those runs was very pleasing and then we did 160 overs of hard graft to keep India below us. We did a lot of very good things, just couldn&#8217;t quite get over the line.&#8221;England had lost 10 wickets in a session in Dhaka, exposing their frailties against spinners on turning wickets.With India boasting the world&#8217;s top-ranked bowler in off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, Cook admitted before the start of the series that his side were the underdogs.&#8220;As a group after what happened in Bangladesh I keep saying that if we play on those wickets we need to readjust,&#8221; said the 31-year-old, who scored his 30th hundred in tests on Sunday.&#8220;On these wickets, it takes a bit of time to turn and it was pretty flat to start with.&#8220;I am confident we will score the runs and confident we can bowl well enough to put India under pressure if we hit the same standards.&#8221;It was Cook&#8217;s sixth test hundred against India and he declared his team&#8217;s second innings on 260-3 to set India an improbable target of 310.Asked if England could have declared earlier, Cook said he did not want to give their opponents a sniff at victory.&#8220;Batting sometimes to just survive knowing you will never get the target is a lot different than chasing 260-270,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Maybe a braver person would have set 240.&#8221;-Reuters
