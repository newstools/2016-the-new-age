Pupils at the Kimberley Islamic School will be participating in the KFC mini cricket kids vs Proteas tour at the Newlands Cricket Stadium in Cape Town on December 8.The competition programme started in 2010 with 114000 children nationwide, 8774 coaches and 5584 schools enrolled.This time around, the programme visited the Islamic school and brought with them the former South African cricket captain, Graeme Smith, to the school.Smith said that they wanted the pupils to have an opportunity to go to Newlands Stadium and surround themselves with some of the best players in the country.He said they wanted the pupils to come to the grounds and interact with the Proteas.When asked if he had identified any potential, he said: It s not easy to identify the potential in such a short time but what I can tell you is that the pupils are enthusiastic about the sport. There are many more schools we have visited where the skill levels have been high. Smith said that there were 114000 mini cricket players in the country and could not possibly absorb every one of the children in the Proteas. However, what we wanted to do through this KFC mini cricket kids campaign is to build a support base and to ensure that people remain enthusiastic about cricket, he said.Smith said the children who participated in the challenge had been known to form friends faster, were more confident and had self-respect.He said that sport could also teach children to help each other and resurrect those values that were needed in many homes across the country.The chief executive officer of Northern Cape cricket, Eugene Jacobs, said they had been able to actively support the children participating in the mini cricket since the fast food company came in to sponsor the sport.Jacobs said that they had 14000 pupils participating in mini cricket in the province who lacked nothing as a result.He said that the company provided the children with equipment and the only thing the schools needed to organise was the transport.Jacobs said the programme covers all the regions in the province and has managed to ensure that all are resourced. We are hopeful that with the resources the children have, they will make us proud when they arrive at Newlands next month, he said.-NOMUSA MVUBU
