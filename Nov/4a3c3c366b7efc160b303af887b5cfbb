DA provincial leader Andrew Louw said financial management at Gamagara local municipality was a challenge that to be needed to dealt with.Louw was speaking during a sitting of the Northern Cape provincial legislature in Siyathemba last week.He said what stood out was the poor management of municipal accounts by the Gamagara authorities. He said the situation was causing unfair disconnections that resulted in the health risks posed since 2014 by the overflow of sewage at pump stations in Boekenhout and Sishen.But the Gamagara municipality has rubbished the allegations as unfounded and untrue.Though the municipality conceded to the slow delivery of accounts, it said that the Post Office had at some point experienced a bottleneck because of a shutdown. It also said out that accounts were now reaching consumers on time and that everything was being done to correct the situation. The municipality is working 24/7 to address all account queries from the individual cases reported, spokesperson Kamogelo Semamai said.Louw had said that there was also a reduction in the liquidity ratio of the Gamagara municipality over the first two quarters of 2016, which had a negative impact on the municipality s ability to settle its debts. An appeal was made to the standing committee on public accounts and the portfolio committee on cooperative governance to ensure that financial management and administration at the municipality improves, Louw said.He said during the next legislature meeting, the DA would again address issues related to the municipality s debt and arrears owed to service providers including Eskom. He said there was also the irresponsible mismanagement of conditional grants, as shown in the latest financial statements of the municipality and the quality of refuse removal in Kathu, which frequently causes more littering.He also raised the issue of wastage of water as a result of leaks and the failure of the municipality to maintain municipal infrastructure while the region experiences a severe drought.Semamai said that the problem of leaks does occur at times. Once in a while as a result of aging infrastructure or burst pipes, leaks occur. The other challenge is at certain pump stations where foreign objects are thrown into the system by consumers, the pumps burn out and need repairs or replacement, Senmamai said.He said that the municipality was working around the clock to spot and fix problems.Nomusa Mvubu and Charlote Hlangwanenomusam@thenewage.co.za
