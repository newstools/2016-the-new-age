Cosatu will take the national minimum wage panel report back to the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) for further deliberations.Cosatu national spokesperson Sizwe Pamla yesterday said that while the trade union federation welcomed the release of the report by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa s appointed panel of experts tasked with setting the actual amount of the wage, it still had misgivings about the proposed figure of R3 500 a month. The federation will go back to Nedlac and engage with the contents of the report and also push for a speedy resolution of these negotiations, Pamla said. While the proposed figure of R3 500 still falls short of the federation s proposed figure of R4 500, we note that the proposals by the panel are not a resolution taken at Nedlac, but are recommendations which still need to be deliberated on. Pamla also lashed out at the national Treasury s ominous warning about implementing the proposed figure. The Treasury said this week that the wage, if implemented, would kill more than 700000 jobs. This country s national Treasury seems to be either ignorant of or is deliberately ignoring the historical reality which this administration is supposed to transform. Among others, this is understood by their flawed and biased research and their provocative and misleading reaction to the advisory panel s report, he said.Pamla said Cosatu believed the panel s report could not be dismissed in its entirety. Cosatu rejects the narrow shortsightedness of those who want this report rejected in its entirety on the grounds of one or two components they don t like, he said.Pamla said the national minimum wage should pave the way for new wage policy. A meaningful national minimum wage must be an important element of a new wage policy which begins to recognise the dignity of every worker in our society and overcomes the legacy of apartheid wage structures, he said.BONOLO SELEBANO bonolos@thenewage.co.za
