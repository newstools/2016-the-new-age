Wits University is expected to release a report this week into its probe of rape allegations and the conduct of its officials in dealing with the rape complaint.Wits vice-chancellor Adam Habib appointed reseacher and analyst Nomboniso Gasa to investigate the university s officials in their responses to the rape complaint laid last month. She will investigate whether certain staff members of the university may have conducted themselves in a manner which does not comply with the university s policies and is inconsistent with the university s ethos. Recommend any action that should be undertaken to ensure that the university s structures are responsive to the needs and concerns of victims of rape, sexual harassment and gender based harm, Habib said.Last week female students voiced their anger and frustration at the alleged lack of urgency to deal with rape by tertiary institutions following the rape of a female student at Wit s Junction Residence.Students said that the victim tried to commit suicide last week as she lives in the same residence as the person who allegedly raped her three weeks ago.They said their attempts to get to the perpetrator were prevented by private security.In a series of posts on social media, student activist Seadimo Tlale said after being raped the victim wanted to commit suicide as the perpetrator stays in the same building. His name is ***** *****. Look after yourself. Protect your friends. We are not safe, she said.The rape allegations have raised concerns for the safety of thousands of female students, as about 500 cases of gender-based violence including rape have been reported at residences in the last five years.Two weeks back, a University of Cape Town serial rapist was handed nine life sentences.He was arrested in March in connection with the rape of five women a few metres from the UCT campus between November 2015 and February 2016.Last month a second-year female student at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University was raped, brutally assaulted and left for dead.The attack came two months after Emergency Medical Services student Thabani Ngwekazi 28 was killed and his 21-year-old girlfriend raped when they were hijacked outside the Varsity Park student residences in North End.In September, a University of KwaZulu-Natal student also claimed to have been raped on campus after police raided the institution at the beginning of the 2016 #FeesMustFall protests.Earlier this year students across various institutions raised the issue of rape on campus and claimed that the universities sexual violence policies were not working.-Batandwa Malingo
