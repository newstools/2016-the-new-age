At least one person was killed and 30 injured in a blast outside a police building Friday in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir, the centre of the Kurdish minority, medical sources told AFP.The local governor&#8217;s office said in a statement that the cause of the blast &#8220;seems to be a car bomb used by members of the separatist terrorist organisation&#8221;, a reference to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers&#8217; Party (PKK).Two local residents told AFP they had seen a minibus explode outside the police building in the Baglar district.AFP
