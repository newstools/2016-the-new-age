The provincial government is unhappy that Saldanha Bay had not been identified as a port for the importation of natural gas in the preliminary information memorandum (PIM) released last month by the Department of Energy (DoE).Now, economic opportunities MEC Alan Winde has requested a discussion on this contentious issue and has written to national Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson.With the release of the PIM on October 3 the platform for South Africa s gas to power infrastructure development had been laid. It was also a governmental effort by the minister and the Department of Energy to ensure that the country had an affordable, sustainable and secure supply of energy.Winde said no details were provided on the department s plans for the 600MW allocation of natural gas in the region that Joemat-Pettersson gazetted in May. There are many good technical reasons why Saldanha Bay should have been chosen for Phase 1 and the economic benefits for the province s region are enormous, Winde said. Natural gas will drive industrialisation in the province and put the region and country as a whole on a greener path. Minister Joemat-Petterson must share with us plans to give effect to the 600MW determination and suggestions for how we can partner to work together on this and other opportunities for the province, he said.The country, through Eskom, intends procuring 3 726MW gas of which 3000MW will be allocated to the Liquefied Natural Gas Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme to power the IPP procurement programme.The first phase of the programme will focus on Richards Bay in Kwazulu-Natal (2 000MW) and Ngqura (Coega-1000MW) in the Eastern Cape. The department will allocate 3000MW between the two ports. I have written to Minister Joemat Petterson requesting further engagement for the provincial government to be afforded an opportunity to engage on the decision to exclude Saldanha Bay from Phase 1. This is in order to provide us with more detailed reasons and the document that formed the basis for the decision and for investors to be allowed to tender for any of the three ports in the request for qualification process, Winde said.He said they looked forward to working with the national government to achieve a sustainable and affordable energy supply, including the opportunities which could be delivered by the province.Vincent Cruywagenvincentc@thenewage.co.za
