Emotional tributes were paid Wednesday to the Brazilian football team Chapecoense Real that was virtually wiped out in a plane crash in the Colombian mountains that killed 71 people.The charter plane, a British Aerospace 146, reported electrical problems just before the crash as it arrived in Medellin where Chapecoense were to play in the Copa Sudamericana final.But a Colombian military source said the airliner may have run out of fuel. &#8220;It is very suspicious that despite the impact there was no explosion. That reinforces the theory of the lack of fuel,&#8221; the source told AFP.The weather at the time of the disaster was bad.Six people miraculously survived the crash Monday night. Three of the survivors were footballers, but goalkeeper Jackson Follmann had his right leg amputated, said the San Vicente Foundation Hospital outside Medellin.Two flight crew and a journalist following Chapecoense for the game against Medellin also escaped.Brazil ordered three days of national mourning for the team.Fans flocked to the Chapecoense stadium in Brazil to mourn the team, who have emerged from nowhere over the past two years to take South American football by storm.Other Brazilian clubs have offered them players so they can carry on competing. Special funds have also been set up.Football legends Pele and Maradona and current superstars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo led tributes to the Chapecoense team.-AFP
