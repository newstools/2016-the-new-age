Former public protector Thuli Madonsela dropped a bombshell yesterday when she confessed to leaking audio clips of her state capture interview with President Jacob Zuma to a local television news channel last week.Madonsela told news channel ANN7 that she made the decision to make public recordings of her interview with Zuma on state capture allegations, before she left office. She said this was not to try and prove that the state had been captured but to prove that she had given the president a chance to respond to the allegations.Madonsela said at that time Zuma had already told the nation that as the public protector she had treated him unfairly by not affording him the opportunity to respond to the allegations surrounding state capture. I was the Public Protector until the 14th of October this year, and as the public protector, I made a decision to make the report public, not as evidence of state capture, but as evidence that I did give the president a chance to respond. You will recall that by the 14th the president had already told the nation that he is taking me on application for an interdict, because I had not given him due process, said Madonsela.On Monday, the presidency asked Public Protector Busi Mkhwebane to investigate the leaking of the audio recording.The interview between Madonsela and Zuma was aired by the TV channel just days after the final State of Capture report was released. The presidency has sought clarity from the Office of the public protector on the policy of the institution regarding the release of audio recordings of interviews conducted during the course of investigations.
