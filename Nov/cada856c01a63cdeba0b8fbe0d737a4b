Suspended ANC Western Cape leader Marius Fransman has on Friday alleged a plot, funded to the tune of R10m, is underway to dislodge himself and President Jacob Zuma from leadership.The ANC national disciplinary committee (NDC) announced it had suspended Fransman for five years following a hearing that he did not attend.However speaking to ANN7 on Friday, an upset Fransman hit back at his detractors, who he believes are part of a plot to discredit him, whom he says include Secretary General Gwede Mantashe.Fransman also said that Louisa Wynand, who accused him of sexual harassment was &#8220;lying&#8221; and was being used as part of factional political battles.According to Fransman, a number of people had been approached in the Western Cape with money to submit false statements against him.&#8220;There is a person named Jan Pretorius who came on 15 August to confess&#8230;what they tried to do at the beginning of the year,&#8221; said Fransman.He further alleges that a group of Gauteng business men are behind the well funded plot to get rid of him as well as President Jacob Zuma.Fransman alleges that a number of people within the ANC interested in regime change, were the chief funders of the faction which opposed him.&#8220;No one should believe that a comrade who serves the movement for so many years in a senior position can be treated so because it creates mistrust in everyone else,&#8221; continued Fransman.Announcing the suspension on Thursday, the NDC said discipline was the glue that held the ANC together. It said Fransman did not attend the disciplinary hearing nor did he show remorse for his conduct.However Fransman alleges that despite repeated attempts to engage with the NDC to provide him with documentation relevant to his case, he was constantly rebuffed by the NDC.ANC spokesperson Khusela Sangoni on Friday declined comment saying if Marius Fransman had any issues it would be beneficial for him to raise such matters within formal structures of the ANC.
