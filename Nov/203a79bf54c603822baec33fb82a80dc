When it comes to sexual fantasies, many have fessed up on wanting to get down and dirty on the back seat of the car or a quickie in the changing room. But did you know what tops a hot-blooded man or woman&#8217;s carnal desires? A steamy encounter with a stranger! Yes, save that blush because casual sex is here to stay. Ask anyone who&#8217;s toyed with the idea and they&#8217;ll say that the combined sense of the forbidden and adventure is what makes it so enticing. However, the prudes can take heart as a new research has something with which they can turn around and say, &#8216;I told you so&#8217;.What men regret v/s what women regret Would you believe it if you were told that what men regret most about casual sex is that they consciously avoided any future contact with the sexual partner? Yes, that&#8217;s true. Women, predictably, were wracked by guilt of having been too easy or quick to have jumped into bed with a stranger.Says sexologist Nivant Goenka, &#8220;Men are known to avoid intimacy and leave as soon as they are through with having sex. And how women react after casual sex is completely based on the quality of sex, not the quantity.&#8221; Seconding Goenka, counsellor Kapil Mehra adds, &#8220;There&#8217;s still something about a woman&#8217;s sexuality that the society is scared of. However, when it comes to men, it&#8217;s different as they have been brought up in a certain manner. But men do think that a casual encounter could have converted into a meaningful relationship.&#8221;Although men in our country have been granted more sexual impunity than women, there is a segment that does not follow the &#8216;wham-bam-thankyou-mam&#8217; philosophy. In fact, some try to keep in touch with the women they&#8217;ve had hook ups with. Ragini Sootha (name changed), an event management executive, is vociferous about generalisations. &#8220;It is not really true that men only want to hook up and women only want a committed relationship,&#8221; she says.Mehra, however, points out that those who tend to indulge in casual sex are often commitment phobic and therefore, it&#8217;s not surprising that they resort to ghosting.It ain&#8217;t all that bad The age of &#8216;swipe right&#8217; has opened up a veritable supermarket for casual sex. Says beauty blogger Pritha Khurana (name changed) who uses dating apps and has indulged in casual sex a couple of times, &#8220;One of the most positive things that has come in the wake of these fast-dating apps is that they have thrown out dated notions of branding women indulging in casual sex. In fact, it has also crashed the beliefs that it will destroy us.&#8221;Seconding her is Kunal Purohit (name changed), an advertising professional. He says, &#8220;Relationship or not, casual sex helps you break-free, makes you feel wanted, and satisfies your physical urges. There&#8217;s nothing wrong in it.&#8221;What research says&#8230; Findings of a new research state that many have ended with feelings of regret after a casual sex encounter. They wished that they had not acted on impulse. But what&#8217;s even more interesting are the reasons attributed to it it varies from gender to gender. While it&#8217;s true that there&#8217;s a cauldron of emotions running through a person&#8217;s mind the reasons leading to casual sex depend on the gender of a person. It could be anything from the need to be comforted, a feeling of worthlessness, rejection, shame, guilt, frustration as well as a feeling of revolt.Types of casual sexAfter-party crash An opportunity to have a steamy session with a stranger opens up after you&#8217;ve partied hard and are a few drinks down.
