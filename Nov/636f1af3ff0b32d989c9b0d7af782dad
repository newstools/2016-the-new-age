This article is the first is a series on the state of miningQ: Anglo American closed down a mine in Thabazimbi last September, when was the final decision to close down the mine taken?Kumba Iron Ore Limited, a business unit of the Anglo American group, commenced a consultation process on June 16 last year in terms of section 189 of the Labour Relations Act, through its subsidiary Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd, as part of closure procedures at its Thabazimbi mine in Limpopo.Q: What led to that decision?Kumba s decision followed an extensive review of the Thabazimbi mine and was in response to a combination of factors that affected the mine s economic viability.These include the following: the mine is more than 80 years old, and has over the past 15 years had its closure postponed 6 times through a number of mine life extension plans, difficult mining conditions due to the inherent geo-technical complexities now exacerbated by a limited remaining iron ore resource, very high operating costs due to high waste stripping requirements and a slope failure on June 6, 2015, which has rendered the iron ore resources in the one remaining pit uneconomic to mine.Q: When did the mine actually start operating?The official opening was on 28 March 1931.Q: What was it producing?Thabazimbi is an iron ore mine, producing lump and fine products.Q: How much of that did it make over the years?Kumba is a member of the Anglo American plc group that came into existence when the iron ore assets of Exxaro Resources Limited, formerly Kumba Resources Limited, were unbundled and listed separately on the JSE in November 2006.Herewith the figures of the total final production each year since 2006 in metric tons per annum:2006 2.4Mtpa2007 2.7Mtpa2008 2.7Mtpa2009 2.5Mtpa2010 2.0Mtpa2011 0.9Mtpa2012 0.8Mtpa2013 0.6Mtpa2014 1.1Mtpa2015 1.4MtpaTotal = 17.1MtpaQ: In monetary terms how much did the group make out of it when it was active?From 2001 to 2013 Thabazimbi was a captive mine for ArcelorMittal SA (previsouly Iscor and Ispat Iscor). It operated on a cost +3% basis.Q: How many people did it employ?The closure of the mine will impact approximately 800 employees and 360 contractors.Kumba conducted extensive consultations and agreed a ramp-down plan. Based on this plan, employees will leave the mine in tranches based on the activities the mine will cease based on the execution of the ramp down plan. This ramp down plan is estimated to conclude by end June 2016, when rehabilitation activities should commence.Q: Is there no activity at the mine as we speak?A closure function was held on November 27, 2015, as the first group left on November 30, 2015. Plant operations were expected to continue until April 2016. The rehabilitation team officially started work on December 1, 2015, and the hand over process started.Production and dispatch activities were planned to finally cease in the second quarter of 2016.Q: Who took the decision to shut the mineThis was a decision of the Kumba and SIOC boards. It required many on-going robust consultations and engagements not only with the board but with our parent company Anglo American and all other relevant stakeholders.Q: It is known that every miner has about 10 dependents. How has this affected them?More than 40% of permanent employees at Thabazimbi are close to retirement with significant experience that could benefit the developing industries in Lephalale and Thabazimbi municipalities.Kumba has developed a social plan to minimise negative impacts, optimise positive ones and respond on an ongoing basis to stakeholder concerns, issues and expectations.Q: How was the message about the closure of the mine relayed to the miners?Kumba had an extensive communication plan in place to inform employees. The message was relayed to Thabazimbi employees by general manager Vusi Maseko at Thabazimbi on June 16, 2015, followed by a consultation process in terms of section 189 of the Labour Relations Act, through its subsidiary Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd.Q: What role did unions play in the process?We consulted the unions and continued to do so throughout the process. Our consultations were constructive and measured. Unions were aware of the difficult climate under which the mining sector operates in general and which Kumba and Thabazimbi mine were faced with in particular.Kumba ensured a CCMA facilitated process to ensure a transparent and fair process. Our lines of communication remain mutually open and supportive of the best possible outcome through this process. Kumba continues to engage with the government at all levels, unions, Chamber of Mines and other stakeholders to ensure we navigate this tough global market together, striving to contribute to a resilient, sustainable mining industry for South Africa.Q: What went into discussions/negotiations on severance packages?Kumba preferred a CCMA facilitated process to ensure transparency and fairness. Packages were determined by this process on a fair and reasonable basis reflective of years of service.Q: How has the action impacted on Thabazimbi as a mining town?Sustainability is integral to the way we operate to ensure we leave a positive legacy. We are mindful of the secondary impact a difficult and painful process such as mine closure will have not only on employees and their families but the broader community and local economy.Closure plans attempt to mitigate the impact of this process on the surrounding communities and local economy as far as is possible. Kumba Iron Ore is guided by statutory codes as well as by our own codes of conduct and compliance in the form. We always strive for win-win solutions, achieved through robust engagements and trade-offs to ensure that in the end, we achieve sustainable shared value.Q: Residents in and around mines depend on the mines for jobs, does Anglo American know what their ultimate fate has been?We attempt to reduce the impact of the current economic climate on our community initiatives as much as possible, with the understanding that the company s ability to deliver to the same extent as we have been in the past is impeded by the current business reality.Our approach is to address issues openly and attempt to resolve them through constructive dialogue and partnerships with all relevant stakeholders.Q: If so has anything been done to alleviate their plight?As part of our closure plan, Kumba is conducting a socioeconomic assessment toolbox process and will be working with stakeholders on closure and social plans. Closure is the best viable option and we would not be taking this course of action if it were not a sustainable, responsible decision with an overall positive effect on the long term sustainability and resilience of Kumba Iron Ore in a low price environment.Q: What would these be?This is still an ongoing process. Our approach is to address issues openly and attempt to resolve them through constructive dialogue and partnerships with all relevant stakeholders.Q: Are there any plans in place for the economic survival of these people?I think we have answered the reporter adequately in previous questions.Q: Is it possible that former employees could turn into zama zamas and try salvage whatever is still left in the mine?Our ore is extremely heavy and we do not foresee any employee being able to turn into a zama zama because unlike other mining it would not be practically possible.Kumba attempts to mitigate the number of redundancies, taking into account pressures in the Northern Cape operations, by offering where applicable: Staff redeployment from Thabazimbi operations to the broader Kumba operations through talent analysis and an assessment of deployment options and needs. Platforms where constructive conversations can be facilitated such as at Future Forum.Kumba are assisting affected employees through: Counselling. Skills development training programs. Job search support. Entrepreneurial business development support.Q: What is Anglo American doing for their employees safety?Safety remains our main priority and we will continue to ensure the safety of our employees even after mine closure. This will ensure that there is appropriate safeguarding of mining areas to prevent people injuring themselves. At Thabazimbi mine we had an encouraging safety performance in 2015 with only 3 lost time injuries recorded, the best across all the Kumba mines.Q: What has happened or will happen to the company s assets at the mine?Kumba will assess which assets: it can use as part of its rehabilitation plan transfer to its other mines or other mines in the Anglo group for use in its business sell remaining assets on a fair and transparent basis in line with Anglo American s group policies.Q: What nationalities were employed by the mine?Only South African citizens were employed at Thabazimbi mine.sellor@thenewage.co.za
