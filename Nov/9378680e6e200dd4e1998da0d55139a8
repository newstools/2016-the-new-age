Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak will take part in a rare rally to protest a bloody crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, an official from his office said Tuesday.The gathering, which will take place in an yet-to-be announced location on Sunday, will involve politicians, NGOs and &#8220;all concerned with the issue&#8221; the official told AFP, without giving further details.Last Friday, Malaysia summoned the Myanmar ambassador while around 500 Malaysians and Rohingya marched through a heavy tropical downpour from a Kuala Lumpur mosque to Myanmar&#8217;s embassy carrying banners denouncing the Rakhine &#8220;genocide.&#8221;Muslim-majority Malaysia&#8217;s Cabinet also issued a statement last week condemning the violence, an unusually strong criticism against a fellow member of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which has a policy of non-interference in member states.&#8220;The major gathering on December 4 is to express our concern over the violence taking place on the Rohingya,&#8221; Deputy Prime Minister Zahid Hamidi was quoted as saying by the Malay Mail Online on Tuesday.Chong Ja Ian, a political analyst from the National University of Singapore, said Najib&#8217;s appearance at such a rally will be &#8220;odd.&#8221;&#8220;During last year s migrant crisis, there was criticism but it was oblique and not to this level,&#8221; he said.The discovery last year of human-trafficking camps &#8212; and scores of nearby graves &#8212; first in Thailand and then over the border in Malaysia caused shock and revulsion in Southeast Asia.The camps are believed to have been used by people-smuggling syndicates who move large numbers of impoverished Rohingya out of Myanmar, where they face systematic repression, with most heading for Malaysia.Bridget Welsh, a Malaysia politics expert with Turkey&#8217;s Ipek University, said the planned gathering was &#8220;purely a political exercise&#8221; for Malaysian leaders.&#8220;These leaders are desperately trying to show their Islamic credentials as they are losing moral legitimacy at home,&#8221; she said.Violence in Rakhine &#8212; home to the stateless ethnic group loathed by many of Myanmar&#8217;s Buddhist majority &#8212; has surged in the last month after security forces poured into the area following a series of attacks on police posts blamed on local militants.A UN official has said Myanmar is engaged in &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; of Rohingya Muslims, as reports emerged of troops shooting at villagers as they tried to flee.But Myanmar&#8217;s new civilian government, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, has rejected the allegations.-AFP
