THE Department of Trade and Industry will host public consultations on the National Liquor Amendment and Gambling Amendment bills in the province from today until Monday in Ladybrand, Bloemfontein, Welkom and Kroonstad.The acting deputy director-general of consumer and corporate regulation at DTI, MacDonald Netshitenzhe, said the main objective of the roadshow is to gather comments and inputs on the draft National Liquor Amendment Bill 2016 and National Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. The main objective for this nationwide drive is to get public input on the bills and to conduct education and awareness on benefits and harm associated with gambling and liquor use. Both industries affect societies in a positive and negative way and the negative effects always outweigh the positive, Netshitenzhe said.He said the government is constitutionally required to involve the public in policy formulation in order to ensure that the laws approved have considered views from all affected. The government has to consider and respond to issues that affect society in a negative way, therefore, stakeholders, members operating in both industries, organisations that deal with social issues created by gambling addiction and alcohol abuse and the public at large need to be involved when formulating policy, Netshitenzhe said.He said today they would be in Ladybrand City Hall, tomorrow at the Indaba Civic Centre in Mangaung and on Thursday they would be in Welkom at Lemotso Primary School.On Friday they will be in Maokeng near Kroonstad at Sesoville Hall.-BECKER SEMELA
