 Mineral products were the biggest contributor to South Africa’s trade surplus of R6.7bn in September, data released by the revenue service, SARS, shows. The mineral products contributed R16.6bn, followed by precious stones which contributed R7.9bn. SARS yesterday said August’s trade balance was revised to a deficit of R8.96bn from the previously reported R8.6bn. “August 2016’s trade balance deficit was revised upwards by R320m from the previous month’s preliminary deficit of R8.56bn to a revised deficit of R8.88bn as a result of ongoing Vouchers of Corrections,” SARS said. It further said that exports increased from August to September by R9.05bn (10.1%) and imports decreased by R6.53bn (6.6%). Total exports for September amounted to R98.9bn. The cumulative deficit from January to end-September was R9.95bn, an improvement on the R37.19bn in matching nine months in 2016, SARS reported. Exports of gold, diamonds and other precious metals and stones jumped 37% from August to September, while imports fell 66%. The revenue authority said the trade statistics it published were subject to revisions as new information becomes available on an ongoing basis. According to SARS the February 2016 to July 2016 export figures had been adjusted by R23.9bn, resulting in the year-to-date trade balance being revised downwards from a R7.41bn trade surplus published in August to a R9.95bn trade deficit in September. “The R23.9bn adjustment is as a result of revisions to the gold exports by the South African Reserve Bank which supplies the gold export data to SARS. These gold revisions have been disclosed by the Bank in the September 2016 Quarterly Bulletin,” SARS said. It also said that the revisions related mainly to adjustments made for gold that was moved to facilities outside South Africa but with ownership of the gold retained by South African entities. Investec chief economist Annabel Bishop said the surplus was significant, as The Economist commodity price index rose both year on year and month on month, with the commodity cycle expected to have bottomed this year. “As global economic growth and global demand improves, demand for commodities will likely improve, raising prices and so boosting export growth,” she said.
