Little Everite Chauke s family were faced with arguably the hardest day of their lives yesterday.Their three-year-old daughter was washed away by floods on November 15 and it is believed that it s her body that was discovered next to the Jukskei in Buccleuch, Johannesburg, on Tuesday.The parents of the child, Shadrak and Cynthia Chauke, started off the day by reporting to the Johannesburg mortuary to identify the body of a child yesterday morning.They spoke with counsellors for the rest of the day as officials prepared for the possibility of having to inform them that the body is Everite s.She had slipped out of her father s arms when the branch of the tree they were using to escape the floods broke. At this stage we are not sure if it s her, family spokesperson Kgabo Rapala said. The family went for DNA tests and we are told the results will come out on Friday. Shadrak and Cynthia had previously said that the only way they could find closure was if they saw the body of their child.Gauteng residents, the Johannesburg city council, the provincial government and politicians were united in searching for the little girl, with police divers and emergency management services desperately combing the river and its banks towards Hartbeespoort Dam.Even President Jacob Zuma visited the family to offer his support on behalf of the nation.Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela said DNA samples from the parents had been sent to a laboratory for testing on Wednesday. DNA swabs were taken from the Chaukes at the mortuary and we will wait for the forensic experts to tell us who the body belongs to, Makhubela said.He said counselling was important so the family would be better prepared for whatever the outcome of the identification process might be.Meanwhile, most of those affected by the floods are still housed in churches, halls and transit camps where they are receiving relief support while waiting for a solution to their shelter needs.Kutullo Madishakutullom@thenewage.co.za
