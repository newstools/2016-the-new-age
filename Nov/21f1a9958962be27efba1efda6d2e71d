&nbsp;French driver Esteban Ocon will race for Force India next season after agreeing a multi-year deal, the Silverstone-based Formula One team said in a statement at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Thursday.Ocon replaces experienced German Nico Hulkenberg, who is moving to Renault, alongside Mexican Sergio Perez at a team co-owned by Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya and currently fourth in the championship.The 20-year-old is contracted long-term to Mercedes, Force India&#8217;s engine provider, and made his debut this year with the lowly Manor team as a mid-season replacement for Indonesian Rio Haryanto.&#8220;I&#8217;m still relatively new to Formula One, but spending half a season at Manor Racing has given me some valuable experience and I feel ready for this new opportunity with Sahara Force India,&#8221; he said.The Force India announcement leaves only Mercedes-powered Manor with a clear vacancy, although Swiss-based Sauber have yet to confirm Brazilian Felipe Nasr and Sweden&#8217;s Marcus Ericsson are staying.Renault confirmed Britain&#8217;s Jolyon Palmer on Wednesday with Haas set to sign Denmark&#8217;s Kevin Magnussen.Ocon&#8217;s promotion is likely to be seen as a setback for German youngster Pascal Wehrlein, the Frenchman&#8217;s more experienced Manor team mate and also the Mercedes reserve who scored a point in Austria in July.Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff made clear that he saw Ocon as a big talent for the future.&#8220;Esteban has the most impressive track record in junior formulae and he is an exceptional personality outside of the car,&#8221; he said.&#8220;It is a positive development for Formula One that talent wins over money and we will be seeing some of the most impressive youngsters fighting to make it to the top&#8230; over the coming years.&#8221;Ocon is one of several youngsters, including Red Bull&#8217;s Dutch teenager Max Verstappen and Wehrlein, to enter Formula One on talent rather than their financial contribution.The jury remains out on 18-year-old Canadian Lance Stroll, signed by former champions Williams for 2017, who is a promising talent but whose career has been bankrolled by his billionaire father.Ocon tested for Force India last year and expected a busy few months ahead.&#8220;It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been working towards my whole life and I intend to grab this opportunity with both hands,&#8221; he said.Mallya, whose business difficulties in India mean he is currently unable to leave Britain, said the team had been following Ocon for some time.&#8220;We ran him in the car last year during testing and his performance convinced us that he is more than capable of racing alongside Sergio,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;&#8211;Reuters
