Indian screen icon Shah Rukh Khan has starred in dozens of Bollywood blockbusters and is adored by millions, but there&#8217;s a movie he still dreams of making &#8212; one that&#8217;s a truly global hit.&#8220;I would like to be a part of that one Indian film, as an actor, as a producer, as a gaffer, as a sound recordist, as a production manager, whatever, which becomes famous all over the world,&#8221; Khan told AFP in an interview.&#8220;That&#8217;s my &#8216;Make in India&#8217; dream. I&#8217;ve had this since 25 years,&#8221; he added, borrowing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s much-trumpeted slogan for boosting manufacturing in the country.The Asian giant&#8217;s Hindi film industry churns out hundreds of movies every year, raking in billions of US dollars in ticket receipts, but is yet to release a blockbuster that really takes Western box offices by storm.&#8220;I hope to achieve that but I don&#8217;t sit down with people (and focus on) &#8216;What is the crossover film that we can make?&#8217; No, I think it will happen because I believe in it,&#8221; said Khan.The actor known in India as &#8220;King Khan&#8221; or simply &#8220;SRK&#8221; to his legions of fans is arguably Hindi cinema&#8217;s biggest and most-recognisable star of the modern age.He shot to stardom in the mid-90s as the hero of romantic dramas such as &#8220;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&#8221; (&#8220;The Bravehearted Will Take Away the Bride&#8221;) and &#8220;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&#8221; (&#8220;Something Happens&#8221;).Khan is also known for lead roles in high-octane thrillers like &#8220;Don&#8221; and this year&#8217;s &#8220;Fan&#8221; while other major hits include the 2013 comedy &#8220;Chennai Express&#8221; and 2010&#8217;s &#8220;My Name is Khan&#8221;, in which he played a man with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome.&#8211; &#8216;I like James Bond&#8217; &#8211;The 51-year-old boasts 22.2 million Twitter followers and regularly sees hordes of admirers gather outside his mansion by the sea in India&#8217;s commercial capital of Mumbai, the home of Bollywood.His next film, called &#8220;Dear Zindagi&#8221; (&#8220;Dear Life&#8221;), hits cinema screens on Friday.But Khan admits he initially had misgivings about playing the role of Jehangir Khan in the comedy-drama directed by Gauri Shinde.&#8220;I&#8217;d be honest, I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like the film. Not because it&#8217;s not a good film&#8230; But it&#8217;s not my genre of film. I like bad boys. I like James Bond,&#8221; he said.Khan says his character plays the role of a &#8220;mentor, friend, philosopher, guide&#8221; to the much younger Kaira, played by upcoming Bollywood actress Alia Bhatt, 23, in the film which he says is &#8220;sweet&#8221; and &#8220;funny&#8221;.He described &#8220;Dear Zindagi&#8221; as a feel-good movie about life and how to cope with it &#8220;not only as a youngster but as a parent, as a middle-aged person.&#8220;It deals with all of them without being preachy,&#8221; he explained.Khan, whose career as one of Bollywood&#8217;s most bankable actors spans three decades, says he doesn&#8217;t see himself as a real-life mentor to young actors, but will give advice if asked.&#8211; &#8216;Out of body experience&#8217; &#8211;Khan has appeared in around 80 Bollywood movies and collected numerous accolades since travelling to Mumbai on a train from his hometown of Delhi in the early 90s with the clear intention of becoming a superstar.&#8220;I always wanted to be famous, I wanted to be recognised, I want thousands of people outside my house, I don&#8217;t want to go on the beach and relax. If I want a McDonald&#8217;s I&#8217;ll open it in my house,&#8221; he said.&#8220;When I was 25 I wanted to be like Madonna said: rich, famous, well-known, hard-working, recognised and get all the awards possible. I really enjoy being a star, I would not exchange it for anything.&#8221;In &#8220;Fan&#8221;, released in April, he played the double role of a movie megastar and a crazed young admirer whose obsession with his idol turns increasingly violent after he fails to meet him.&#8220;SRK&#8221; describes his own fame as being like an &#8220;out of body experience&#8221;.&#8220;I&#8217;m extremely grateful and I don&#8217;t even understand how I&#8217;ve become what I&#8217;ve become.&#8220;Does it even belong to me? I say this again and again, I&#8217;m just an employee of the superstar called Shah Rukh Khan. I have no idea how he does it.&#8221;-AFP
