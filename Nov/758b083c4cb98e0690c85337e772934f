Major changes enforced at Ajax Cape Town recently seem to be having a positive effect on the team.Following a streak of 10 losses, the urban Warriors eventually registered their first win of the season as they edged Platinum Stars 3-2 on Tuesday, hauling themselves from the bottom of Premiership log.But they are not out of the woods yet as they only moved to 15th spot with six points ahead of last night s Premiership fixtures.And the league log might have a different look by the end of the week.Early this week the club also announced Ajax Amsterdam legend Edwin van der Sar as a new board member with the aim of boosting the struggling side.Though newly appointed coach Stanley Menzo had to go for two matches without getting the desired results in the league, he finally put a smile on his face and the rest of the club when Ajax defeated Platinum Stars 3-2 at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium.Menzo was brought from the Netherlands to save what appeared to be Ajax s sinking ship.The victory this week will boost sagging morale.Goals by playmaker Bantu Mzwakali, last season s club top goal-scorer Prince Nxumalo and an own goal by Stars keeper Steve Hoffman saw the club moving to six points.Though still deep in the relegation zone, the victory saw the Urban Warriors moving from three points to six this season.When Menzo took charge of the club, the team had just logged just two points which placed the team at the bottom of the Absa Premiership table.In his first league match the coach oversaw a 1-1 draw with Free State Stars. They lost 2-1 to Maritzburg United last week despite a brave showing on the day.Though they lost, Menzo was excited with their performance and promised it was not going to be long before the team got positive results.Having registered his first victory, Menzo will be hoping that it will work as a huge morale boost ahead of their tough fixture against defending league champions Mamelodi Sundowns next week. We take it one game at a time and we are completely focused on winning. We shift focus to our next game at home against the defending champions, he said. We need to be a little bit smarter, read the game better and take advantage. Results will bring confidence. The Urban Warriors host Sundowns at the Cape Town Stadium next Wednesday.SITHEMBISO DINDIsithembisod@thenewage.co.za
