Workers at the power utility Eskom s Megawatt Park are demanding CEO Brian Molefe withdraw his resignation. The staff yesterday called an impromptu meeting at lunchtime and asked Molefe to reconsider his decision.Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said Molefe repeated what he had already said publicly that he had decided to leave the power utility in the interests of the company and good corporate governance. He emphasised that his resignation was not an act of admission of wrongdoing, it was rather what he felt was the right thing to do, Phasiwe said. The workers have however vowed to write to the Eskom board not to accept Molefe s resignation.Molefe has been adamant he would prove his innocence after being implicated by former public protector Thuli Madonsela in her State of Capture report into the alleged influence of the Gupta family in President Jacob Zuma s administration. I am confident that, when the time comes, I will be able to show that I have done nothing wrong and that my name will be cleared. I shall dedicate myself to showing that an injustice has been done by the precipitate delivery of observations , following an incomplete investigation, which the former public protector has drawn back from calling findings , he said. 701198
