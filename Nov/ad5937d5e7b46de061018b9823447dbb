No major surprises are expected when the Reserve Bank s monetary policy committee sits for its last meeting of the year to decide on interest rates, with most analysts pencilling in no change at 7% for the repo rate on Thursday.Friday may be different. That s when ratings agency Moody s publishes its country review.This has been one of the toughest years for SA households, facing skyrocketing debt and continuing price rises in food.However, projected deceleration in CPI inflation next year provides room for the MPC to maintain the repo rate at 7%.This will be the third time in a row rates are unchanged, after three straight hikes in November last year, January and March.The MPC has now raised its rate by 200 basis points since January 2014, including 75 points this year following a 50 point hike in January and 25bps in March this year.Consumer experts said the slow pace in the fall of inflation and the volatility of the rand including the possibility of the US Fed hiking rates next month has already led to a shift in investment flows from emerging markets to the US, hurting the local currency badly.These factors will likely deny consumers an early Christmas present in the form of a rate cut.Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago said the end of the hiking cycle could be in sight if inflation remained consistent with the latest forecast, but the bar for loosening policy was high.Inflation for September breached the Reserve Bank s upper target of 6% again, with food remaining uncomfortably high at 11.6% y/y, putting more pressure on lower income earners, and dashing hopes of interest rates cut this Christmas. According to the data, inflation quickened to 6.1% y/y, from 5.9% y/y while on a month-on-month basis, prices were up 0.2% after a 0.1% contraction previously.Food prices remain a significant driver of inflation given the persistent drought, but recent long-range weather forecasts and improved rainfall prospects are likely to soften things in the coming months. We remain of the view that inflation will nudge higher in the coming months, but should dip into the target range in the first quarter of 2017, Jason Muscat, FNB senior industry analyst, said. Peter Montalto, emerging markets economist at Nomura, also expects rates to remain unchanged, but with a still hawkish statement on the coming food price base effect.Kamilla Kaplan, Investec economist, wrote in her weekly forecast that projected deceleration in CPI inflation in 2017 would provide room for the bank to hold the repo rate at 7%.She said inflation was forecast to have risen by 6%y/y in October versus a prior 6.1% y/y and was expected to average 6% y/y in the fourth quarter of this year. The bank has noted that should these forecasts diminish to the better it may be close to the end of the tightening cycle, she said.bernards@thenewage.co.za
