The Department of Home Affairs has announced its partnership with the International Organisation for Migration (IMO) following the recent launch of the Mkhaya Migrants Awards recognising the contributions of migrants and building social cohesion. Fittingly, together with the IOM, we underpin our belief in how we envision that the occasion will reflect the aims of the African Union in its visionary document Agenda 2063, which details the African continent s development trajectory for the next 50 years, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba said. The partnership with IOM fits into our narrative to build healthy and prospering communities. We need to cultivate a culture of sustained dialogue and partnership action with immigrants within our communities. The department has partnered with IMO in running an essay and multimedia competition for students aged 18 to 30 at institutions of higher learning.They are required to write and essay or present a multimedia project on Why social cohesion is important in the country. 701478-TNA Reporter
