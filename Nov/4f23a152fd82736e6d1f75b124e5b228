Minister of Sports and Recreation Fikile Mbalula will be answering questions in Parliament on Wednesday.The questions he&#8217;ll be facing relate to transformation targets specifically, which of the five sporting codes that entered into the specified initiative in May 2015 have required Ministerial intervention and what have been the outcomes of the specified interventions.He will also be asked about the payment of performance incentives to the five local runners who finished in the top three positions of the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s division of the 2016 Comrades Marathon.He will also provide reasons for taking three months to pay performance incentives for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games medalists as part of the Ministerial Excellence Recognition programme.The payment of Olympics medallists culminated in a Twitter spat between Olympic Silver medalist Sunnette Viljoen and the Minister. Athletes were promised bonuses in addition to the R200 000 they would get for winning medals at the Rio Olympics.She accused the Minister of making promises he cannot keep, while Mbalula said that he has been abused by the athlete and her girlfriend. He also noted that she had demanded the money before it was even promised.School sports will also form part of the session&#8217;s questions, and how the department is dealing with challenges in carrying out sports development programmes at schools.He will also be asked about the Department&#8217;s Sport Focus School programme which was a platform for reinvigorating school sport. The programme will be put under the microscope questioning how many no fees schools for the poor, and unemployed benefit from it.
