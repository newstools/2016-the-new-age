Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will rise in the National Assembly to answer questions for the last time this year on Wednesday, December 7.He will have to answer six questions verbally, including ones from three party leaders Mmusi Maimane of the DA, the UDM s Bantu Holomisa and Kenneth Meshoe of the ACDP.Maimane has called on him to answer in the chamber whether he, as leader of government business, has managed to build a better relationship between the executive and the legislature and if he has succeeded in encouraging the selfsame executive to respond promptly to matters raised in Parliament.Ramaphosa s proposal of a national minimum wage of R3500 a month has seen Meshoe asking him, with reference to the different levels of inequality and affordability in South Africa, if the government has taken cognisance of whether the employer is a private person or a corporate entity.In his question, Holomisa said private employers, particularly those in the hospitality industry and agricultural sector, allegedly paid meagre salaries to foreign workers. He wants Ramaphosa to tell the country if the proposed national minimum will also cover them. He also wants to know if there is a plan to prevent South Africans from losing their jobs to foreigners.Three questions are from the ANC, given that he will be replying verbally to questions during the 16 Days of Activism for no violence against women and children, Ramaphosa has been asked what plans the government has to reduce the persistently high levels of HIV among adolescent girls and young women, as well as the unacceptable high levels of violence against women and children.Another ANC question relates to calls of unity between business and other stakeholders to promote investor confidence in the South African economy and if they have yielded positive results.A further part of this question, about the government s strategic economic interventions around job creation, also gives Ramaphosa an opportunity to talk about successes.The question about the outcomes of his recent visits to Vietnam and Singapore, particularly about the prospects of young South Africans being able to learn about and acquire skills in ship-building in Vietnam will also give him a platform to talk lavishly about developing learning opportunities for the youth.Dennis Cruywagennews@thenewage.co.za
