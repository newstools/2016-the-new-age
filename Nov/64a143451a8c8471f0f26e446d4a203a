THE mother of a two-year-old boy who was found wandering the streets of Kutloanong near Odendaalsrus almost two weeks ago has been released on a warning after she was arrested on Friday.Police spokesperson Capt Stephen Thakeng said the 29-year-old Kesenogile Khothule went to the police station on Friday after she was notified by community members who saw the story of her lost son in The New Age.Thakeng said the mother was immediately arrested for child negligence when she arrived at the police station but was released on a warning and allowed to take the boy home. We had to arrest her when she presented herself at the police station because we had a case of child negligence already opened because there was no missing person case that was reported at any of our police stations.She was taken to Odendaalsrus Magistrate s Court on Friday where she was released on a warning, Thakeng said.He said the boy was removed from the place of safety where he was staying and put in the care of the mother after she was released but the case remains open and the investigation is continuing. At the moment we can confirm that the child is with her mother and she has promised to take care of him. The boy was found by a community member at Block 4 in Kutloanong township almost two weeks ago.He was seen standing alone near a house and the owner of the house could not get answers when she asked him his name, where he came from and who he was.The woman walked around the neighbourhood in the hope of finding his family before taking him to the police station.Thakeng said they spent almost two weeks calling various police stations around the province to check if there was a case of a missing child reported.He said they suspected that the child was taken from somewhere else and dropped in Kutlwanong. We are appealing to parents and guardians to always look after their children, even when they are playing in the yard. The case of the boy surprised many residents, not only in Odendaalsrus, but in the entire province with fears that something may have happened to his mother.-BECKER SEMELA
