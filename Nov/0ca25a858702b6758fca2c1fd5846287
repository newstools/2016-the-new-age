Top US musicians took to social media Tuesday urging fans to vote after a presidential campaign in which celebrities overwhelmingly backed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Pop superstar Taylor Swift &#8212; who had been silent about the election &#8212; posted a picture of herself on Instagram dressed casually as she waited in a long line at a polling station.Although Swift &#8212; who performed at the 2008 Republican convention but generally stays out of politics &#8212; encouraged voters to come to the polls, she did not reveal her own choice.Katy Perry, often seen as Swift&#8217;s rival, is Clinton&#8217;s self-described &#8220;number one fan.&#8221; On Election Day, she posted repeatedly on Twitter, where she has nearly 94 million followers, more than anyone else.In one video, Perry appears with a fluffy little dog asking voters to head the polls.She also posted a commercial for Clinton set to &#8220;Roar,&#8221; in which a diverse array of Americans sway to her blockbuster tune, urging a &#8220;vote against hate.&#8221;Perry also waded into politics in her home state of California by supporting a proposition that would fully legalize marijuana. She linked to an opinion piece by rap mogul Jay Z, who argued that the failed US &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; has disproportionately targeted minorities.Jay Z and his wife, pop diva Beyonce, led a concert for Clinton on Friday in the battleground state of Ohio. Beyonce on Tuesday posted a short, cinematic video from the show to her 88 million Instagram followers.&#8220;So many people lost their lives for us to even have the opportunity to vote,&#8221; Jay Z said at the end of the video.It would be a &#8220;major disservice if we don&#8217;t go out and let our voice be heard,&#8221; he added.Rihanna also declared her Election Day support for Clinton, tweeting a selfie with a picture of the candidate on the chart-topping singer&#8217;s shirt, whose new dreadlocks dangled down.And Colombian superstar Shakira reached out to US Latino voters, who have been particularly offended by Republican candidate Donald Trump&#8217;s fiery calls to curb immigration.&#8220;The Latino vote can help decide the fate of a nation and the world&#8217;s,&#8221; she tweeted in English, adding, &#8220;Don&#8217;t stand still &#8212; vote now!&#8221;Trump, who enlisted few celebrity supporters, criticized Clinton for appearing with Jay Z and Beyonce, pointing to the rapper&#8217;s use of profanity.Trump nevertheless campaigned with hard rocker Ted Nugent, who grabbed his own genitals to illustrate his view of Democrats.-AFP
