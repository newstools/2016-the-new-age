Regardless of the recent heavy rains, dam levels in Gauteng are still low and residents have been urged to continue saving water.Rand West mayor Mzi Khumalo yesterday said that even though the recent rains had led to flooding in some areas, the drought gripping the country continues to have a devastating impact on humans, livestock and crops. Even though there has been some rainfall in the past few weeks, we are not out of the woods yet as the Vaal Dam levels are still not at the levels that can sustain consistent water supply, Khumalo said.He said all water users including business and agricultural sectors should reduce their consumption to be able to comply with the 15% (for residential users) and 20% (agricultural users) restrictions that have been gazetted. If we fail to make the required water savings, the consequences are too dire to contemplate as even more stringent restrictions will be imposed. As a solution, were exploring ways to work with the department of water and sanitation to purify the mine acid water as another source as we have an abundance of it in the disused mines. The Gauteng department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs, together with the department of water and sanitation and Rand Water is establishing a joint operational centre, which will also be responsible for, among other things, monitoring water levels, monitoring of water restrictions and any form of disaster management associated with the water shortage in the province.MEC for cooperative governance and traditional affairs Paul Mashatile said the sweltering heat and the lack of sufficient rainfall across the province posed an imminent danger of water scarcity.He called for drastic saving measures. If we are to secure enough water for each citizen amid this very real water crisis, we need to pull together and do every bit we can to save and preserve our water resources. The Vaal Dam levels are standing at 34.6% due to the release from Sterkfontein Dam in the Free State.Gauteng is expecting a heatwave this week which has a direct impact on the demand for water.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
