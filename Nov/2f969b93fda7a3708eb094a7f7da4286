Former Springbok assistant Coach Dick Muir on Friday said that South African Rugby is in Crisis.&#8220;It really doesn t look good for South African Rugby, what we&#8217;ve been dishing out as a product on the field is poor and our selections have been poor,&#8221; Muir said.He said that someone needs to take responsibility at South African Rugby&#8217;s head office where he asserts that there are problems as well, insisting that it could have a rippling effect down to the coaching and players.&#8220;My concern is that we not getting the selection right and if you not getting the selection right then your already on the back foot. I just think of a guy like Rohan Janse van Rensburg, he&#8217;s not starting. He had an unbelievable game against the Barbarians, he&#8217;s had a great season,&#8221; the former Bok assistant coach said.Muir also said that Italy have a great chance at beating the Boks even after the heavy 68-10 loss they suffered at the hands of New Zealand.&#8220;Italy have improved over the years, but for them to recover with the injuries they&#8217;ve got after being hammered by Australia will take a big ask for them to bounce back. I think this team is probably going into the game against Italy thinking what happens if we don t win here. That s a real concern for the Springboks and South African Rugby,&#8221; he said.He said that South African based players have to be given first preference as they would bring something different, rather than the old tried and tested personnel.Allister Coetzee meanwhile seems to place his faith in the tried and tested players, bringing back Bryan Habana in at Left wing and Nizaam Carr gets his first start in two years for the Boks.Replacement for Lock Eben Etzebeth will come in the form of Pieter-Steph du Toit who is the last of three changes in the team. It was the right decision not to risk Bryan at Twickenham. He has been training hard all week and without any discomfort, so he is good to go, the Bok coach said.Coetzee praised du Toit who he says has an impressive work rate and he expects him to deliver the same as the number 4 lock against a lively Italian pack of forwards. The coach said Carr was the right person to start in the No 6 jersey as he did well when he got the opportunity against England.The Springbok team to face Italy in Florence:15.
