WITH yet another R100 000 prize money promised for the more than 24 award categories, the 16th Annual Metro FM Music Awards on February 25 will make another big Durban splash in the new year.Yesterday, organisers launched the country s biggest music extravaganza with the theme, What s Next Is All That Matters, ahead of the 16th edition scheduled for the Durban ICC.The launch party was attended by the cream of the crop of the music industry and the media at the Hilton Hotel in Durban.Metro FM station manager Sibongile Mtyali said last year s success meant that the awards needed to keep up with changing times in the South African music industry while also positioning the awards as the premium music awards celebrating the best of SA music. We had a successful 2015 Metro FM Music Awards and drawing from our theme, the question is not about repetition, but what matters is what the 2017 Metro FM Music Awards have in store for the music lovers. The success of the MMA15 is something of the past, we can t keep blowing that trumpet, we have to sing a different tune in the next edition and keep growing the event and the artists involved with it, she said.Mtyali said the awards not only celebrated South Africa s musical talent, but also sought to promote Pan African cohesion and collaboration with our counterparts from the rest of the continent . We proudly support the collaborations between South African talent and the talents from the rest of the continent to form a distinctive continental sound, she said.It remains to be seen who will walk away with the biggest accolades and the fattest cheque as Emtee proved a hit last time in February, walking away with R400 000 after bagging the best hip hop, best remix and listeners choice album.-SIYABONGA SITHOLE
