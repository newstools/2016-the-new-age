Apple has released a book featuring 450 photographs of its products that chronicle 20 years of the company&#8217;s singular design.&#8220;Designed by Apple in California&#8221; includes products from the 1998 iMac to the 2015 Apple Pencil and is intended to shed light on the company&#8217;s design process, including materials and techniques, as well as its finished products.&#8220;This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years,&#8221; said Jony Ive, Apple&#8217;s chief design officer. &#8220;We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.&#8221;The linen-bound, hardbound book was developed over an eight-year period and is dedicated to Steve Jobs. It is available in two sizes priced at $199 and $299 and is being sold exclusively at Apple.com in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US, as well as at select Apple Stores. -Relaxnews
