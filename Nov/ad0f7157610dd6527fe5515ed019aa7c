Congress of South African Trade Union (COSATU) on Monday said it will engage workers in order to determine its position regarding the proposed R3500 minimum wage.Cosatu&#8217;s spokesperson Sizwe Pamla told ANN7 that whatever they are going to discuss in the Central Executive Committee(CEC) which starts on Monday, will be based solely on what workers want. If workers are comfortable with it, we will be able to take a decision on that but as long as workers say they are unhappy we won&#8217;t sign up to anything, Pamla said.Cosatu&#8217;s reaction follows Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa&#8217;s announcement on the proposed national minimum wage.Ramaphosa&#8217;s announcement came after he met with a panel of advisors whom had suggested an entry level of R3500.He said the proposed wage still needed to be discussed but emphasised that it was the most important process.The Deputy President also urged South Africans and all sectors to engage the proposed policy wage so that it can be implemented. The key question that all of us need to ask ourselves as South Africans is, where do you want to peg the national minimum wage, because it s a contradiction? You may want a high figure of R20,000 but you may wipe out a lot of jobs, Ramaphosa said.Meanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) were among those rejecting the proposed minimum wage saying it is favoring business at the expense of workers.The party&#8217;s spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the proposal will not assist the country in dealing with the high rate of inequality but it will instead be seeking to institutionalise the inequalities with low poverty wages.He said the EFF is following Cosatu&#8217;s proposal of R4500 that the federation tabled back in 2014 in Parliament, adding that the inflation has increased by more than 6% and that should now be set at about R5000.&#8220;Two years ago, business, in response to labour, had offered a counter proposal of R2700. This means the now proposed R3,500 is actually in favour of the initial business proposal since, taken the general rise in prices over the past two years, the amount comes to about R3,500.This is not shocking at all since it is Ramaphosa at the forefront of this process; and we know he loves money and business than he does the people, the EFF said in a statement.The EFF further said any wage that will be below R4500 will not make any difference to the lives of workers.-Sipho Jack
