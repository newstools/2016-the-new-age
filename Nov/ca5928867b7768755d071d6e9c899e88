The Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) is clamping down on individuals posing as students to cause mayhem at its Soshanguve campuses with more than 15 people arrested since Sunday.TUT spokesperson Willa de Ruyter said there were individuals who had no standing as students but were determined to derail the futures of 16000 Soshanguve campus students.She said 16 people were arrested at the Soshanguve campuses for public violence and contravening the court order obtained by the university. Security has been intensified to clamp down on any other offender. To safeguard students, staff and property, a curfew has also been instituted at the Soshanguve campuses between 6pm and 5am for the duration of the examination period, she said.De Ruyter also said no visitors would be allowed to enter or exit the Soshanguve North and South campuses between 5pm and 5am. The university remains steadfast in its decision to do everything in its power to protect the rights of all our students to complete this academic year. We also thank our students, staff and the SAPS for their commitment and support during the exams, she said.Students sat for their final exams at some campuses while Soshanguve campus students were transported by buses and escorted by police to the Tshwane Events Centre. TUT is pleased to report that students from all its campuses successfully sat for the first two days of the 2016 final examinations. Soshanguve students were transported to the Tshwane Events Centre without incident, following some delays experienced on Monday, she said.De Ruyter said the decision to go ahead with examinations, including for Soshanguve students despite threats to stop exams, was taken to allow the majority of students the opportunity to complete this academic year. What is particularly gratifying are the numerous emails and calls received from Soshanguve students, parents and other stakeholders since yesterday to thank the university for enabling students to sit for their final exams, De Ruyter said. Although the institution and the students reached an agreement to resume lectures, protests continued, although with fewer attendees.This was not long after student leader Lesego Phehla died after being hit by a car during the protests last month.The students were calling for free education following an announcement that fees would be increased for the 2017 academic year. 701647-Batandwa Malingo
