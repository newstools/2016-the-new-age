Pressure group TransformRSA yesterday became the latest organisation urging President Jacob Zuma not to sign the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill (Fica Bill) into law, saying: It is a dangerous piece of legislation for SA s democracy and sovereignty. The group said the law had the potential of harming the rule of law and protected rights enshrined in the Constitution.However, not enacting the Bill has ramifications as the country prepares for the next round of evaluations by the international body, the Financial Action Task Force, in 2019 when it assesses SA s anti-money laundering and counter-terror financing environment.The Fica Bill was passed by Parliament in May and referred to Zuma to sign into law. Many organisations have expressed their views on the matter, both for and against.The bill gives banks the power to perform due diligence tests on politically exposed people (PEPs) as part of their fight against terrorism, money laundering and corruption. This and other aspects are what are upsetting sections of the ruling party and others.TransformRSA spokesperson Adil Nchabeleng said yesterday they objected to the bill on two grounds. The provision on PEPs infringes on the rights of citizens as contained in the Constitution. Second, the provisions for risk management and compliance defy the constitutional right to due process and effectively pre-authorises banks and other parties to violate the legal principle of let both sides be heard . The bill would transfer criminal investigative, prosecutorial and judicial authority from law enforcement agencies and the independent judiciary into the hands of banking and financial institutions, he said.Other organisations opposed to the Bill include Cosatu, the Black Business Council and the Progressive Professionals Forum.In May, Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini said if the legislation was meant to curb corruption, everyone, including banks, should be subjected to it.The Banking Association of South Africa (Basa), which represents the country s biggest banks, has urged Zuma to pass the bill. We have full faith in the Reserve Bank and we are happy with the Bill. We have to abide by international best practice on money-laundering, MD Cas Coovadia recently said.Another group that supports the Bill, the Council for the Advancement of the Constitution in SA (Casac) , wrote to Zuma in September urging him to sign the bill into law or refer it back to Parliament within 30 days if he had concerns.Casac warned Zuma could face legal action if he did neither.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan told Parliament the amendments were necessary to fight money laundering and financial terrorism.Nchabeleng said the bill should be sent back to Parliament for further debate.Samuel Mungadzisamuelm@thenewage.co.za
