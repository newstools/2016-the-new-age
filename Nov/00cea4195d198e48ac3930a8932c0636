First class passengers on a recent Aeromexico flight were confronted by a slithery stowaway, in a jaw-dropping scene reminiscent of the tongue-in-cheek action film &#8220;Snakes in a Plane.&#8221;A university rector from Torreon posted video on Twitter of the unwelcome passenger snaking its way out of a an overhead bin and dropping into the cabin.&#8220;The flying viper, HA HA HA,&#8221; he joked.The mile-high stir was enough for air traffic authorities to give the jet &#8212; a domestic flight from Torreon to Mexico City &#8212; a priority landing.Animal expert Juan Carlos Gomez Juarez said it was clear from the video that the passengers were not dealing with a poisonous species.Nobody was hurt but a few passengers were upset. &#8220;It is just really common for people to panic when they see snakes,&#8221; said Gomez Juarez.Aeromexico said it was investigating how the snake wound up on the jet.-AFP
