Spingboks coach Allister Coetzee insists that the team the current Boks is the best available for this Saturdays match against the English.South Africa has played the England side 38 times since 1906 , with the Boks winning 23 times, losing 12 and drawing twice in a commendable head to head record.Coetzee lamented about the long list of injuries with the squad but believes they have selected the best for the clash against England. I believe we have selected the best available team for this Saturday . We have a long list of injured loose forwards, with all of Roelof Smit, Marcell Coetzee, Francois Louw, Jaco Kriel, Siya Kolisi and Sikumbuzo Notshe injured, while a couple are also unavailable for selection, Coetzee said.At Twickenham home of the English rugby union team, England is currently undefeated after 10 consecutive wins since winning their final Rugby World Cup pool match in October 2015.These factors are dually considered by the coach who called the home side the favourites, &#8220;but we are looking forward to another huge battle against them, Coetzee said. They are always formidable at Twickenham and matches involving our two countries have always delivered close fought encounters. They are an extremely well-coached side with no apparent weaknesses and their away series win in Australia proved why they are currently second in the world rankings,&#8221; Coetzee added.The coach is also concerned about the form that the team has displayed winning their last matches since the appointment of the English coach Eddie Jones.He also said that the tour can also be used to test various combination and rotation of players to ensure a move in the correct direction. The challenge this week will definitely start up front as the English pack paved the way for their series win over the Wallabies in Australia. It will be a physical challenge and the set-piece battle could prove to be the decisive,&#8221; Coetzee said.Meanwhile Eddie Jones has urged England to follow the example of Muhammad Ali&#8217;s celebrated &#8216;Rumble in the Jungle&#8217; bout against George Foreman when they face South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday .England are unbeaten in their nine Tests under Jones &#8212; a sequence that includes a Six Nations Grand Slam and a 3-0 series win in Australia.But they begin their end-of-year international campaign seeking a first victory over the Springboks since 2006, a winless spell encompassing 12 matches.Jones said taking the Springboks on at their own power game was the way to ensure another defeat against a side who, in the Australian&#8217;s typically vivid phrase, treat rugby union as a sport of &#8220;chess with steroids&#8221;.&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to go toe-to-toe with South Africa because that&#8217;s what they want to do, South Africans play the game like it&#8217;s a physical game of chess like chess with steroids,the challenge for us is to be tactically smart&#8221; Jones said.In 2007 Eddie Jones together with Allister Coetzee were part of the technical team that helped Jake White win the 2007 Rugby World Cup during is tenure as Boks coach.TNA Reporter with additional reporting by AFP
