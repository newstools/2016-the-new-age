Want to travel like Gwyneth Paltrow? The actress turned lifestyle guru has launched a revamped edition of her travel app under the rather cheeky name, G. Spotting.An extension of the City Guides section from her lifestyle website Goop, the mobile app covers about 25 cities with tips on little-known gems, restaurants, specialty shops, boutiques, hotels, and museums to visit.Aside from a few European capitals like London, Paris and Amsterdam, the app covers mostly US cities. Hong Kong is the lone Asian destination.Recommendations and suggested itineraries are sourced from Goop editors, locals, insiders and some of her celebrity friends like Reese Witherspoon and Tim McGraw.Guides are broken down into sections that include food, neighborhoods, classic and hipster to meet different travel personalities.In Paris, for instance, young, trend-conscious travelers looking to dine with ilk of their kind are advised to hit up hipster-friendly joints where words like organic, local, gluten-free, vegan and chia seeds are more likely to appear on the menu.These include restaurants and cafes like Glou, Cafe Pinson, Derri re and Bob&#8217;s Kitchen.New York is divided into neighborhoods like Midtown, Upper and Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, hipster capital of New York. One of the most densely populated destinations for hipster tourists? Brooklyn Bowl, a venue that includes concerts, bowling and restaurant dining.Paltrow is the latest celebrity to parlay her fame into the travel world.Rocker Ozzy Osbourne and his son Jack hosted a 10-part travel show called Ozzy &amp; Jack&#8217;s World Detour which began airing on the History channel this summer.Andrew McCarthy is an actor-turned-travel-writer for the esteemed &#8220;National Geographic Travel&#8221; publication.And Ashton Kutcher helped get Airbnb off the ground as one of the early investors.-Relaxnews
