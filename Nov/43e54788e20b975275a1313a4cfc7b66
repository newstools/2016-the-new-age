African higher education institutions have not as yet responded as well as they should have to the call made by Mwalimu Julius Nyerere 46 years ago, to successfully provide the intellectual and professional contributions to help our continent to achieve its renaissance.This is according to former president Thabo Mbeki who was accepting an honorary doctorate from the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania at the weekend.Mbeki said he was hopeful that the 46th graduation ceremony of the university would also serve as its commitment to continue to serve as a lodestar to be the kind of institution of higher education, which Nyerere spoke of in 1963 when he was the chancellor of then University of East Africa, of which the University of Dar es Salaam was a component.Calling him an outstanding African patriot and leader , Mbeki said the late Nyerere, who played a central role in the establishment and growth of the university, was their leader and guide in the struggle times. I first met Mwalimu Julius Nyerere in September 1962 in the then Tanganyika. That encounter took place at Dar es Salaam Airport as I was about to board a plane to fly to England to attend university in that country, Mbeki said.lillians@thenewage.co.za
