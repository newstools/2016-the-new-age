The same with Syria and Iraq,&#8221; he said, responding to a question on whether Egypt would contemplate a UN peacekeeping role in Syria.Asked by the interviewer whether he meant the Syrian military, Sisi, who has overseen a warming of ties with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s main he responded: &#8220;Yes.&#8221;Syrian security services chief Ali Mamluk made a surprise visit to Cairo in October and met Egyptian officials, in his first public foreign visit in five years.Sisi, who was elected in 2014 almost a year after overthrowing his Islamist predecessor Mohamed Morsi, has cracked down on Islamists and is battling a deadly jihadist insurgency.His government had been supported by billions of dollars in aid from Saudi Arabia, but ties appear to have cooled between the two countries amid disagreements over Syria.Saudi Arabia backs rebels trying to oust Assad, while Russia and Iran are supporting him militarily.Saudi Arabia suspended oil shipments to Egypt in October, a move announced after Cairo backed a Russian-drafted resolution on Syria in the UN Security Council, angering Riyadh.And while Egypt has on paper been part of a Saudi-led Arab coalition in Yemen backing pro-government forces against Shiite Huthi rebels, analysts say that behind the scenes, Egypt has been reluctant to engage.-AFP
