The fight to finally eradicate mud schools in the Eastern Cape remains a major challenge for the Department of Education.There have been regions that the department has developed but many more still remain, especially in the rural areas where there is a huge volume of underdeveloped schools with inappropriate learning conditions.Hundreds of pupils from Qokolweni Senior Secondary in Mthatha have had to endure learning in leaky and cold shacks for the entire year while newly renovated classrooms stand unfinished.Renovations at the school started in January but are far from completion. It is said that the construction company just stopped work around July and has not returned since.There are about six shacks behind one of the school buildings, which the pupils use as classrooms.The main concern is about the health and safety risks of the unfinished renovations to the school.Eastern Cape department of education spokesperson Mtima Mali said it usually takes more than 18 months to build a school unless they use alternative infrastructure where there are few pupils. We are working with the national department to eradicate this problem, Mali said.He said a list of schools to be built is received from the district, which decides on the urgency. After receiving the list from all 18 districts we then start building in the different areas. Eastern Cape spokesperson for road and public works Mphumzi Zuzile said they received the list of schools to built from the department. In the past financial year we had a target of five schools to build but only four were built, Zuzile said. Zuzile said that they did not reach their target due to poor performance and incompetence of the construction company that they appointed. This year s target is also five schools, he said. Schools that we have built are in Flagstaff, Port Saint Johns, and Butterworth. The national Department of Education has promised to build more than 190 schools this year and the Eastern Cape will provide 18 schools.Department of basic education (DBE) spokesperson Albert Gumbo said the Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (Asidi) is aimed at replacing those schools constructed from inappropriate material (mud, plank, asbestos) to contribute towards levels of optimum learning , adding that the bulk of the challenge remains in the Eastern Cape. In consultation with provincial governments, 501 schools were identified for replacement and since programme inception 170 schools have been completed, Gumbo said.The programme has been changing the landscape the length and breadth of the various parts of the province from East London to Lusikisiki, as well as Qumbu.Gumbo says a further 123 schools are at different stages of implementation with 54 of them set to be completed at the end of the 2016-17 financial year. It is important to note that due to the size of the Eastern Cape and population movements, the DBE had to embark on a rationalisation and mergers exercise in close consultation with the Eastern Cape s department of education so that viable schools could be designed, planned and built, Gumbo said.He said 216 schools have been affected by this exercise which involves delicate consultations with communities for reasons that are self-evident.Of these schools, 24 are closed while 14 have been addressed through other programmes.A total of 61 of the schools are geographically isolated and will, therefore, have to be built from the ground up while 91 have been identified for merging into 54 viable schools.Last month basic education through Asidi handed over a school worth R49m. This was Mxhume Secondary School in Ndindindi Village, near Lusikisiki, as well as Luxeni Secondary School in Manditshe Village, near Mthatha, which cost more than R22m.According to the department, the official handover will bring the number of schools built as part of Asidi since inception of the programme in 2011 to 177, with 133 of the schools built in the Eastern Cape.The initiative has provided water to 617 schools, sanitation to 425 schools and electricity to 307 schools that previously had no access to these basic amenities. Asidi s Albert Gumbo said the initiative continues to deliver a dividend of democracy to communities across the country .Gumbo said Asidi was providing state-of-the art schools for rural and urban underprivileged education to meet and, in several cases, exceed the minimum norms and standards for education infrastructure in South Africa. He said this level of investment in education infrastructure was unprecedented on the continent.SISANDA MADWANTSI news@thenewage.co.za
