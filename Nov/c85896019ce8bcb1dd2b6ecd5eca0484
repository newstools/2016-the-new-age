OR TAMBO International Airport has become the first in Africa to implement a smart security checkpoint that will digitise the security check process, speed up passenger progress through security and further enhance security through use of state-of-the-art scanners, the Airports Company South Africa said yesterday.The pilot implementation of the smart security system goes live tomorrow at the international departures security point at the airport.From tomorrow, departing international passengers will use the new system that includes a new conveyor system for checking hand luggage and new scanning booth for individual passengers.Bongiwe Pityi, the general manager of OR Tambo International Airport, says: There are only a few of these high-technology passenger security screening systems in use around the world, and we are leading the way in terms of enhancing both security and the passenger experience. Passengers will find that with the new system there will almost be no need for physical pat-downs of passengers who set off security alarms because the scanning technology is much better at detecting objects that should not be carried on or around the person, according to general manager.Pityi says the first change that passengers will notice is a security turnstile before entering the security area, where boarding passes will be verified electronically before passengers are allowed to proceed to the scanning area.There will also be less frequent requirements for laptops to be removed from bags and switched on-SELLO RABOTHATA
