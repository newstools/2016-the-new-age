&nbsp;The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has on Friday rejected Congress of South African Trade Union&#8217;s (Cosatu) endorsement of Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed African National Congress(ANC) President Jacob Zuma.Numsa said it disapproves of the decision of Cosatu&#8217;s Central Executive Committee (CEC) to support the ANC deputy president as the candidate ahead of the 2017 elective conference. Numsa has already put on record its view that Cyril Ramaphosa is an enemy of the working class. He has consistently attacked workers&#8217; hard-won gains and defended the interests of the exploiting capitalist class, most recently when he supported legislation to maintain poverty wages and the super-exploitation of Black and African labour under the disguise of national minimum wage at a level which will leave millions of workers in wage-slavery.&#8220;We have condemned his plan, to impose limitations on the right to strike and thus take away from workers a right enshrined in the constitution, while labour brokers are free to continue to exploit workers, Numsa said in a statement on Friday.The statement follows the federation&#8217;s CEC pronouncement on preferred ANC presidential candidate.&#8220;After an intense and robust debate, the CEC [central executive committee] has resolved to support and lobby for the deputy president of the African National Congress (ANC), Comrade Cyril Ramaphosa, to take over the reins as the next president of the ANC,&#8221; Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said on Thursday.Numsa&#8217;s General Secretary Irvin Jim however said: Worst of all, as a director of Lonmin, he was directly implicated in the massacre of 34 Marikana workers who demanded a living wage of R12 500. By now announcing a national minimum wage of R3 500 he is spitting on the graves of those workers who suffered exploitation until the oppressive agents of the capitalist state took their lives. He further said Ramaphosa made it a point that there was a property clause in the constitution which would keep ownership of the economy in the hands of South Africa&#8217;s white, racist, capitalist, colonial elite &#8211; with a few black faces like his being co-opted to disguise this retention of the status quo. Numsa&#8217;s General Secretary added that an ANC led government under the leadership of Ramaphosa will be no different.Despite Numsa&#8217;s disapproval the federation believes that Ramaphosa was the right candidate to lead the ANC out of its political gridlock .Ntshalintshali said although Cosatu did not enjoy voting rights at the ANC s elective conference, the federation would lobby the party s structures to shoulder support for Zuma.However, the ANC&#8217;s spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the pronouncement made by Cosatu and the leagues were not unifying the party.&#8220;The more pronouncements about leadership even before you discuss a set of guidelines simply divides the alliance and the ANC. I am not only speaking to Cosatu the leagues have been making their own pronouncements prematurely,&#8221; Kodwa added.Zizi Kodwa speaks on ANC NWC, veterans meetingJim said it will only seek to advance the white monopoly capitalism and to reassure credit ratings agencies that South Africa is a good place to invest and &#8216;exploit our natural resources and cheap labour&#8217;.He also took a swipe at Cosatu saying that the federation was stagnant and that it had no confidence in the working class as a locomotive force of history and as the most consistent class to pursue and champion class struggle as the only guarantee for change. Numsa is more convinced than ever that its revolutionary path of mobilising the working class to pursue a revolutionary agenda is today in the workers interests and we must struggle, while being very clear as workers and the poor that the capitalist system does not have solutions for problems that confront humanity, General Secretary added.In addition Kodwa said the ANC will not be forced to debate the succesion because of some members who were breaking rank. He further said ANC leadership ere meeting branches around the country to discuss the party s &#8220;set of principles&#8221; for leadership.-Sipho Jack
