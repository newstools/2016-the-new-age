While Rabada took 4/9 in his spell and has clearly introduced a fear factor that the Australian batsmen have been unable to overcome.He bowled 31 balls before he conceded a run on the morning with Australian captain Steve Smith taking 40 minutes to get off the mark.The the day/night Test at Adelaide, Australia provides the opportunity to complete a first ever clean sweep on Australian soil.&#8220;To get 8 wickets for 40 runs, is one of those sessions that we will always remember as a team. That one is this series and it was unbelievable, that ranks right at the top,&#8221; Proteas captain Faf du Plesiss said.&#8220;As a team, we know that coming here is an extremely hard challenge to come to Australia and beat a really good team,&#8221; added the Captain.Du Plesiss said that the results have been speaking for themselves and that the team has been very close to exceptional.&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been many things that have gone wrong, we&#8217;ve been consistent in the way we perform and a team that hasn&#8217;t relied on one or two persons all eleven are putting there hands up at different times in the series,&#8221; Du Plesiss said.&#8220;We are obviously a team that&#8217;s confident at the moment, we use that and we walk and talk that on the field. I feel our body language is extremely good,&#8221; Du Plesiss said.Man of the match Kyle Abbott also believes that confidence is the key, stating &#8220;we as a bowling unit know that they could perform as well as they did.&#8221;He mentioned his delight at being in the team and his resilience when he wasn&#8217;t selected.&#8220;I&#8217;ve always stuck at it, i&#8217;ve always did the work off the field, never let it get me down,&#8221; Abbott said.&#8220;To get an opportunity to play for your country is obviously the number one prize.I treasure every game , every situation I get into especially moments like this,&#8221; the star performer said.Meanwhile Cricket South Africa has congratulated the team for the win. With such impressive and emphatic victories, there are no words good enough to pay tribute to the team, CSA Chief Executive, Haroon Lorgat said.He said that the loss of their captain AB de Villiers, before the series even started and then experienced another big blow when attack leader Dale Steyn was lost. Barely a day into the series were set backs that they had to get through and still pull out all the stops to clinch the match. Faf du Plessis as our stand-in captain and our head coach, Russell Domingo, deserve special mention. They have now led the Proteas to seven successive victories over Australia across the Test and ODI formats and that is an incredible achievement,&#8221; Lorgat said. We now wish them everything of the best for our historic day/night Test match in Adelaide. A clean sweep over Australia in a Test series in Australia would give this team a deserved special place in our history. We can certainly look forward to a triumphant homecoming and then the upcoming home series against Sri Lanka, concluded Lorgat.
