Consuming an egg &#8212; nutrient-rich source of high quality protein &#8212; per day may lead to a 12 per cent reduction in risk of stroke, a new research shows.One large egg boasts six grams of high-quality protein and antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, found within the egg yolk, as well as vitamins E, D, and A, the study said.&#8220;Eggs do have many positive nutritional attributes, including antioxidants, which have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. They are also an excellent source of protein, which has been related to lower blood pressure,&#8221; said lead researcher Dominik Alexander of the EpidStat Institute, Michigan, US.For the study, the team conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies dating back between 1982 and 2015.They evaluated relationships between egg intake and coronary heart disease in 2,76,000 participants and stroke in 3,08,000 participants.&#8220;The study underscores prior research, showing the lack of a relationship between eggs and heart disease and now suggests a possible beneficial effect of eating eggs on risk of stroke,&#8221; added Tia M. Rains, Interim Executive Director of the Egg Nutrition Center &#8212; the scientific research arm of the American Egg Board.The findings were published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition.This article first appeared on Times of India
