JOSEPH Molefi, the owner of a tyre repair company in Barkly West, is one of the recipients of an investment boost by the Frances Baard district municipality.Molefi was awarded machinery on Monday night during the launch of Frances Baard Entrepreneur Week.Other recipients of machinery include Thabiso Ejindo, his brother Lebohang Ejindo and Jimmy Loff. Molefi said the machinery would help his business grow and he hoped to employ more people because of the boost. I m presently working with my wife;she markets the business while I do all the manual labour, he said.Molefi said the machinery would help with balancing and fitting and would operate as a truck tool. We used to rely on a third party to assist us with the business we offer to the municipality and with this machinery we will be able to do the job ourselves and cut out the middle man, he said.Frances Baard mayor Buyiswa Ximba said the district municipality wanted to do its part to develop the economy of the province through job creation.Ximba said the municipality wanted to look into alternative ways of creating jobs for the people of the district.She said the municipality had handed over the machinery during the entrepreneur week and wanted to bring together stakeholders to boost entrepreneurship.Representatives from Magareng,Dikgatlong, Phokwane and Sol Plaatje local municipalities were present at the launch.Officials from the Small Enterprise Development Agency, the National Empowerment Fund, the provincial department of economic development and tourism and the Industrial Development Corporation were also in attendance.Ximba said big companies were scaling down and it was encouraging to see entrepreneurs running their own businesses despite the many challenges. We also need to counter the impact that the mining industry has had on the job market and as a district municipality we will do whatever we can to assist aspirant entrepreneurs, she said.Ximba said there was a drop in the number of people who wanted to pursue their own businesses, which was a problem for job creation. What we want by boosting these businesses is to encourage SMMEs (small, medium and micro enterprises)to keep going, to keep fighting to grow their businesses. We need to do our part to ensure that we cut the high unemployment rate and there is no better way than to assist small businesses, she said.nomusam@thenewage.co.zaNOMUSA MVUBU
