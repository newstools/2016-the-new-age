The city of Johannesburg s Development Planning department warned residents not to take shortcuts when building or extending houses without approved building plans.The city warned that building without approval could be disastrous in the long run as the property owner could struggle to sell their properties or get the appropriate value for them. We encourage people to build backyard rooms and rent them out so they can make their properties work for them. All that we ask is that before you start building, draw up a house plan and come to us so it can be approved and your extensions legalised, Thabang Sithole, from the city of Joburg, said.The department has been hosting a series of open days to educate the public about its core mandate.World Town Planning Day or World Urbanism Day has been celebrated every year since 1949 in more than 30 countries to advance public and professional interest in town planning and to recognise and promote its role in creating liveable communities. If you do things the right way, you will avoid trouble with law enforcement agencies, Sithole said.Sithole said those who might have extended their houses without the city s knowledge or approval, could still approach the municipality to have their extensions legalised.Residents who want to open spaza shops in residential areas were encouraged to draw up a plan, obtain a trading licence from the Department of Health and submit both documents to the city for approval.Resident Muzi Ndaba, 52, said most people in the township built or extended their properties without house plans because they did not know there were procedures to be followed. This open day has been very informative. Now I know what I need to do to rectify the mistake that I made by building an extension without prior approval from the municipality, Ndaba said.Kutullo Madishakutullom@thenewage.co.za
