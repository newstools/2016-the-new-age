A PROBE into allegations of smuggling money out of the country against the Gupta family is being stifled by the Financial Intelligence Centre s (FIC s) refusal to provide crucial documents.The EFF laid a charge against the family following Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s affidavit filed in the North Gauteng High Court detailing red flags over the financial transactions of their businesses.The elite-crime busting unit accused the FIC of being disingenuous by its refusal to furnish detailed information regarding claims of suspicious bank transactions linked to the Oakbay Group.Gauteng Hawks head Maj-Gen Prince Mokotedi on Wednesday said they were stuck and unable to proceed with the investigations. After the charges were laid by the EFF and AfriForum, we requested FIC to give us information but they told us we don t have a prima facie case to obtain those documents. This despite several meetings we held with FIC officials who consistently told us that they could not give us a report because we didn t have a prima facie case that a crime was committed, he said.Mokotedi said he was worried that Gordhan was able to see those documents but law enforcement agencies are being denied access to them. We want to progress on all investigations into the allegations of state capture, he said.In July, FIC director Murray Michel received a request from Gordhan to provide him with information regarding the Guptas. I studied the request and I was satisfied there was legal merit and relevance as it relates to the centre s mandate, powers and functions, Michel said.The FIC said it shares the products of its analysis with a range of competent authorities including law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, SARS and supervisory bodies.The information shared by the FIC assists these authorities in discharging their responsibilities by, for example, enabling them to conduct investigations, prosecutions and the forfeiture of assets based on the leads supplied by the FIC.Mokotedi said he would write to the head of the FIC to resolve the matter. Last week AfriForum laid criminal charges against President Jacob Zuma, Ajay Gupta and more than 40 others, based on allegations by former public protector Adv Thuli Madonsela in the State of Capture report.The Hawks boss said investigations based on the public protector s report would continue.&#8211; PETER RAMOTHWALA
