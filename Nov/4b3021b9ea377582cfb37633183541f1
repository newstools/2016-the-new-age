Fees Must Fall leader Mcebo Dlamini&#8217;s bail application will be heard at the Palmridge Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Tuesday.Dlamini was expected to appear in court to conclude investigation with his trial scheduled for 15 November 2016.He faces charges of possession of a dangerous weapon, theft, assault with grievous bodily harm, malicious damage to property and public violence.Dlamini was arrested at the Witwatersrand University&#8217;s Junction Residence Complex in the early hours of 16 October 2016.In October, Dlamini was denied bail in the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court.Magistrate Albertus Roux said: It would not be in the interest of justice to release the applicant on bail. The Magistrate further labelled Dlamini as dishonest because he was made aware that he was not honest with the court.Roux said: the evidence in his affidavit is not convincing. The applicant was not always friendly and honest with the court. When Dlamini made his first brief court appearance, the state argued that he is a flight risk and might flee to Swaziland.His lawyer Mongezi opposed the state s request, citing he had tests to write at Witwatersrand University(Wits). It was however revealed that Dlamini is not registered at Wits.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale
