Barcelona manager Luis Enrique, whose side have made their worst start to a La Liga season since 2004, was pleased to top a tough group above Manchester City and Borussia Moenchengladbach.&#8220;It was quite a hard game and we expected Celtic to come out and make it difficult,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We were good at the back and we got better as the game went on. Messi, as usual, was at a very high level.&#8220;It was a very difficult group and it&#8217;s great to finish first with a game to spare.&#8221;Neymar appeared to be fortunate to escape with just a booking in the match, which will see him miss Barca&#8217;s final group game, as he pushed Mikel Lustig to the turf after the players had clashed.The Brazil star had earlier learnt that Spanish prosecutors are seeking a two-year jail sentence and a 10 million euros ($10.6 million) fine against him for his part in his allegedly fraudulent transfer to the club.He was subbed moments after clashing with Lustig, but his manager played down the incident.&#8220;It was just in the last five or 10 minutes that there was maybe a bit of an issue with Neymar with regards to the crowd shouting,&#8221; Luis Enrique said.&#8220;It was maybe just handbags with the Celtic player and nothing too special.&#8221;&#8211;AFP
