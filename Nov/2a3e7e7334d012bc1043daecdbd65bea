The question of fee-free education has always been a priority of our government.One has to accede though, that today, the fee-free education call is even more important than it probably was in the past, given the situation in our post-school education and training sector.Therefore, this calls every one of us to come together as South Africans to make time to contribute to the ongoing funding for the presidential commission of inquiry into higher education and training.There have been a number of platforms outside the commission, which continue to afford various voices an opportunity to share opinions and propose solutions.This must be appreciated and we need to continue encouraging more voices to come through as we seek a solution to the matter.The National Development Plan (NDP) envisages a robust education system covering early childhood development, primary, secondary, tertiary and vocational education as crucial for addressing poverty and inequality and also makes recommendations for policy makers on several fronts.Indeed, the NDP has guided a number of government policies, including the White Paper for Post-School Education and Training, which is also in line with other key national policy documents in the country, for example, the National Growth Plan and the Industrial Policy Action Plan.The White Paper also seeks to set out a vision for the type of post-school education and training we aim to achieve by the year 2030.Statistics South Africa says more than 3 million young people in our country are disengaged from education and work. The organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also says about one third of those aged 15-24, or 3.4 million people, are not formally employed nor in education or training. OECD says 2 million of these young people have not finished Grade 12.Without a doubt, these figures represent a profound challenge for South Africa and this certainly calls for a vibrant economy to respond to such challenges and, in particular, among others, a constantly responsive education system as envisaged in the White Paper on Post-School Education and Training.Our government has been accused, on a number of occasions, of not giving education the priority it deserves. In many instances our education system compared (well) with those in other developing countries such as Cuba.Let us look briefly at the Cuban education system. Early last year, Cuba reported a population of 11047251. The education system in Cuba is 100% subsidised by the government, meaning that Cuban students at all levels can attend school for free, the World Bank says.The World Bank s 2014 Report said Cuba has the best education system in Latin American and the Caribbean and the only country on the continent to have a high-level teaching faculty. The World Bank says Cuba allocates the highest share of its national budget, 13%, to education. The record of Cuban education is indeed outstanding and certainly one among other countries on which to benchmark.Do we not need to be honest though, with the South African reality and accept that the affordability of higher education in our country, given the economic conditions, will be a real challenge?Statistics South Africa recently reported that South Africa s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.3% quarter to quarter in the second quarter of 2016. This is in contrast to 1.2% in the previous quarter. Statistics South Africa said the year on year growth was 0.6%.The South African economy has been growing very slowly, Statistics South Africa says. This year s growth rate tells the same story as the last three or four years in terms of GDP growth.However, with all these challenges brought by the slow economic growth, the government still has to be commended for continuing to make funding available for higher education.The government has always been aware of these challenges and takes them very seriously.This year, Higher Education and Training received an additional 18% for 2016-17, with an average annual increase of 9.8% across the medium term expenditure framework period up until 2018-19.From R42bn in 2015-16, the Department of Higher Education and Training s budget is set to rise to R53bn in 2018-19.This means universities and students will receive an additional R17bn over the next three years as was announced by the minister of finance in the recent medium term Budget policy Statement in parliament.The R17bn includes the R7.6bn to universities to compensate for the fee-freeze for students whose families earn less than R600000 a year and another R9.2bn to bolster the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS).The Department of Higher Education and Training has, after an extensive consultative process, said the fee adjustment for the next year cannot be more than 8%.The government has this year provided R1.9bn of the R2.3bn shortfall resulting from the subsidisation of this year s university fee increase.More than R4.5bn in the 2016-17 financial year has been reprioritised to the NSFAS.This contribution by the government might not be enough to cover everyone, but it will go a long way in assisting the needy students.William SomoWilliam Somo is a communication and media liaison officer in the Department of Higher Education and Training.
