Americans go to the polls today to make decisions about free trade and the movement of people that are set to have significant long-term implications for the US and the global economy.Analysts say it appears as though a victory for Democrat Hillary Clinton, without full control of Congress, is likely.The markets generally would welcome Clinton and emerging stocks mostly snapped a four-day losing streak yesterday while currencies, led by the Mexican peso and the rand, sailed higher, thanks to renewed bets on a Clinton victory.Arthur Kamp, economist at Sanlam Investments, said policy differences between the two presidential candidates were significant. But, as a general observation, if neither the Democrats nor the Republicans take full control of Congress, policy changes are unlikely to be farreaching in the near term.Financial markets, notably the currency market, may show something of a response either way, but ultimately proposed legislative changes that have a meaningful, lasting impact on the economy are likely to take a long time to implement, said Kamp.TNA REPORTER
