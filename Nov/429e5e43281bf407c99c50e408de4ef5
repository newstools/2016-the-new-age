ANC Youth League President Collen Maine says the organisation has an obligation to defend President Jacob Zuma because ANC branches elected him as the leader of the ruling party.Maine was addressing delegates at the Youth League&#8217;s eThekwini Regional Conference in Durban.He called on members to protect the ANC leadership and President Jacob Zuma. We must defend the ANC and its leadership, now when we defend president Zuma, it&#8217;s not because we love him or we like him&#8230; We defend him because he is the president of the ANC, elected by the congress of the ANC. I might not have supported him like many other comrades, but once he&#8217;s elected he then becomes the president of the ANC. All of us have the responsibility to rally behind President Zuma whether they like it or not. We are not going to be told by monopoly capital. Meanwhile, Maine also reiterated that they want a female president to succeed Zuma.Although he did not mention specific names, some league regions have been outspoken about Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma stepping into the President&#8217;s shoes as the leader of the ANC. We must fight against sexism. There are those who believe that we can&#8217;t have a woman to lead the ANC and the Youth League&#8230; as a matter of principle we support a call for a woman president. -SABC
