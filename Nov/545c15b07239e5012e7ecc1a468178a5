&nbsp;Interest rates are likely to stay unchanged when the Reserve Bank s monetary policy committee (MPC) makes its announcement this afternoon, despite Stats SA reporting yesterday that inflation accelerated in October, pushed by food and fuel prices.The cost of living in South Africa went up by 6.5% (year-on-year) in October, up from 6.1% in September.This was also slightly above market expectations of 6.3%. Although this was still below the 7% seen in February this year, it did not bode well for consumers as inflation is expected to move noticeably higher over the next two months, before falling back into the target range of 3% to 6% during the first half of 2017.Six of the 12 sub-sectors the agency paid attention to in calculating the inflation rate remained unchanged while the six went up during the month.Food led the way, as SA consumers paid a substantial 0.9% more for food last month. Over the past year, food inflation remained uncomfortably high at 12%y/y, having been as low as 4.9% y/y a year earlier.That means food prices increased at more than twice the overall inflation rate within a space of two years. Further, consumers are paying more for fresh vegetables from 2.1% a year earlier in the same period to 14.8%, milk, eggs and cheese went up from 0.6% to 10.5%, bread and cereals from 0.4% to 16.5% and meat shot from 0.9% to 5.5%.The transportation index, which includes petrol price went up 0.7%, from 0.6%, after two consecutive petrol price hikes in August and September. Food prices increased meaningfully in the month, as did petrol inflation.The monthly increase in food inflation included a m/m rise vegetables, fish and a jump in the price of oils and fats. Although we still expect food inflation to remain relatively high over the coming months, we think most of the anticipated surge in food prices is now reflected in the data, Kevin Lings, economist at Stanlib said.However, Lings said the increase in summer rainfall suggested SA should experience a very welcome improvement in the agricultural season ahead. This should lead to a meaningful moderation in food inflation during 2017, which in-turn, will help to bring headline consumer inflation back inside the target range within the next six months. Christie Viljoen, a senior economist at KPMG in South Africa, said already the Food and Agricultural Organisation warned that the rise in food prices could add more pain to the estimated 14.3 million South Africans seen as being vulnerable to food insecurity at present.However, Viljoen said despite a spike in inflation rate in October, interest rate reductions are imminent in 2017 as inflation is expected to be within the target range of 3-6%. We expect the MPC to keep rates unchanged at 7% later this afternoon. BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@thenewage.co.za
