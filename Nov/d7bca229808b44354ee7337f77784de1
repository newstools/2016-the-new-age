Ahead of World AIDS Day, South Africa has launched a large-scale vaccine trial against HIV/AIDS in Cape Town on Wednesday.It is the first new HIV vaccine efficacy study in 7 years, with more than 5,400 sexually active men and women aged 18-35 in 15 areas around the country over the course of four years.Two volunteers from Durban, KwaZulu Natal were the first to receive the vaccine on Wednesday.&#8220;The study volunteers are being randomly assigned to receive either the investigational vaccine regimen or a placebo. All study participants will receive a total of five injections over one year,&#8221; NIAID says.&#8220;The vaccines do not contain HIV and therefore do not pose any danger of HIV infection to study participants,&#8221; NIAID adds.The vaccine trial (HVTN702) is designed to determine whether the regimen is safe, tolerable and effective at preventing HIV infection among South African adults.&#8220;The HVTN 702 study is a Phase 2b/3 efficacy clinical trial that aims to determine if an investigational HIV vaccine regimen is safe, tolerable and effective at preventing HIV infection among South African adults,&#8221; said the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID).Managing Director of NIAID Anthony S. Fauci said: For the first time in seven years, the scientific community is embarking on a large-scale clinical trial of an HIV vaccine, the product of years of study and experimentation. The HIV statistics for South Africa show that there is still a very high number of HIV related deaths.According to TBFacts.org, in 2015 the number of people who died from HIV related illnesses was 162,445 which was 30.5% of all deaths in South Africa.Furthermore, HIV statistics show that South Africa is the country with the largest number of people living with HIV. The number of people living with HIV has risen from 5.48 million in 2011 to 6.19 million in 2015. An estimated 34 million people live with the infection globally. World AIDS Day is held on the 1st December each year and is an opportunity for people worldwide to unite in the fight against HIV, show their support for people living with HIV and to commemorate people who have died.The day will be celebrated under the theme It is in our hands to end HIV and TB .-TNA Reporter
