The crushing majority that the ANC was looking for finally turned up in the House of Assembly to pass the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill.The missing ones, whose absence caused the Bill not to be passed last Tuesday and Wednesday because a quorum could not be attained, was in the ANC ranks which passed the Bill by 228 votes to 86 yesterday. There were no abstentions.The Bill was due to go to the National Council of Provinces yesterday afternoon for its consideration and passing so that the National Assembly s appropriation committee could begin processing the amendments.Just how important the Bill is was summed up last week by the Minister in the Presidency, Jeff Radebe, at a post-Cabinet briefing. He said: It is very bad for Parliament not to be able to pass what is essentially a budget because without a budget the government s programmes can never be implemented. The consequences are very bad. The passage of the bill vindicated ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu s prediction the party would have enough MPs in the National Assembly yesterday to avoid being embarrassed again.When he made that prediction Mthembu ordered MPs to attend yesterday s session.He declared that only those with valid reasons would be allowed to miss the sitting.The ANC s threats to discipline MPs absent without permission last week also saw to it the that the ruling party s benches in the House were packed.Although the Bill was passed in the National Assembly, its returning to the House yesterday has impacted the programme.news@thenewage.co.za
