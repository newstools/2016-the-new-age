Thanda Royal Zulu are not keen to let prized asset Mhlengi Cele depart. Coach Roger Sikhakhane made this clear after discovering that coach Steve Komphela and Kaizer Chiefs team manager Bobby Motaung were keen spectators when Thanda played AmaZulu in Umlazi on Sunday.Thr National First Division clubs shared the spoils (0-0) in the ill-tempered clash. It has emerged that the embattled Komphela attended the KZN derby to closely monitor Cele, who is the leading goal scorer in the NFD with 12 strikes. Chiefs coach must feel the need to strengthen his strike force since his strikers are firing blanks of late. But Sikhakhane put down his foot when asked about Chiefs intention to lure Cele away from them. Mhlengi is an important member of this team and I don t see him leaving us because we want to challenge for promotion, Sikhakhane said.Despite the drawn game, Thanda still lead the standings with 23 points from 11 matches. Meanwhile, AmaZulu coach Joey Antipas looked happy with the gutsy display produced by his charges. Usuthu have been struggling with consistency, resulting in the them sliding down the log. They occupy 10th spot with 11 points. The Zimbabwean coach missed three key players due to injuries. It was a pulsating game, a typical derby. The 0-0 result to be honest is not a bad result given the results we ve been getting. What we need to do is to build some consistency and considering we had about four guys out due to injuries and suspensions I thought the guys who came in put up a good show.
