At least 6 million people in Limpopo will no longer have to commute to Pretoria for court services following the official opening of the High Court in the province on Tuesday. People of Limpopo will no longer have to travel to Tshwane to receive services of the high court. When we are talking about the services, we are talking about the full services that we get from the court, said Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha.Masutha and Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng officially opened the court which started operation in 25 January 2016.#LimpopoHC pic.twitter.com/RX2g4f2n4p&mdash; The DoJ &amp; CD (@DOJCD_ZA) November 29, 2016Masutha stated that it is the very first court to be built by a democratic South Africa. There were only two provinces after 1994 which did not have their own dedicated courts which was Limpopo and Mpumalanga. So today we&#8217;re opening the high court for Limpopo and next year we will be doing the same for Mpumalanga, said Masutha.Masutha also indicated that the newly built Limpopo High Court has the potential to bring increased economic opportunity.The High Court, which cost R1 billion to build, has two blocks; block A which is the actual High Court building with six criminal courts and 11 civil courts, while block B houses offices of the State Attorney, National Prosecuting Authority, Master of the High Court, Legal Aid South Africa, the Family Advocate and the office of the Chief Justice s provincial centre.Chief Justice Mogoeng said with the new court, access to justice will be realised regardless of whether the person is rich or poor, white or black.&#8220;It never helps to build a court like this and not provide capacities to be able to deliver on promises held out to public,&#8221; said Mogoeng.#LimpopoHC pic.twitter.com/0nUMVke3zl&mdash; The DoJ &amp; CD (@DOJCD_ZA) November 29, 2016&#8211;Simangele Legodi
