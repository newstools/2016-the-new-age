On top of facing a charge of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act, EFF leader Julius Malema has been criticised for making racist comments, with AfriForum now exploring legal options.Addressing party supporters on Monday outside the Newcastle Magistrate s Court, Malema said he wanted to disturb white people s peace, that all land in South Africa belonged to black people and that it should be taken from whites without compensation.AfriForum deputy CEO Ernst Roets said his party was taking legal advice on how to react to Malema s comments.Malema also said that he was not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now . He further made various other statements against white people, Roets said. It is evident that Malema drives a populist agenda. His only priority is his own political career. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe also criticised Malema s utterances. We condemn in the harshest possible terms calls that incite racial hatred as those of the EFF, as they are an antithesis to the values of our constitutional democracy, which at its core declares South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity. But Black First Land First national convenor Andile Mngxitama called the charges brought against Malema baseless, vindictive and vexatious .TNA Reporternews@thenewage.co.za
