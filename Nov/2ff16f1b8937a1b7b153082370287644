Mushin Ertugral could be lost to South African football if he gets a new coaching job soon.The veteran coach told The New Age that he would be flying out of the country today to hold formal talks with teams in Dubai.He would then head to Istanbul to meet with clubs from his native Turkey at the weekend.Ertugral is without a job after leaving Orlando Pirates in a huff following an embarrassing 6-1 defeat to SuperSport United at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Limpopo three weeks ago. Some teams from Dubai and Istanbul enquired about my availability, hence I am attending to them, the 57 year old coach said. For now I can t tell you the names of those teams because it s not yet ready for public consumption. Ertugral said he was not approached by such clubs as Ajax Cape Town and Bloemfontein Celtic, which are yet to appoint head coaches.If Ertugral gets a job in Turkey, it will be the second time he ll be working in his native country. Apart from stints with South African clubs such as Kaizer Chiefs, Ajax Cape Town and Golden Arrows between 2002 and 2009, Ertugral also coached Turkish side Sivasspor.The veteran coach was employed by Pirates after an impressive spell at Mpumalanga Black Aces last season. But things didn t work out in Soweto as he only managed two wins out of six games. After seeing Pirates succumb to SuperSport in that 6-1 annihilation, Ertugral decided to throw in the towel immediately after the match.LINDA XIMBAsports@thenewage.co.za
