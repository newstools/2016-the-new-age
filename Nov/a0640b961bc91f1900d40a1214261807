The authorities are making good on their threat to punish those who fail to adhere to Johannesburg s Level 2 water restrictions.The city has issued more than 319 fines and 139 notices to residents who failed to adhere to the restrictions.Many of these offences were picked up after tip-offs received from community members.The Johannesburg metro police department is also enforcing the restrictions which have seen penalties of between R1000 and R1500 an offence.The city has experienced a high volume of water wastage in certain areas which continue to use large amounts of water despite the restrictions.Among the areas identified as the worst offenders are the residents of Waterfall, Witpoort, Westcliff, Parktown and Dunkeld.The biggest household water users live in Waterval, Midrand where each property uses about 159000 litres a month.The city said 40% of water in Gauteng was used for gardening which meant that reducing water consumption will not be too difficult as all they need to do is cut down on watering their gardens.Meanwhile, there have been major outages at two of the 96 points of supply from Rand Water in the past week. We wish to apologise to the affected residents. The reservoirs in question were Corriemore and Alexander Park. Corriemore feeds Northcliff, Fairland, Blackheath, and Berario. Alexander Park feeds Kensington, Malvern, Cleveland, Benrose, Bruma, Bezuidenhout and Jeppestown South, Anthony Still, mayoral committee member for environment and infrastructure services, said.He said in the case of Alexander Park, outages were caused by excessive demand which led to the reservoir running dry and difficulty in recovering the balance.Earlier this week the city of Ekurhuleni and the city of Tshwane embarked on Level 3 water restrictions.This involves cutting off the water supply between 9pm and 5am.Johannesburg has, however, taken the decision to stay on Level 2 restrictions at this stage. It is much better from an engineering point of view to keep a continuous supply in the system as this minimises bursts caused by water pressure. Many businesses depend on a continuous 24/7 supply. Having supply available at 5am requires valves to be opened much earlier and the consequent need to then bleed the system of air as water returns has concomitant operational risks, Still said.Ekhurleni has dismissed this as a problem saying they had taken measures to ensure that there were no disruptions to the supply system due to water shedding.Kutullo Madishakutullom@thenewage.co.za
