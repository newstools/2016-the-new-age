President Jacob Zuma has on Friday urged South Africans to build a society where women and children are safe everyday of the year and not only focus on their safety at this time of the year.Zuma was speaking at the National launch of the annual 16 Days of Activism which took place at the Lebowakgomo Civic Centre in Limpopo.&#8220;&#8230;this campaign should not run for 16 days only. We must together implement our decision taken in 2014, of running this case for the whole year, for 365 days of the year,&#8221; said Zuma.&#8220;We appeal to every citizen and everyone living in South Africa. Let us build a society where women and children are safe and feel safe,&#8221; continued Zuma.The President urged women not to be afraid to report perpetrators of violence and sexual abuse, even though most assaults of women happen at the hands of someone close to them.&#8220;We are losing more and more women at the hands of their violent intimate partners. International studies show that women often turn a blind eye to the violence in their intimate relationships or sometimes prefer to live in denial or disbelief,&#8221; said Zuma&#8220;The danger about living in an unattended violent relationship is that it intensifies over time until it leads to death.Violence against women has been declared a priority crime by government. Women must not be scared to report the perpetrators to the police,&#8221; continued Zuma.The 16 days of activism, which this year is celebrated under the theme &#8220;Count me in: Together Moving a Non-Violent South Africa Forward&#8221;, is a United Nations undertaking that is recognised worldwide from the 25th November to 10th December intended to generate awareness about violence against women and children.The President also spoke out harshly against the abuse of children.&#8220;As we meet already there are horrific tales of violent attacks, such as the gang-rape of a 13-year-old girl by 10 men in Nyanga, Cape Town,&#8221; said Zuma.&#8220;It is beyond comprehension that adult men can inflict such pain on a defenseless child. Other children are sexually molested at home by relatives in some cases. These are the types of incidents that should unite us all to say enough is enough,&#8221; continued the President.The African National Congress Women&#8217;s League(ANCWL) on Friday also marked the launch of the 16 days of activism also urging all South Africans to work together in dealing with violence on women and children.&#8220;Violence knows knows no gender or social status it affects us all. All our efforts are required in redressing violent acts on women and children,&#8221; said Women&#8217;s League Secretary General Meokgo Matuba in a statement.&#8220;As we begin the 16 Days of Activism of No Violence Against Women &amp; Children we should note that alcohol and drug abuse remains a major contributor in domestic violence and sexual offense actions, communities must join the fight against substance abuse,&#8221; continued Matuba.The ANCWL has called for the custom of Ukuthwala to be abolished saying it constitutes injustice to women and girl-children and is a violation of their rights and basic freedoms.The League also called on the virginity testing custom to be abolished.&#8211;TNA Reporter
