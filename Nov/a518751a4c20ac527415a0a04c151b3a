The African Development Bank has approved the first installment of a $1 billion loan to Nigeria to help President Muhammadu Buhari combat a &#8220;crisis situation&#8221;.In a Wednesday press release, the AfDB said that the $600 million loan was the &#8220;first tranche of a US $1 billion budget support loan&#8221; to help the West African country overcome a recession.&#8220;We must think through innovative solutions to support our regional member countries in crisis situations like this,&#8221; AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina said.&#8220;It will help the (Nigerian) government create fiscal space to facilitate a smooth implementation of the government&#8217;s budget, support fiscal and structural reforms, and improve the targeting of social sector spending,&#8221; the bank said, adding that the last tranche of $400 million will be approved in 2017.Buhari introduced a record budget designed to stimulate growth earlier this year, but has struggled to attract funding.On Tuesday, the Senate rejected his plan to borrow some $30 billion from abroad to finance key projects and plug budget deficits in the next three years.Nigeria&#8217;s gross domestic product is expected to shrink in 2016 by 1.6 per cent after slipping into a recession in August, according to the AfDB.The economy has taken a hit after the global price of crude &#8212; worth 90 per cent of its exports and 70 per cent of government revenue &#8212; crashed.Ongoing rebel attacks on oil infastructure in the country&#8217;s oil-producing southern swamplands have compounded Buhari&#8217;s headache, slashing production at a time the country desperately needs the money from the oil sector.Support for Buhari is slipping as a result of his handling of the economy, analysts warn.The president scored a 41 per cent approval rating in a September poll, compared with 80 per cent around the same time in 2015, said BMI Research, a London-based research firm, in a recent note.&#8220;Falling popularity and increasing criticism from influential figures and close allies will limit President Muhammadu Buhari&#8217;s ability to enact the hard policy decisions needed to take Nigeria out of its present macroeconomic morass,&#8221; BMI research warned.&nbsp;-AFP
