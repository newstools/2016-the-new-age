 Hands off our leaders, was the message from Limpho Hani, wife of struggle icon Chris Hani during a ceremony where she received the keys and title deed to Chris Hani s house in Dawn Park, Ekurhuleni from the city.She launched a scathing attack on the media for reviving claims about former president Thabo Mbeki s involvement in her husband s killing and warned ANC members that their enemies were at work. I want us to defend the organisation and not to allow our leader s name to be used in vain, she said. She took a swipe at a local daily newspaper which published excerpts from part three of the documentary The Derby-Lewis Disclosure in which a conspirator in Hani s killing, Clive DerbyLewis, made reference to rumours at the time of the SACP s and ANC s alleged involvement in the murder in 1993. What I found extremely offensive is the name of Mbeki is mentioned in the documentary. The story doesn t make sense. I am appealing to the editor of the paper not to sell their paper by taking our leader s name in vain, she said.Limpho expressed appreciation to the city for honouring her late husband by buying the house from private owners who had preserved the house as it was when the SACP leader was assassinated in 1993 to turn it into a museum. When you told me about the idea for the project, I did not know what to expect since I am a control freak but this is beautiful, she said.She said her wish was for all municipalities to follow Ekurhuleni s example and celebrate their heroes.NTOMBI NKOSI| ntombin@thenewage.co.za
