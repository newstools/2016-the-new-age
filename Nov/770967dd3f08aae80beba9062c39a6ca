Wits University s SRC has launched a scathing attack on the institution s handling of a recent rape complaint by one of its students.This as the university is expected to release a report on its official s conduct during and after the rape complaint was laid.The student was allegedly raped at Wits Junction residence three weeks ago and the perpetrator was allowed to continue to stay at the same residence as the victim. That, according to the victim s peers, prompted the victim to try to commit suicide.Incoming SRC general secretary David Manabile accused the institution of being complicit by allowing an environment for rape culture to thrive. The head of residences responded in a careless manner. His utterances were a depiction of the broad culture of victim blaming that permeates through university management. Damaging statements like they are friends , she invited him into her room , he (the rapist) is not a threat and the rape was not violent constituted a significant part of his problematic response, he said.Wits vice-chancellor Prof Adam Habib has appointed researcher and gender activist Nomboniso Gasa to investigate whether certain staff members of Wits may have conducted themselves in a manner which does not comply with the institution s policies and recommend action to be taken.Gasa is expected to release her report to the Wits community by Friday but the SRC s Manabile is not happy with Gasa s appointment. Wits University and its structures are the subject of this investigation, Adam Habib as the vice-chancellor forms part of this. We do not recognise this appointment as the Wits SRC on the basis that the body being investigated cannot be entrusted with the task of appointing a reliable and unbiased arbitrator, he said.Manabile said once a rape is reported the perpetrator must be removed from the residence pending investigations. University management must account for its continued failure to address sexual violence in practical terms. The SRC, All Residence Council (ARC), All Faculty Council (AFC), and all other relevant student bodies, must be involved in the creation and implementation of a new policy that will protect students, he said.The university said it would release the report before Friday and could not comment further on the matter until then.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
