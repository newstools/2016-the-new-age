Cosatu is to undertake a clarityseeking mission with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa s advisory panel that proposed a R3 500 per month national minimum wage.The trade union federation s general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said the labour constituency at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) will tomorrow get an opportunity to meet with the panel of experts that presented the proposal.This meeting is a precursor to a meeting of the Committee of Principles (COP), chaired by Ramaphosa, scheduled for early next month. We will seek clarity from the panel and there are a number of issues, such as the two-year implementation period and the concern for enforcement within that period. There will always be unscrupulous employers so there must be incentives for those who comply and stricter penalties for those not abiding by the law, Ntshalintshali said.He said without strict enforcement the whole exercise of implementing a minimum wage would be rendered useless. We as trade unions know that without enforcement it will be a useless exercise. There must be buy-in from all. The meeting comes in the wake of the panel, chaired by Imraan Valodia, having tabled the proposal to labour, business, government and community constituencies in Nedlac.Ntshlintshali said of the panel s proposal that wages in the domestic and agricultural sectors be set at 75% and 90% of the proposed national minimum wage, respectively: What led them to conclude on those numbers? For us those numbers are negotiable. There are many vulnerable workers. We need scientific proof that supports those numbers. Ntshalintshali said they would continue to push for a higher amount. A family of four will need R4 500, and that amount must be adjusted by inflation as time moves on. A comprehensive wage is needed to get people out of poverty. We ll formalise a position so that when we go back to the negotiation table, we have a clear understanding. BONOLO SELEBANO bonolos@thenewage.co.za
