Highlands Park coach Gordon Igesund says he will continue to assess veteran midfielder Surprise Moriri to make a decision on whether to sign him or not. Moriri has been keeping fit with the Tembisa-based outfit after his contract with Mamelodi Sundowns was not renewed in June.Igesund, who previously worked with Moriri at Sundowns, said should he feel the need to add the 34 year old to his squad, he will sit down with management to make a decision. He is doing his coaching course and at the same time he asked the club to train here and keep fit, Igesund said. When I came here, he was training with the club and I told him he can continue doing so. But I don t know of his intentions right now and I will continue to assess him and we will see what happens. Moriri spent 12 years at Sundowns and feels he still has one more year left to play at the highest level before hanging up his boots and hopes Highlands Park will add him to their roster. We know what he is capable of. He is a good player and any team would love to have him. We will see what happens in the upcoming week or so, Igesund said. There is no doubt he is a good player and his experience could come in handy for us. Igesund, meanwhile, said he is also assessing his squad to see if it can be strengthened in January. Igesund took over from Allan Freese last month and his mandate is to keep the club in the Absa Premiership. At the moment I m looking at what we have and, if need be, then I will speak to the management and see who we can sign in January. But now I have to look at all the players we have and see what they can do. Highlands Park are sitting 12th on the log with six points from seven matches and next play Golden Arrows in a league match at Makhulong Stadium on November 20.nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
