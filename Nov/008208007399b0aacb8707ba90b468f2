GAUTENG education is experiencing admission challenges, with more than 40% of pupils who applied for admission yet to be placed as the Department of Basic Education readies itself for the 2017 school year.Out of 297 505 applications received for grades 1 to 8, 173 051 have been placed, with 124 400 still waiting for placement. This as the deadline for late applications in Gauteng closes today. School infrastructure is one of the major deliverables that the department is paying special attention to given the complex challenges we face as a country.As part of the state of readiness the department prioritises the provision of ablution facilities and school furniture for pupils and teachers, predominantly in our rural areas, department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said.Gauteng education introduced an online admissions system this year, which initially had some glitches. The system first went live on April 11, but was suspended only hours into its running because it could not process the high traffic volumes.The placement was envisioned to be completed by the end of July, but due to the slow pace of parents replying to placement offers, the department said this process had been delayed.Mhlanga said school maintenance in terms of upgrading and rehabilitation of existing assets and the provision of facilities, where these have not yet been delivered, were being monitored. The Department of Basic Education works with provinces and districts to ensure that all the necessary work is done to ensure that learning and teaching takes place in a conducive environment, he said.snn4@thenewage.co.zaLILLIAN SELAPISA
