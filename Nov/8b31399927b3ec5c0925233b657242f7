Police Minister Nathi Nhleko is set to brief media on Tuesday on allegations of financial impropriety which have surfaced against him as well as reports of ongoing tensions between the Ministry and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID).Reports emerged on Sunday alleging that Nhleko had a hand in the awarding of a R30m tender to Nomcebo Mthembu, who happens to be his girlfriend.Mthembu&#8217;s company allegedly received payment for organising the We Are One Humanity workshops and events to raise awareness against xenophobia after violence against foreigners broke out in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng last year.The opposition Democratic Alliance(DA) has indicated it would be laying a complaint against Nhleko.The Minister is also scheduled to provide details about alleged frictions with IPID.The Police Minister recently wrote to National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete asking the legislature to initiate removal proceedings against the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate Robert McBride.In his letter, Nhleko said he was requesting a Parliamentary inquiry into McBride s fitness to hold office however the Democratic Alliance has charged that Nhleko is actually requesting the initiation of removal proceedings based on sections 17DA(3) to 17DA(5) of the SAPS Act, as read into the Ipid Act &#8220;Parliamentary proceedings, based on sections 17DA(3) to 17DA(5) of the SAPS Act, as currently read into the IPID Act, presuppose an intended end removal from office as opposed to being an open-ended process that could result in any outcome.For this to be just and fair, there would first need to have been a finding of wrongdoing by McBride which is currently not an established fact,&#8221; the DA said in a statement.The party said &#8220;allegations of misconduct on the part of McBride must certainly be tested to determine their merit.&#8221;However Nhleko s spokesman Sandile Ngidi on Sunday said it was irresponsible of the DA to accuse the Minister as it had done. There is an impasse between the Minister and the IPID head. Parliament needs to resolve it. There is a court order to that effect. It s quite irresponsible of the DA to try and ridicule the Minister, he said.Back in September the Constitutional Court determined that the Police Minister has absolutely no authority to summarily suspend McBride without Parliament instituting the necessary processes.Meanwhile Nhleko has been invited to give a status report on policing-related issues to the portfolio committee on police next Wednesday.-TNA Reporter
