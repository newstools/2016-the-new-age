There was joy and celebration at Bosugakobo Primary School in Dinokana village, near Zeerust when Tuelo, a 12-year-old disabled boy, received a new wheelchair.Tuelo is doing Grade 1 after he started school late due to his disability.He cannot walk and even when he started school earlier this year, the wheelchair he used was not in a fit state.The boy s life took a turn for the better the day he met local businessman and award-winning hiker Kagiso Legobe about three weeks ago.Touched by the boy s plight, Legobe started a campaign and mobilised his friends to assist in changing Tuelo s situation.The boy has now taken delivery of the new wheelchair and he looks forward to continuing with his education. I m very happy and I want to thank those who have assisted me, Tuelo said.Tuelo plans to be a teacher once he finishes his studies and the new wheelchair seems to give him a new resolve to dream big.The boy s aunt and younger sister were also in a jovial mood seeing him in a new and better wheelchair.Tuelo s parents are both dead.Kevin Rutter, from Fathers In Africa, donated the wheelchair and he said the story of Tuelo had touched him. I heard about the boy s situation from Kelebogile Moeletsi and immediately worked to get this wheelchair. It is a pleasure to be of assistance to Tuelo and I wish him the very best in life, he said.On her part, Kelebogile said that seeing how happy everyone was at the school awakened something in her that makes her feel happy. When I received a call from Kagiso on the desperate situation of Tuelo, I extended the message to my contacts and I m happy that we have managed to make a difference in the boy s life, she said. We realised that Tuelo is not receiving any grant together with the sister as they are orphans and Tuelo is disabled. There is a need to continue supporting them but what touched my heart was that he was out playing with other boys, showing them his new wheelchair, she said.Local leaders also thanked those who contributed in making Tuelo s situation a societal concern and urged for more of such spirit in the community.Legobe said that he felt happy that Tuelo was in a better shape now and ready to continue with his studies. To Kevin, Kelebogile and others who assisted, I just want to say thank you and may we not grow tired of doing good for the less privileged and needy, he said.Elfas Toreraielfast@thenewage.co.za
