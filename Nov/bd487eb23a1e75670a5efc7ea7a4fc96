Our selection is also keeping in mind of the process and necessity to build towards 2019, said Coetzee.Apart from rotational changes and injuries, some of the selections were made with the building process towards 2019.Coetzee said Uzair was impressive during our domestic competitions and he was man of the match in the Currie Cup final. He made a good impression during the build-up to the Barbarians match and has continued to work hard on this tour since re-joining us .He added Jamba, Uzair and Rohan are examples of players who have forced their way into the squad through consistently performing well on the domestic scene and during training on tour, and now they are getting their opportunities to play for the Boks. Even though Damian played well against England and Italy we felt Rohan deserved an opportunity.Coetzee expects a huge battle against the two sides he stated that the matches between the two teams have always delivered close fought battles.Boks assistant coach Matt Proudfoot says he expects Wales to come out strongly in the match.After a defeat by the Italians the Springboks will look to make a strong statement against the Welsh.Proudfoot anticipates the Welsh team to put pressure on them and thinks that they have a very good back with experience in the back line.&#8220;They attack with a lot of width they use a smart kicking game. We are expecting the Welsh to come out firing,&#8221; Proudfoot said.In training the assistant coach said that &#8220;you can see the players want to make a statement, we had to tamper into the enthusiasm and really focus on execution of certain aspects of our game.We need to improve this week. The major aspect we focused on is our break down and our continuity. We need to be more effective and efficient in our breakdown to generate quick balls.&#8221;The Boks lost to Wales in the 2014 outgoing tour at the Cardiff&#8217;s Millennium Stadium.
