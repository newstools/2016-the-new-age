Minister of Trade and Industry Rob Davies says the manufacturing sector is one of the reasons South Africa is not in recession and that it must be fully supported.Davies was delivering his keynote address during the launch of the Komani Industrial Park revitalisation in Queenstown in the Eastern Cape yesterday. He outlined the importance of the revitalisation of Komani Industrial Park by saying that more people need to take part in the manufacturing sector. Phase1 of the park has already created jobs for the locals, materials to upgrade the park were procured from local enterprises, Davies said.He said partnerships will have to take the Komani Industrial Park to a higher level as more work still needs to be done and people need to search for jobs while creating opportunities.Davies, Premier Phumulo Masualle and Eastern Cape MEC for economic development, tourism and environmental affairs Sakhumzi Somyo launched the first phase of the Komani Industrial Park revitalisation in Queenstown yesterday.The R22.5m project is part of the Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and Komani is one of the 10 industrial parks that the department has prioritised for revitalisation as part of the programme. The launch marks the completion of the first phase of the project, which covers security upgrading of the park and the DTI has been working with the Chris Hani Development Agency on the revitalisation of the Komani Industrial Park and an amount of R22.5m has been invested by the DTI so far, Davies said.He said the DTI has recognised that these parks have the capacity to aid as catalysts for broader economic and industrial development in their host regions, mainly townships and rural areas and the parks will promote industrialisation, manufacturing and job creation.He has already launched the completion of the first phase of the revitalisation of industrial parks in Limpopo, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal and Somyo said these provincial industrial parks will be key centres for employment creation and industrial development for the Eastern Cape. They will also serve as a launch pad for the black industrialists programme that seeks to promote the participation of black businesses in the manufacturing sector, Somyo said.Indie Boyceprovinces@thenewage.co.za
