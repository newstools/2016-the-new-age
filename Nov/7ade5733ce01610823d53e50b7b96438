ROYAL Eagles coach Kostadin Papic has put his players and management out of their misery by committing to his job at the National First Division side. The Serbian coach was rumoured to be on the wanted list of Bloemfontein Celtic, who relieved Serame Letsoaka of his duties two weeks ago. But Eagles goalkeeper Philani Zikalala has said Papic assured the team he wasn t going anywhere. The coach held a mini meeting with us after the training sessions last week. He quelled rumours that he was going to leave us. As far he is concerned he was determined to see out his contract and deliver on the mandate of promoting the team to the PSL in May. His statement motivated us and put us out of our misery since we were concerned, Zikalala said.The goalkeeper disclosed that their intention is to win automatic promotion. They occupy third spot in the standings with 18 points, just six points adrift of leaders Thanda Royal Zulu. As Eagles prepare for the trip to East London for the showdown with Mthatha Bucks, Papic and general manager Richard Makhoba explained why their two star players have not featured so far this season.The straight talking Papic reportedly said winger Masibusane Zongo is not good enough to warrant a place in the starting line-up. On Awol reports, Papic was noncommittal in his response and said the winger is expected back at training on Monday. On striker Katlego Mphela s absence, Makhoba said the former Bafana international is facing huge competition from Sedwyn George, Raymond Monama and Siyanda Ngubo.news@thenewage.co.za
