THE case involving African champions Mamelodi Sundowns and the SA Football Players Union has been postponed to November 28. Keagan Dolly s agent, Paul Mitchell, turned to the union after Sundowns allegedly blocked the midfielder s intended move to Greece. Sources close to the 23 year old revealed that Olympiacos FC tabled a R15m offer for Dolly but the reigning Absa Premiership champions apparently had a counter offer, scaring off the Greek side.In his contract, there is a buyout clause stipulating the player should be made available should an offer from a European club come up. The union s deputy president, Tebogo Monyai, said the case had been postponed to the end of the month. Dolly captained South Africa at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics and dished up scintillating displays that attracted interest from the Greek champions.Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says Dolly and Khama Billiat need more experience before they can play in Europe. But the attacking duo are rumoured to be on their way to Europe in the January transfer window. Speaking after the 2-1 win over Kaizer Chiefs at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria on Saturday, Mosimane said: Our players are young, with the exception of Vila (Sibusiso Vilakazi). But Percy Tau, Keagan, Thapelo Morena and Khama &#8230; I ve said it, Keagan needs one or two more years before we can talk overseas . He can go now because everybody wants him but he s not yet a product that s ready for Europe. Mosimane said it was difficult to retain players when European teams came knocking with big money offers. The former Bafana Bafana mentor believes South African players are slightly behind in terms of development, in comparison with their counterparts in the European leagues.sports@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
