The South African Domestic Service and Allied Workers Union (Sadsawu) has rejected the new minimum wage for domestic workers that comes into effect next month.Sadsawu general secretary, Myrtle Witbooi, said while the union welcomed the annual increases, they believed it was condemning workers to poverty. We reject this minimum wage, it s exploitative. It s ridiculous people are expected to work for the amount stated in the minimum wage. We recommended they receive more, she said.On Monday, the Labour Department announced the pay hikes. The department said there will be two sets of minimum wages for areas A which covers the metros and area B.The new minimum wage will apply to domestic workers, gardeners, housekeepers and nannies.Workers in area A working more than 27 hours a week will earn R12.42 per hour and receive R2422 a monthThose based in area B working for more than 27 hours a week will receive R11.31 per hour and earn R2205 a monthWitbooi lambasted the department for the different payment rates for workers in urban and rural areas. Domestic workers whether in the rural and urban areas do the same work, so why different wages? she said.Witbooi said many domestic workers relied on micro lenders to make ends meet because the bulk of their wages were spent on transport and food.Labour Department acting spokesperson Mokgadi Pela said: You must balance the demands of the workers and what employers can afford. Increases should not result in job loses. Pela said discussions were ongoing on the issue of the different rates.An affluent domestic worker employer, Stacey Lewis, said she paid more than the stipulated wages. As somebody who comes from a first world country, I pay her well. Lewis said.-Zodidi Mhlana
