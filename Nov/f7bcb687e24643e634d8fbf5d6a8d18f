Nathan Ake&#8217;s first-half header saw Bournemouth record their first away win of the season in the Premier League as they beat Stoke City 1-0 on Saturday.Victory was the south coast side&#8217;s first in three league games after they lost to Middlesbrough and Sunderland prior to the international break.Stoke, however, missed a great chance to equalise at the start of the second half when Bojan Krkic struck a penalty against the crossbar.The home side were fortunate not to be down to 10 men early on at the Britannia Stadium.Bournemouth saw a superb pass from Jack Wilshere, on loan from Arsenal, send Callum Wilson through on goal before he was brought down by Ryan Shawcross.Moments later, Wilshere&#8217;s shot was turned away by diving goalkeeper Lee Grant.Bournemouth broke the deadlock in the 26th minute when Ake, unmarked in the six-yard area, headed home Junior Stanislas&#8217;s free-kick.Stoke improved as the half wore on and it needed a goal-line clearance from Steve Cook to keep out Shawcross&#8217;s header before Ake blocked a goalbound effort from Wilfried Bony.Early in the second half, Australian goalkeeper Adam Federici kept the score at 1-0 by pushing away a header from Bony, with the rebound leading to a controversial penalty decision.As Bojan retrieved the loose ball, Bournemouth captain Simon Francis stepped on his foot and the Spaniard dramatically flung himself to the ground.He got up to take the ensuing spot-kick but smashed the ball against the bar.Bournemouth appeared content to play on the counter-attack.Stoke created few clear chances as they chased the game, with Xherdan Shaqiri shooting over the top from 12 yards out and Jonathan Walters heading straight at Federici.Wilshere almost set the seal on a fine individual performance with a goal, but the England international&#8217;s curling shot brushed the post.-AFP
