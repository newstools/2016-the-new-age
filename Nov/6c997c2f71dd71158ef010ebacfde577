Minister of Transport Dipuo Peters and senior government officials have welcomed the Constitutional Court&#8217;s decision on the Electronic National Traffic Information System (eNatis) on Wednesday.Minister said &#8220;this landmark judgement has drastically changed the legal landscape and confirmed that South Africa is indeed a Constitutional state where justice prevails.&#8221;In 2001 the Department of Transport appointed Tasima, a service provider, for the development, management and transfer of the eNatis system for a contract period of five years.In 2007 the Department duly informed Tasima that the contract will not be extended and that they should hand over the system to the Department and the decision was welcomed and accepted by Tasima and undertook to do the same and further undertook to oblige pending the decision and directive from the department for the handover.The handover never took place and Tasima continued to provide services on a month to month basis until 2010 when the contract was unauthorised, irregularly and illegally extended for a further five year period.Tasima has been given 10-30 days to hand over their services to the road Traffic Management Cooperation.&#8220;Throughout the legal battle and obstructions thrown on our way, we remained resilient and undeterred,&#8221; said Peters.&#8220;We were resolute in our commitment to leave no stone unturned in the fight off to reclaim the system, ever informed by our patriotism and unparalleled love to serve our country,&#8221; said the Minister.&#8220;The intervention is a demonstration of our commitment to fight and root out corruption as government ,a commitment we will always pursue without fear and hesitation,&#8221; said Peters.The handover is to be conducted in terms of the migration plan set out in schedule of the Turkey Agreement.Advocate Msibi, the CEO for road Traffic Management Cooperation, said &#8220;this is a very special day for us as we celebrate, we also send condolences to Teboho&#8217;s family who was part of the legal team who lost his life during this period.&#8221;&#8220;We thank the minister of transport we managed to win the driver&#8221;s license card case and now we have the software,&#8221; said Msibi.&#8220;This fervent occasion is characterised by mixed feelings for the Department of Transport and Government of South Africa in general , as we continue in our endeavours to provide leadership for a clean government,&#8221; concluded Minister Dipuo Peters.The Tasima staff will be absorbed by the road Traffic Management Cooperation.-TNA Repoorter
