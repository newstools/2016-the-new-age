President Michel Temer said on Thursday he has strong political backing for a federal spending ceiling and other measures to control Brazil&#8217;s budget deficit that will help the country soon overcome recession.&#8220;There is extraordinary support for the spending cap in Congress &#8230;I see widespread support for the measures we are taking,&#8221; Temer said in a speech. The 20-year spending cap has been passed by the lower house and is expected to clear the Senate by mid-December.-Reuters
