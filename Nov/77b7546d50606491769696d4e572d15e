Hong Kong&#8217;s leader said Monday that he would &#8220;fully implement&#8221; a ruling by Beijing which effectively bars two elected pro-independence lawmakers from the city&#8217;s legislature after they deliberately misread their oaths of office.An oath that did not conform to Hong Kong&#8217;s law &#8220;should be determined to be invalid, and cannot be retaken&#8221;, the Communist-controlled National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC) in Beijing said in a rare interpretation of the semi-autonomous city&#8217;s constitution.Hong Kong&#8217;s leader Leung Chun-ying told reporters he and the city government would &#8220;implement the interpretation fully&#8221;.-AFP
