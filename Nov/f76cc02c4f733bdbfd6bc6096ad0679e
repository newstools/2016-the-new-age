The Constitutional Court has ruled that a child born through surrogacy has the right to know his or her genetic origin, leaving a woman who has gone through 18 unsuccessful in vitro fertilisation procedures with no choice but to find a man or give up.Felicia (not her real name), a divorced middle-aged woman from Gauteng, tried for 20 years of her marriage to have a child through all available avenues.In 2002, after her divorce, she continued trying but was eventually told that she was unable to contribute her own gametes for conception and she was unable to carry a pregnancy to term. The only available option was surrogacy.However, Section 294 of the Children s Act requires that there be a genetic connection between her and the baby.The section requires the use of the gametes of neither commissioning parents or the gamete of one of the two parents if both parent can donate gametes due to either biological, medical or other reasons. Where there is one commissioning parent, as is the case with Felicia, the section requires the use of the gamete of that parent.Faced with the problem of not being able to contribute the gametes, Felicia challenged the constitutional validity of the section in court.The Minister of Social Development opposed the application, saying if the requirement for a genetic link between the child and the mother is removed, it will infringe the child s right to know his or her origin and could lead to the commercialising of surrogacy.The minister raised concern at the possible creation of designer children, of shopping around for gametes with the intention of creating children with particular characteristics and attempts to circumvent the adoption law.Yesterday, justice Bess Nkabinde ruled in favour of the minister. The requirement of donor gamete(s) within the context of surrogacy indeed serves a rational purpose, the public good chosen by the lawgiver, of creating a bond between the child and the commissioning parents or parent. The creation of a bond is designed to protect the best interests of the child to be born so that the child has a genetic link with its parent(s), Nkabinde said.The judges refused to accept Felicia s argument that the section was denying her the right to be a parent, saying there was still an option available to her, which is finding a fertile partner.Nkabinde said the impugned provision does not disqualify commissioning parents because they are infertile. If that parent cannot contribute a gamete, the parent still has available options afforded by the law. A single parent has the choice to enter into a permanent relationship with a fertile parent, thereby qualifying the parent for surrogacy. If the infertile commissioning parents, or parent, decide not to use the available legal options, they have to live with the choices they make, the judgment reads.Dudu Dubedudud@thenewage.co.za
