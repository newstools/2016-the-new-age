South Africa s Chanel Simmonds and Lloyd Harris will look to complete a hat-trick and clean sweep in the Digicall Futures Series tennis tournament in Stellenbosch. Simmonds and Harris have already won the Futures 1 and 2 titles in the women s and men s singles respectively.The Futures 3, which is in the third and final of the international series, hit off yesterday. The final will be played on Sunday. In the Futures 2, the country s top-ranked Simmonds registered her second title when she defeated Russia s Margarita Lazareva 6-1, 6-3. Though the score suggests an easy victory for Simmonds, the 27 year old said the fact that they are both left handed players made it hard to play against Lazareva. I am left-handed, but like any other player I don t like to play against left-handed players, Simmonds said. Everything is just different, I was prepared for a fierce battle after our semifinal last week when we played three sets. But I won the important points today and that was the difference. It was not easy, but I m playing good tennis at the moment and I really enjoy playing in Stellenbosch. When Harris powered to a 6-0, 6-1 victory over top-seed Jordi Samper-Montana of Spain on Sunday, he registered his fifth title in a row.Harris completed a hat-trick in the Future series edition which was held in Egypt last month, which saw him moving 33 spots up in the world rankings. It took Harris just 52 minutes to claim his fifth title in the tournament. I really did not think it would go that fast. Jordi is a good player. He has a good world ranking position and regularly plays in the Challenger Series, Harris said.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
