&nbsp;Johannesburg motorists who use the M1 freeway should brace themselves for a continuation of traffic jams and congestion as the Johannesburg Road Agency (JRA) has extended the completion date of the R210m rehabilitation project.JRA managing director Dr Sean Phillips said the Oxford and Federation bridges project, initially anticipated to be completed in February 2017 will in fact only be finished by September.Improvements to the double decker section were originally envisaged to be completed by May next year but it is now anticipated that these will only be done by the end of next year. The causes of the delays on the Oxford and Federation bridges project have been sporadic labour unrest and unforeseen geotechnical complications. The labour unrest occurred from April to August and resulted in a loss of about six weeks. The geotechnical complications have resulted in an extension of the scope of the works, which accounts for the remainder of the extended construction period, Phillips said.He said the delays in the double decker project have been caused by financial difficulties experienced by the contractor which resulted in the work stopping for a period of about four months. This has now been resolved and the contractor is back on site and work is again progressing well. The extension of the Oxford and Federation bridges project means that the M1 between Killarney bend and St Andrews will remain with a limited number of lanes open for a longer period. On the double decker most of the work is being done at night to avoid disruption of traffic, he said.On the double decker section of the M1, between Carr and Anderson streets in the city centre, the work includes rehabilitation and structural repairs, asphalt surfacing, expansion joints, drainage systems and new road signs.The Federation and Oxford bridges are also undergoing major facelifts. A 2km section of the M1 between Rockridge and Federation Roads is being rehabilitated and the existing stormwater drainage system in the area replaced.MMC for Transport Nonhlanhla Makhuba said Johannesburg road users had adapted exceptionally well to the traffic restrictions.The city s Rea Vaya Bus, Metrobus, Metrorail, Gautrain as well as taxis offer public transport options for commuters and traffic applications that can be downloaded from Google Maps and media will provide alerts on possible traffic jams and delays.nondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
