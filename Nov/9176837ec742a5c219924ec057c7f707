After a long dry spell, the much-needed rains this week were welcome, but left a trail of damage in parts of Gauteng.Cars and office blocks in Silver Lakes Road in Tshwane East were particularly hard hit.Tshwane Emergency spokesperson Johan Pieterse said that about 25 cars were trapped on Monday when the city was hit by a massive thunderstorm.In Johannesburg, motorists were left stuck in traffic, especially on the N3 Gillooly s Interchange in Bedfordview, following heavy rains.Houses in Maokeng Extension on Pilanesburg Street in Tembisa were also flooded.The rain resulted in several yard walls collapsing and household furniture being smashed.One of the flood victims, Annah Lehong, spent Wednesday night clearing the rain water from her house. It was horrible how the water kept coming into the house. I thought it was the end of us, she said. My yard wall has fallen over and some of the household items are damaged. It was disappointing and sad. Her municipal water meter was also uprooted by the floods. Beneath my house there is a stormwater drain that carries sewage from all over Maokeng and it sometimes leaks into the yard, she said.Meanwhile, other victims complained about the lack of stormwater drains in the area and even those that are there were allegedly blocked. It is why the water flooded our houses. If there were enough functional drains, we would not experience this disaster, one resident said. Some neighbours who built yard walls do not want to open holes for the water to pass through their yards. They say it is not their water, another resident said.Kutullo Madishakutullom@thenewage.co.za
