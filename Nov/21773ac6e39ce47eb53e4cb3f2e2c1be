FREE State lost out on yet another opportunity to have a club representing it in a football cup final.Free State Stars were hammered 4-1 by Cape Town City in the semifinal of the Telkom Cup on Saturday.Stars, who last appeared in the final of a major cup competition almost two decades ago, were hoping to emulate the class of 1994 who won the Coca-Cola Cup.The last time a Free State club won a major cup competition was when Bloemfontein Celtic defeated Mamelodi Sundowns in the same tournament in 2012.Before that, Celtic won the SAA Super 8 after defeating SuperSport United in 2005.Stars will now turn their attention to the Absa Premiership where they are struggling, lying at the foot of the table with five points from 10 matches. We are not in a good position in the league and we will now shift our focus there. I am disappointed that we have failed to reach the final but it was a good experience for the players, Stars coach Giovanni Solinas said.-MICHAEL TLHAKUDI
