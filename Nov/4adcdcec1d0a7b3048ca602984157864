Italian master-coach Marcello Lippi is facing one of his toughest assignments as he attempts what some fans think is impossible: putting under-achievers China on the path to greatness.Starting with Tuesday&#8217;s World Cup qualifier against Qatar, the silver-haired Lippi will set out to justify his hefty salary as China&#8217;s new boss and win over a sceptical public.Lippi, 68, won the World Cup with Italy and he is the only coach to lift both the European and Asian Champions League trophies, with Juventus and China&#8217;s Guangzhou Evergrande.But he faces an entirely different challenge as coach of China, whose dismal performances have seen them lambasted by their own long-suffering fans.While China&#8217;s well-heeled clubs, notably Evergrande, have spent their way to success, &#8216;Team Dragon&#8217; remain mired at 84th in the FIFA rankings, below Israel, Curacao and Libya.Such is fans&#8217; disillusionment that one widely circulated comment on social media compared Lippi&#8217;s arrival to a tycoon hiring &#8220;a Harvard graduate to tutor his retarded son&#8221;.Lippi&#8217;s appointment &#8212; at a reported $20 million a year &#8212; is the latest gambit by the Chinese FA, under pressure from President Ji Xinping to craft an era of success.The cigar-loving, medallion-sporting Lippi led Italy to the 2006 World Cup title, four years after China made their sole appearance at the tournament in 2002, when they failed to win a point or even score a goal.But while Lippi had undoubted talent at his disposal at Italy, Juventus and even deep-pocketed Evergrande, he cannot buy in fresh players to revitalise China&#8217;s squad.&#8211;AFP
