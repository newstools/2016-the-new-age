On the back of the recent heavy rains, Africa s largest estuarine lake and the world s oldest proclaimed estuary, Lake St Lucia, tells a far more positive story than images taken in February this year.Water levels in the Lake St Lucia system have increased dramatically, as a result of strong flows from the Umfolozi River into the lake. With 90% of the lake s surface area now covered, the lake is once again a single body of water and no longer compartmentalised.In February, only 10% of the surface of the lake was covered with water. The water now flowing into the system from the Umfolozi River has resulted in the water levels to rise to its present height of 1.2m above sea level.The direct rainfall and flow from other rivers such as the Umkhuze, Umzinene, Hluhluwe and Nyalazi is also providing much needed relief to the northern sections of the lake. While this is excellent news for the system, it is still not out of the woods and more rain is needed, especially in the catchment areas, Andrew Zaloumis, chief executive of iSimangaliso Wetland Park, said.He said the increase was partly due to the heavy rains and partly due to the ongoing restoration project.In January 2016, the iSimangaliso Wetland Park authority signed a R10m contract to remove some 100000m of silt obstructing the natural course of the Umfolozi River. The work has progressed slower than anticipated due to technical problems associated with the drought.The original method of silt removal using slurry pumps has now been augmented by a conveyor belt and truck system to accelerate the rate of production.iSimangaliso has also raised additional funding for the hydrological restoration of the Lake St Lucia system.A tender has been advertised for a second service provider in order to expedite the removal of the silt. With work continuing through December and January, it is anticipated that the first phase of rehabilitation will be completed in January. Our estuaries, with their surrounding wetlands, comprise some of the most productive yet threatened ecosystems in the world and the health of the Lake St Lucia ecosystem is directly linked to the livelihoods of people in the area in terms of tourism as well as harvesting of raw materials.
