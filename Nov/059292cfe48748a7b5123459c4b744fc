South Africa dodged a downgrade for the third time this year from credit rating firms Fitch and Moody s last week, but there is one more hurdle before we can go on holiday and stop worrying until the next time the agencies come to town Standard &amp; Poor s pronouncement on Friday.Last Friday, Moody s kept our sovereign credit rating at Baa2, which is two notches above noninvestment grade (junk).In March and June the agency made similar reviews. The rating still reflects risk related to implementation of structural reforms. Both political uncertainties and low business confidence were some of the key factors that put South Africa on a negative watch. The negative outlook recognises the downside risks associated with political uncertainty and low business confidence as well as the challenging external environment characterised by low growth, investment and trade, the agency said.In rather a strange move, Fitch, which was expected to make its move alongside S&amp;P s, instead chose the early hours of Friday morning to announce its revision from stable to negative .South Africa s rand weakened after Fitch cut its rating outlook to negative as it affirmed the country s investment grade rating at one-notch above junk. The unit dipped by as much as 0.4% shortly after the news from Fitch, before paring losses to 0.1% at R14.15/$.Fitch said in a statement that the South African economy may have started to recover but that the political risks remained.Responding to the announcement, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said political noise will have to be reduced to avoid downgrades. We must focus on growing the economy in order to avoid ratings downgrades to junk, he said.The ANC did not take kindly to the ratings firms comments on political uncertainty, saying political disagreements were a regular feature of democracy. What the impact of what happens at ANC conferences has on governance and macroeconomic performance is an untested and unscientific observation, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said.Stanlib chief economist Kevin Lings said the risk of a downgrade had clearly risen. Irrespective of Moody s upcoming ratings announcement, without structural reforms to lift growth and ensure more political stability, Moody s will be forced to downgrade SA to Baa3 either now or in six months time, Lings said.Now all eyes are on S&amp;P s, which rates South African debt on the lowest investment level with a negative outlook. The agency last Friday downgraded Eskom further into junk territory. S&amp;P cut Eskom s long-term corporate credit rating to BB from BB+, two steps below the investment threshold.However, South Africa is still better off than the other two African giants, Nigeria and Egypt, which were downgraded in June, making it all the more difficult to fund their 2016 budgets.Bernard Sathekge with Reuters | bernards@thenewage.co.za
