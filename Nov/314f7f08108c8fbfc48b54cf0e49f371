Small businesses operating in the province will benefit from a new development programme, which is a joint initiative between the Small Business Academy (SBA) of the University of Stellenbosch Business School (USB) and the Joe Gqabi Economic Development Agency (JoGEDA).The aim of the programme at the weekend was to assist small businesses in the Joe Gqabi district municipality to grow, create employment and contribute to the economy.The development programme offered in financially disadvantaged areas will see 26 small businesses from Aliwal North, Sterkspruit, Lady Grey, Ugie and Maclear receive sponsored business tuition and mentorship support from USB academic staff and alumni over a nine month period.The course covers training in general management, finances, marketing, computer skills, business plan development, personal development, mentoring, and practical workshops.With more than 35% of the region unemployed, chief executive of JoGEDA Ayanda Gqoboka said the partnership would bring a wave of change to the area. The biggest challenge we face in the SMME sector within the Joe Gqabi district is primarily a lack of information and formal business training. Almost all historically disadvantaged entrepreneurs in the region are survivalist businesses with little knowledge as to how to grow their businesses or how to leverage resources to move up a level. This platform will be the first of its kind in the region and will greatly support and encourage entrepreneurs to strengthen their businesses, he said.SBA head Dr Marietjie Theron-Wepener said supporting less privileged communities with business skills development was key. We launched the Small Business Academy in 2012 with the aim to meaningfully engage with society by empowering small business owners in low-income communities with business education and mentorship. The successes that small business owners achieved who participated in the SBA Development Programme in the Western Cape over the past four years have been astounding. This encouraged us to venture into the Eastern Cape where such support could make a difference, not only to the lives and businesses of the programme participants, but also to the overall economy of the area. The first group of participants in the SBA development programme were admitted after a strict selection process.The participants small businesses range from media, fashion design, agriculture and catering to construction.TNA Reporterprovinces@thenewage.co.za
