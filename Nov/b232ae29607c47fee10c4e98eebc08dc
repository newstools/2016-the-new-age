Education is a constitutional right that every child in the world should be afforded irrespective of class, creed or economic status. According to the Bill of Rights of South Africa s Constitution, all South Africans have the right to a basic education, including adult basic education and access to further education.The state has an obligation, through reasonable measures, to progressively make this education available and accessible. However when we speak of quality education, one cannot be so sure because in South Africa it seems to be something that is only reserved for the privileged.A number of former Model C schools that are attended by kids from lower to middle income households are going to be facing a significant fee increase 2017, the #FeesMustFall movement clearly has not taught these respective schools anything. One of the schools for example is Maritzburg Boys College that will increase by R3000 to R40000. Since when do state schools start charging high fees like that of a private school fee?One has mentioned before that Zimbabwe is a nation with its own flaws but its basic education is one of the best in Africa, the children are all afforded the same system as well as level of quality education whether they are poor or rich.In South Africa the quality of education you receive is dependent on your income status and it is always interesting to see our public servants who set some of these standards sending their children to private schools while some have to bear with inadequate public basic education.The Gauteng department of education spokesperson Oupa Bodibe has stated that the department will compensate schools for the poor kids who are granted fee exemption but obviously with the government funding terms and conditions apply.The terms are that the poor kid must provide proof that he or she is poor, one has really struggled with the idea that poor kids are humiliated and stripped of their dignity by having to authenticate their suffering and poverty in a bid for quality education is truly disheartening. It is not enough that you are poor; you actually have to prove it too.The fee increase in public schools can also be attributed to the lack of voices in the annual general meetings that parents have with the respective school governing bodies. Let us get into parents and their lack of investment in their children s education, some parents do not show up for a parent teacher conference let alone a crucial annual general meeting that decides what they will be paying for their child s education therefore a majority consensus can be reached without even hearing all the voices of the parents in the school due to a lack of interest.A fee increase is in the hands of the parent who reach majority consensus, the South African Schools Act allows them to do so, but in these Model C schools are the poor kid s parent who are in smaller numbers truly represented?Public schools all have the same curriculum, this is true but do they all have the same resources? This is where former Model C schools are different hence why kids from the township will travel 30 minutes to an hour just to attend one of these schools.Former Model C schools are attractive to all students from different backgrounds because they have the promise of a securing a better future for your child. Former Model C schools have access to the greatest advanced resources from their top shelf teachers to sports field to their multi-purpose centres,who wouldn t break their back to send their child to a first class education but as one has mentioned before in South Africa, a first class education comes at a very high cost.Basic education is supposed to prepare as well as give pupils a chance at higher education, in a dream fantasy world based on this alone it should be free or at the very least affordable, hiking public school fees to the extent to where some of these former Model C schools appear to be private schools will not empower the poor in fact it will further exclude the poor from a quality education.Canny MaphangaCanny Maphanga is a writer and commentator
