Samsung is recalling 2.8 million washing machines with a potential for a dangerous detachment of its top lid, the South Korean company and US safety officials announced Friday.The recall delivers a new blow to the electronics giant, which has scrapped production of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to risks of overheating batteries that can catch fire.The US Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a statement the Samsung washing machine top &#8220;can unexpectedly detach from the washing machine chassis during use, posing a risk of injury from impact.&#8221; Samsung received 733 reports of problems with the machines. Nine of those incidents involved injury, including a broken jaw and injured shoulder.Samsung said in a statement the recall affects models manufactured since 2011 due to &#8220;reports highlighting the risk that the drums in these washers may lose balance, triggering excessive vibrations, resulting in the top separating from the washer.&#8221;John Herrington, senior vice president of Samsung Electronics America, said, &#8220;We are moving quickly and in partnership with the CPSC to ensure consumers know the options available to them and that any disruption in the home is minimized.&#8221;Consumers with a recalled washer will be offered a free in-home repair or a rebate that can be applied towards the purchase of a new washer from Samsung or another brand.Samsung faced a class-action lawsuit that claimed some of the washers were &#8220;exploding,&#8221; leading to potential injury or property damage.The company, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of smartphones, recalled some 2.5 million Note 7s in 10 markets following complaints that its lithium-ion battery exploded while charging, and then had to expand that as reports emerged of replacement phones also catching fire. -AFP
