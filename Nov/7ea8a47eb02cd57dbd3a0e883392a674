THE parents of Everite Chauke, three, are living in limbo after they were unable to identify the decomposed body of a child who was washed down the Juskskei river in Beccleuch, Johannesburg.Everite disappeared during the recent floods in the area and the family were called in last Wednesday to identify a body at the Johannesburg mortuary.Due to the state of decomposition it was not possible for them to verify that it was Everite s body. Now they are waiting in agony for the results of DNA tests to ascertain whether the body is indeed that of little Everite. The situation is not easy for the couple as they still trying to get closure to the situation. Much will be said after the results have been released.They did however find it difficulty to identify the child as the body was beyond recognition, family spokesperson Kgabo Rapala said.Shadrak and Cinthia, the parents of the missing girl had earlier said they would only have closure once they see the body of their child who was swept away on November 15 after she slipped out of her father s arms when the branch of the tree they had climbed to escape the torrential water broke. kutullom@thenewage.co.zaKUTULLO MADISHA
