Matthew Fitzpatrick birdied the last hole to beat compatriot Tyrrell Hatton by one shot to win the $8 million DP World Tour Championship on Sunday.The 22-year-old Englishman completed a remarkable year in which he represented Europe in the Ryder Cup within two years of turning professional, and backed it up by winning the season-ending championship.Fitzpatrick closed with a 67 for a 17-under par total, one better than Hatton who made a bogey on the last hole after hitting his tee shot into the water.Henrik Stenson won the Race to Dubai for the second time in his career as the Swede shot a seven-under par 65 on the final day to finish on a 12-under par total, with none of his rivals doing any better than that.-AFP
