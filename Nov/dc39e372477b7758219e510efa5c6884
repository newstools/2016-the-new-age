South Africa coach Russell Domingo has all but ruled out Proteas batting superstar AB de Villiers for the third and final day/night Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval on November 24.Domingo said he can t see De Villiers featuring down under in this series. I doubt it, he has been caddying for a mate at a golf tournament, so I don t think he s going to be fit for Adelaide. I can t see AB playing in Adelaide, he told the media.De Villiers underwent an elbow operation last month which ruled him out of the once-off ODI against Ireland and the subsequent series against Australia where the Proteas whitewashed the visitors 5-0 at home.The Proteas did not miss De Villiers, who hinted recently that he may be fit for Adelaide, during the first Test in Perth and they will have to do it again without him in the second instalment which starts on Saturday in Hobart.The other key player who will not be part of the action at the Bellerive Oval is fast bowler Dale Steyn whose injured shoulder is set to sideline him for at least six months.He has since been replaced by Highveld Lions allrounder Dwayne Pretorius.Domingo, who has been under pressure for some time, described the 177- run victory over the Aussies in the first Test in Perth this week as the best four Test days of cricket he has seen. In terms of my three years in the side, we have won in Sri Lanka under tough conditions, we won in Dubai but this is the four best Test days of cricket that I have ever been part of, he said. To have only two bowlers, a debutant spinner and a middle order with a lot of questions asked of JP Duminy by the media and the public although we never doubted his form. As far as I am concerned, this is the best four days of Test cricket I have seen as a coach of this side. I can t comment on the previous Test wins I have probably watched as a spectator but in my tenure the best Test performance I have seen, he said. Mahlatse Mphahlelemahlatsem@thenewage.co.
