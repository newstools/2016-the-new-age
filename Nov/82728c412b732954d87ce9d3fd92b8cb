A total of 14 people from Etwatwa on the East Rand, including three juveniles, are due to appear in the Benoni Magistrate s Court on charges of kidnapping and attempted murder after allegedly kidnapping a teenager and attempting to set him alight because he was believed to be part of the notorious Overloaded gang popularly known as the OVL.The 16 year old is recovering in hospital after he escaped the mob justice attack on Thursday.Etwatwa police spokesperson Capt Pheello Mothapo said the suspects took the boy to a railway line where they tied tyres to him and set him alight. The police who were in the area saw smoke and went there only to find that the teenager was already on fire. They helped him and managed to arrest the 14, Mothapo said.He said the police were meeting with the community and the area was calm at the moment.Provincial police spokesperson Capt Mavela Masondo said that the 14 men accosted the teenager, assaulted him and attempted to set him alight. Police responded swiftly and managed to rescue the boy from the mob, Masondo said.This is the first time the community has taken the law into their own hands with regards to those they believed were responsible for being involved in the gang, which has been terrorising the community.Last week, the case of 63 community members who were arrested for setting alight two teenagers last month was struck off the court role due to lack of evidence.Police are still investigating whether the teenager is involved in criminal activities.Benoni Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Reza Patel said they had a meeting with the community members. There are people behind this who are using the youngsters to push their own agendas. The OVL was formed by the CPF working with the police a long time ago to sort out issues at ground level in the community but people have hijacked it and misused it for their own violent agendas, Patel said.He said the CPF discouraged the community from taking the law into its own hands. They (those with their own agenda) target young people because they want action and ask no questions so it s easy to be used for doing bad stuff but when we want them to do good, they don t want to be involved, Patel said.Nondumiso Zwanenondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
