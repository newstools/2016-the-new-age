Former British number one Anne Keothavong will succeed Andy Murray&#8217;s mother Judy as her country&#8217;s Fed Cup captain, the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) said on Tuesday.Her first assignment will be the Euro/Africa Zone Group 1 ties in Tallinn, Estonia following next year&#8217;s Australian Open.London-born Keothavong, whose brother James is a top-level umpire, retired, aged 29, in 2013 and has been working as a TV pundit for BT Sport since.She reached a career-high ranking of 48th in 2009 &#8211; the first British woman to crack the top 50 for 16 years.&#8220;I think Anne is a great choice as our next Fed Cup captain,&#8221; British number one Johanna Konta said.&#8220;She will lead from real life experience because she was a winner on court and she knew what it took to step up and play for her country.&#8221;-Reuters
