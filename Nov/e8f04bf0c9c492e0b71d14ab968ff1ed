Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina will officially receive the keys to the house of late struggle icon Chris Hani in Dawn Park, Boksburg, today. The house has been purchased by the city as part of its programme to preserve history and heritage. Among the proposals for the house which has been in private hands since Hani s death, is that it be turned into a museum where people can learn more about the life and times of Thembekile Chris Hani.Hani was untimely murdered on the property s driveway in 1993. Masina who announced plans to turn the house into a museum during a council meeting in September said the aim was to turn the area into a social cohesion hive. Chris Hani was free person of the city and each year in April we commemorate his life and legacy. It has always been our wish to purchase the property so that we can ensure that people are afforded a greater opportunity of getting to know him better, mayoral spokesperson Zweli Dlamini said. We have already built a monument and a liberation trail for Chris Hani at the Thomas Nkobi Cemetery, and now we are just adding another essential feature to the programme, Dlamini said. Meanwhile, member of the mayoral committee for human settlement, Lesiba Mpya, will on Saturday, hand over 160 title deeds to the residents of Esselen Park in Kempton Park and Vosloorus.The handover of tittle deeds is part of the mayoral 100-day programme, which seeks to distribute a total of 280 tittle deeds in 100 days. The recipients of the title deeds have been waiting for them as far back as 1996. The mayoral 100 days programme ends in November 30.ntombin@thenewage.co.za-Ntombi Nkosi
