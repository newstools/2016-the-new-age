Arsene Wenger is urging his Arsenal team to &#8220;finish the job&#8221; against French champions Paris St Germain on Wednesday by ensuring they top their Champions League group.Wenger said on Tuesday that it felt like a luxury to have qualification for the knockout stages in the bag but he is determined that his side, currently on an unbeaten 17-match streak, now cash in on home advantage by winning group A.Who will lead their assault on PSG&#8217;s defence, though, remains uncertain as Wenger has not decided whether to give his in-form &#8220;Super sub&#8221; Olivier Giroud a start at the Emirates Stadium.Arsenal and PSG have both qualified, amassing 10 points apiece, so the match feels like a straight shootout for the winner&#8217;s spot and a potentially easier round of 16 tie.&#8220;We have done the job in a convincing way. It is a luxury to be qualified after four games,&#8221; Wenger told a news conference.&#8220;We have done it away from home. Now, we have to finish the job at home. We played a draw there and now it is down to us to win the game.&#8221;Arsenal were lucky to scrape a 1-1 draw at Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday but Giroud&#8217;s late headed equaliser, his third league goal of the season, represented a bright spot.He has not started a league match this season, seeing only 109 minutes of action, as Wenger has utlilised him as a weapon to be brought off the bench.Yet his goals-per-minute strike rate is the best in the division with Wenger conceding on Saturday that while desperate for more playing time, Giroud was remaining angry in a positive way.&#8220;He is not forever on the bench. He will play games,&#8221; Wenger said. &#8220;I have not decided (if he will start against PSG).&#8221;The likelihood is the Frenchman will see more action in the near future with Wenger confirming he would try to give key striker Alexis Sanchez a winter break to help him avoid burn-out.Sanchez suffered an injury on international duty but Wenger reported he had &#8220;recovered completely&#8221; and refuted reports that the Chilean had been forced to play against Manchester United.&#8220;I never forced in my whole life a player to play. Suggestions we forced him to play are wrong,&#8221; Wenger said.&#8220;If I have the possibility I would like to give a winter break to everyone. I just had a chance to do it with (Mesut) Ozil.&#8221;-Reuters
