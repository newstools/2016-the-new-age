HOME Affairs has rejected any notion that it is not doing enough to fight corruption following a Corruption Watch report which found that immigrants were made to pay a price at each gatekeeping point, from security guards to officials to access services.Department spokesperson Thabo Mokgola was responding to the report, Project Lokisa: Asylum at a Price, which shows how government officials, including SAPS and the metro police, use their positions to cash in on desperate immigrants seeking services from Home Affairs, particularly at the Marabastad offices in Tshwane.Mokgola said the counter corruption project Operation Bvisa Masina, had apprehended over 110 including 54 officials since its inception last year. We therefore reject any insinuation that we are not fighting corruption. The majority of officials are honest and hard working people. The few found on the wrong side of the law are being dealt with accordingly he said.In the report, Corruption Watch said it received 314 reports about extortion, threats and solicitation from government officials since 2012.The city of Tshwane had the most complaints (185), followed by the city of Johannesburg with 75.The majority of reports (80%) related to refugee reception offices (RROs), while 17% implicated metro police and SAPS. These gatekeepers vary from the security guard who extracts R100 for allowing the refugee to literally enter the gate of the documentation centre, to the Department of Home Affairs official who is custodian of that vital final stamp and whose fee is often measured in thousands of rands, Corruption Watch executive director David Lewis said.A large 74% of complaints involved officials demanding bribes for asylum and refugee permits ranging from R1000 for a passport to R15 000 for asylum status and a work permit.The Marabastad RRO had the most complaints with regards to the solicitation of R100 to R200 bribes by security guards and, in some instances SAPS officials, for entry to the facility.Acknowledging the department s efforts to address corruption, Leanne Govindsamy of Corruption Watch said these efforts lacked vital components.
