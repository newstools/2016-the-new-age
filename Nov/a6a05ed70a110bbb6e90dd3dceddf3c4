Omphile Ramela will lead the South African Invitation XI in the three-day tour match against Sri Lanka to be played at Senwes Park from December 18 to 20 . It is important that these younger players have some experience to feed off and this will be provided by the likes of Ramela and Dane Piedt, Cricket South Africa (CSA) selection convener Linda Zondi said. We see this match as a wonderful opportunity to see what some of our younger players, who have shown good form in franchise cricket this season, can do against quality opposition, the selection convener said. This is a good chance for these players to show what they can do at the next level,&#8221; Zondi said.Zondi said the team is comprised of a number of provincial players who stood out in the Africa T20 Cup or for the SA Academy team.Meanwhile the South Africa A side has appointed Shukri Conrad as Head Coach for their upcoming tour of England in May and June next year as well as the annual tri-series against India A and Australia A which will be hosted in South Africa after the England tour.The team will play three, 50 overs matches against the England Lions as well as a four-day unofficial Test match.The team will in addition to the tri-series, play four-day unofficial Test matches against both their opponents.CSA Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat also said that as Conrad&#8217;s responsibilities with the A team will clash with the CSA Academy Winter Programme, an interim coach will be appointed in due course. We have reviewed the needs of our national coaching structures and decided to make a longer term Head Coach appointment for the South Africa A squad, Lorgat said. With greater emphasis on planning and developing our next best players, the appointment will be effective immediately,&#8221; he said.
