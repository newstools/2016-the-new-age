An elderly man who allegedly turned blesser , as older men who solicit sex from young girls for money or gifts are known, was arrested at GaRamochinyani village outside Tzaneen following a tip off.The 72-year-old pensioner allegedly started raping two girls aged 14 and 15 on a weekly basis since July. He was always calling them to the local sports ground to rape them one after the other before giving them R50 each and warning them not to tell anyone. But one of the girls told her mother on Monday and the mother alerted the Mokwakwaila police who subsequently arrested the old man, police spokesperson Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said.Provincial police commissioner LtGen Nneke Ledwaba expressed shock at the incident and warned that any crime, especially sexually related incidents, would not be tolerated. It is disappointing that a person of the suspect s calibre in terms of his age could become vicious to children instead of being a reliable grandfather, Ledwaba said.In another development, ANC regional secretary in Waterberg Nkolo Victor Tolly Mashamaite, 40, is expected to appear again in the Mokopane Regional Court next month on rape and bribery charges.Mashamaite appeared briefly in court on Monday and the case was postponed to December 5 for a plea to the charges. His R1000 bail was extended. He was arrested on October 12 following complaints by a 22-year-old woman that he raped her in a hotel room six months ago.She also alleged that he later offered her money to withdraw the accusations but she refused.However Mashamaite and notable ANC supporters had publicly said the charges appeared to be politically motivated. The accused said he was optimistic he would be able to clear his name in court.Montsho Matlalamontshom@thenewage.co.za
