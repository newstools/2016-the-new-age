South Africa captain Faf du Plessis insisted he wasn&#8217;t a cheat and warned cricket authorities had opened a &#8220;can of worms&#8221; on Wednesday after he was found guilty of ball-tampering in controversial circumstances.Du Plessis was fined his entire match fee on Tuesday after being caught on camera sucking a mint and rubbing saliva into the ball during last week&#8217;s second Test in Hobart.&#8220;I still completely disagree with that (decision),&#8221; du Plessis told reporters in Adelaide. &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve done nothing wrong&#8230; it&#8217;s not like I was trying to cheat or anything.&#8220;For me (ball-tampering) is picking the ball, scratching the ball. Shining the ball, I think all cricketers would say, is not in the same place,&#8221; du Plessis.Cricket South Africa chief executive Haroon Lorgat said he would raise the subject with the International Cricket Council after several leading figures questioned the case against du Plessis.&#8220;I just think it&#8217;s opened up a can of warms with what&#8217;s going to happen now going forward with the game,&#8221; du Plessis said. &#8220;Something like this needed to happen to create a bit more awareness around it.&#8221;However, Du Plessis escaped a ban and is free to lead the Proteas on Thursday in the third Test against Australia in Adelaide.Crisis-torn Australia have made six changes in a bid to stop an unprecedented series clean sweep by South Africa in the day-night Test.-AFP
