If it was up to Thulani Hlatswayo, Wits would have played their postponed games against Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns long ago. The Clever Boys are the only remaining team in the Absa Premiership not to taste defeat in the league this season and were leaders before last night s matches with two games in hand.Their match against Pirates, which was scheduled in September, was postponed due to the FeesMustFall campaign at Wits University, while their date against Sundowns was also moved as the Brazilians were taking part in the CAF Champions League competition.This means that Wits, currently sitting with 19 points after seven matches are two games behind in the title race. But seeing that both Pirates and Sundowns appear to be picking up momentum, Hlatswayo says he would have prepared to have met them on the dates originally on the fixture list. The Clever Boys will meet struggling Highlands Park tonight at Bidvest Stadium looking to continue with their unbeaten run.nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
