The hearings into the SABC board and its fitness to hold office are due to start in Parliament tomorrow and this is likely to be a discussion that will dominate the news.The investigation into the board s fitness to hold office would not have been necessary had it not been for the refusal of the board s member and chairperson Prof Mbulaheni Maghuve to joined others in resigning.Had the board chairperson quit, the board would have ceased to exist and so the ad hoc committee would have had to return to the National Assembly for another mandate. Now the SABC will be on the agenda and the media are likely to be focusing on the matter.In the Assembly, the first item on the agenda tomorrow will probably see unity, albeit a short-lived one, between political parties as they endorse Dr Setlhomamaru Isaac Dintwe as the new inspector-general of Intelligence.The unanimous choice of the ad hoc committee to appoint Dintwe out of 10 short-listed candidates once it has been approved by the House will be sent to President Jacob Zuma for approval.This will end a period of more than a year during which the position of inspector-general of Intelligence has remained vacant.Acrimony between political parties, particularly between the ANC and opposition parties, will likely ripple through the Assembly, which is due to sit until 7.30pm as Parliament rushes to its scheduled closure next week when it is time for a DA debate.Called a debate on an urgent matter of national public importance, the leader of the opposition will spearhead a discussion regarding the effect and the impact on the economy of the recent decisions by the National Prosecutions Authority to prosecute high profile leaders of the South African Revenue Service.Expected to be under fire from the opposition will be the Hawks and their attempts to drag Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan before the courts, the role of the commissioner of the South African Revenue Service, Tom Moyane, President Jacob Zuma, and allegations of proxies waging his battles.This argument has been heard before and tomorrow s debate will give DA leader Mmusi Maimane and others a chance to lather the debate with accusations.On Thursday, Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti is due to introduce a debate on fracking and other ways of gas exploration.Two parastatals, the South African National Roads Agency and South African Passenger Rail Commuters, will tomorrow and on Wednesday have a rough time answering charges of fruitless and wasteful expenditure to the standing committee on public accounts (Scopa).Transformation in rugby will come under the spotlight in the sports and recreation portfolio committee tomorrow when six provincial unions present their successes and challenges.Tomorrow Public Service and Administration Minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi, as chairperson of the governance and administration cluster, will give an update on achieving the goals of the National Development Plan. On the presidential front, Zuma will tomorrow officially open the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
