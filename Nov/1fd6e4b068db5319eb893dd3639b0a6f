THE provincial department of economic development and tourism in partnership with two local municipalities have embarked on a water management initiative to deal with shortages of water.The aim of the initiative is to involve communities in addressing water challenges, especially the young people, to come with innovative, sustainable and financially viable solutions.Local municipalities Sol Plaatje and Dawid Kruiper are partnering with the department, as well as a number of private companies, to ensure residents continue receiving clean water. We need to improve the management of water services including planning and maintenance of infrastructure and demand side interventions that can change behaviour, the department said.Stakeholders say challenges in Upington and Kimberley in terms of water management include access to appropriate water and sanitation services, and reducing per capita consumption of water through more effective demand site management, among other aspects.Recently, statistician-general Pali Lehohla said 99.1% of households in the province had access to water sources, which he said was an improved number compared to other provinces.The province came third in the report behind the Western Cape and the Free State. Lehohla said the data collected was based on the provision of water and sanitation in a general household survey from 2002-15.He said a lack of safe and sufficient drinking water had a severe impact on a number of areas especially among young children who are infested with intestinal worms transmitted through inadequate sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. The Northern Cape had access to improved drinking water sources and this is an achievement taking into account the population of the province. Lehohla said as much as there had been great strides made in providing access to clean water, more needed to be done to reach out to all South Africans, especially in rural provinces, where people are still fetching water from rivers. Unfair allocation of water resources and poor distribution networks hold back progress in extending access to all, he said.tiisetsom@thenewage.co.zaTIISETSO MANOKO
