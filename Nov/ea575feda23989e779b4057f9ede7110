When the new league season started, coach Cavin Johnson let go of experienced players at Platinum Stars totally convinced that his youngsters were ready for the rigours of PSL football.Nine games into the new season and the Dikwena coach is coming to the realisation that his young players are not ready to do as they please against even the likes of struggling Ajax Cape Town, who claimed a 3-2 victory over Johnson s team on Wednesday.The loss was Stars fourth of the season.Their five other matches ended in just two wins and three draws.That is a poor return for a side that finished third last year behind Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits.Johnson said he will have to bolster his side in January with more experienced players to help the team finish the season on a more respectable note. I don t think there is anything wrong going on here at the club. It is just a case of certain things not done correctly and mistakes at critical moments.That could be because we have young and inexperienced players.Maybe we made a mistake of thinking these youngsters were ready as now it does not look like they are, Johnson said. We will have to go into the market in January to get a few experienced players. I have spoken to the management and we are not pleased with how things have been going. There certainly are players that we are looking at and we believe if they can join us we will move up the log. The disastrous run has left Dikwena 11th on the league table with nine points from nine matches. At this point last season, Stars were top of the log. It is hard to compare, but we had done much better at this point last year. But that season is gone. We will have to help the players to be in the right frame of mind. We play well but we haven t been scoring and we concede too often at critical periods. MMASEKEPE MATSEBANEmmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
