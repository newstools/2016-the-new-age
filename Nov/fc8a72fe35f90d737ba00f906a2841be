After two years of roaming freely and prancing around in the sun, naturists in the province had a rude awakening when they found that they would no longer be allowed to bare it all in the breeze of the Mpenjati Beach in Trafalgar on the South Coast.The decision of whether to allow naturalists to continue bathing naked now rests on an investigation by the office of the public protector, which is adjudicating the matter and is expected to release its report early next year.Deputy public protector Kevin Malunga said they already had a sessionwith everyone concerned, where concerns such as insufficient consultation, contravention of by-laws and public indecency were raised. I went there for a site visit, just to see the actual beach itself and where the piece of land is situated. There is a moratorium over that area and no one can be nude there, Malunga said.He said there were concerns also raised by the local amakhosi who said there was a grave site next to the designated area and walking around nude would be disrespectful to the sacred land.He said the case had generated a lot of interest because of its peculiar nature. The nudist beach was officially given the go-ahead by the Hibiscus Coast Municipality (HCM) in October 2014, but a group called Concerned Citizens of Hibiscus Coast Municipality later objected to the decision. The group is made up of businesses, residents and faith-based organisations, who believeb that HCM s decision to approve use of the beach was flawed.One of the people at the forefront of the opposition is pastor Reggie John who said the correct due process in the matter had not been followed.Although he said the matter was more a moral issue than anything else, he said there were some legal matters that had not been followed. When this matter was taken to the public, the overwhelming majority indicated that this was not welcomed but the municipality still went ahead with it. The municipality also allowed people to get naked on the beach despite the fact that the by-laws have not been changed, John said.He said if the matter was taken through the legal processes and they lost, they would accept the results. The HCM said the correct processes had been followed and that whatever decision the public protector made, they would take it from there, spokesperson Simon April said.Just before the start of the festive season last year, the municipality received a letter from Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube saying no nudity would be allowed as the by-law to legalise the beach as a nudist venue had not been formalised.Signs warnings beachgoers that they might encounter nudists, which were placed after the approval, had to be removed. The by-law says no person may remain, bathe or sunbathe in any part of the beach if in the nude or while clad indecently or improperly, provided that this provision did not apply to the act of breastfeeding a child.Any person convicted of an offence under this by-law is liable to a fine of an amount of no more than R40000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years, or both.This, however, has not deterred naturists from taking to the beach in their birthday suits.April said while this was illegal and people could be punished, it was hard to stop people from doing it. People were already using that piece of land to be nude before they even applied for it to go legalised. It cannot be stopped now because the legality issue was not sorted out, he said.The South African Naturist Association (Sanna) said they would allow the process to unfold with the public protector and could not comment further until then.In a message written on their website the chairperson of Sanna Athol Lutge warned naturists to stay away from the beach until the by-laws had been relaxed or face arrest.LILLIAN SELAPISA
