We kiss the ones we love, and love the ones we kiss! That&#8217;s why kissing is the easiest way to tell your partner how you feel about them. The sweet old, unhurried peck not only makes you feel good, but it has a surprising number of health benefits too. How&#8217;s that for an incentive to lock lips? So, go ahead and express yourself in the easiest language of love ever invented.Helps you bond betterIt goes without saying that kissing someone you love encourages better bonding. It takes intimacy a notch higher and there are scientific reasons for its good effects. Oxytocin, or the &#8216;love&#8217; hormone, gets released in both men and women, which helps strengthen the bond resulting in a lasting relationship. In fact, the more you kiss and the longer you kiss ensures commitment. Just the fact that you can kiss passionately says your bond is still strong, because faking passion is tough. Think of it as a sign of how healthy your relationship is.Improves sexual compatibilityKissing is a part of foreplay and a very powerful one at that. Think about the most erotic experience you had and how it began. Nine times out of ten, it&#8217;s the kiss that starts it all. Being kissed by someone you love, boosts self-esteem and makes you feel confident in taking the next step, either in life or just between the sheets. For those who just started dating, the first kiss can be a measure to determine how attracted you are to that person. So better get it right, because kissing can actually be a compass to avoid bad dates and heart aches.Boosts happiness quotientEver notice why a good kiss leaves you all dreamy-eyed and smiling? That is because it releases endorphins which are the feel good, calming chemicals that make you happy and boost your immunity. Not just that, there have been studies which say that kissing helps to curb depression better than any psychologist&#8217;s treatment or anti-depressants. You will not find any free happiness boost like this. This means smooching literally is a win-win situation.Tones Your Facial MusclesExperts say that a passionate, long lasting kiss involves 34 facial muscles and up to 112 postural muscles in the rest of the body. This pleasurable exercise keeps the muscles tight and toned and increases blood circulation. Putting all that energy in kissing also leads to exercising your neck and jawline which helps you look younger by preventing early wrinkles and thereby delaying ageing.Good for the heartKissing releases adrenaline which, according to experts, promotes heart health. The heart pumps more blood leading to lower levels of blood pressure. The improved blood circulation maintains the condition of your heart. Pumping up adrenaline boosts cardiovascular health according to health care professionals.Burns caloriesThere&#8217;s good news for those wanting to burn calories&#8230; you can enjoy an intense kiss and burn around 10-15 calories. Regular kissing is also known to boost your metabolism which in turn helps you burn more calories in the long run. So, even if it is not going to replace your workout session, a smooch may burn up to six calories a minute.Helps with dental hygieneWant to maintain your pearly whites? Remember, kissing is one of the most natural ways of cleaning your teeth since a wet kiss helps to break down the oral plaque and prevents cavities by the creation of saliva and keeps bacteria away. So, go ahead and sparkle your teeth with some intense and passionate kisses.Keeps stress at bayWhen you have had a tiring day, go home and kiss your partner. It will make you feel good because kissing is a stress reliever which helps lower cortisol (stress hormone) levels. Cortisol has a negative effect on the immune system, endocrine system and brain health. So if you can lower stress and reduce those negative effects by simply stealing a kiss, do it as often as you can! And it need not be a passionate lip lock every time. Even a peck on the cheek or a kiss on the forehead is enough to help you relax and hopefully make that headache disappear.What does your kiss mean?&nbsp;Bollywood and KissingHindi films have always have had kissing scenes, right from the black and white ones to the latest releases.
