Eskom&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Molefe has announced his resignation as CEO of the power utility.In a statement released on Friday afternoon, Molefe attacked former public protector Thuli Madonsela&#8217;s State of Capture, which had labelled him as being corrupt, because of his close ties with the Gupta family.Molefe cited that his decision to resign is based on the interests of the utility and the public as a whole.&#8220;I have, in the interests of good corporate governance, decided to leave my employ at Eskom from 1 January 2017. I do so voluntarily: indeed I wish to pay tribute to the unfailing support I have had since I took up office form the chairman, the Board and with those with whom it has been my privilege to work. Together we brought Eskom back from the brink,&#8221; Molefe said in a statement.Molefe added that his decision to resign is not a sign nor an admission of wrongdoing on his part, but rather what he felt is right in the interests of the company and corporate governance.Eskom&#8217;s spokesperson Khulu phasiwe told ANN7 that Molefe and his family were affected by the State of Capture report, that is why he decided to resign. We will hear in due cause who will step in as the replacement, but Mr. Molefe will be with us up until the 31 of December, Phasiwe said.Phasiwe said that Molefe was part of the team of management who made sure that they kept the lights on, so him leaving would not be a problem for the entity. Eskom is not dependent on individual, although we have individuals but collectively we have 47 thousand people within Eskom who are making sure we keep lights on. Right now as I speak to you we have stability at the board level, we also have stability at management level, Phasiwe said.Meanwhile portfolio Committee on Public Enterprise Dipuo Duma, said although the committee has not yet received a formal information officially,but she said they would invite the board as early as Monday to understand the exact reason for Molefe&#8217;s resignation. We are very saddened by the news, because as the committee we were very happy when he joined Eskom. We are disappointed by the resignation, Molefe was able to turn around Eskom in terms of load shedding and also stabilise leadership issues in the institution, Duma added.In addition the Committee member said her assessment showed that molefe was very reputable individual with a very strong ethics, and that the portfolio committee didn t believe he was guilty of the whole Gupta issue.Molefe thanked shareholders representative Minister Lynn Brown and all board executive and all Eskom&#8217;s employees for their hard work and support they showed for him.Molefe is expected to leave office on 01 January 2017.#BREAKINGNEWS: #ESKOM CEO Brian Molefe has resigned.&mdash; ANN7 (@ANN7tv) November 11, 2016#BREAKINGNEWS: #ESKOM CEO Brian Molefe has resigned.&mdash; ANN7 (@ANN7tv) November 11, 2016#BREAKING #Eskom Molefe: I wish to reiterate that this act is not an admission of wrong doing on my part. @ANN7tv&mdash; Kalden O Lachungpa (@KaldenOngmu) November 11, 2016#Eskom Molefe says this is a correct thing to do in the interests of the company and good corporate governance. @ANN7tv&mdash; Kalden O Lachungpa (@KaldenOngmu) November 11, 2016#Eskom Molefe: I go now, because it is in the interests of Eskom and the public it serves, that I do so. @ANN7tv&mdash; Kalden O Lachungpa (@KaldenOngmu) November 11, 2016-Sipho Jack
