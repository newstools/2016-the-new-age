The coffers of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) have dried up, forcing the police watchdog to slow down investigations.An Ipid source said some investigators have had to be called back to the Pretoria office because of the unavailability of funds. We re battling because of court cases and restructuring. A lot of money was wasted. As a result, investigations are suffering. One of the cases is the Marikana case in which investigators have had to come back to the head office and now have to drive to Marikana, which affects the whole process, the source said.Head of the police investigative unit Robert McBride only returned to work last month following a 17-month suspension.Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini yesterday requested more time to provide information, himself also making a return from a 14-month suspension.Ipid has however previously told Parliament it needed R5m for its Marikana investigation but had been unable to source the money from the Treasury.The Ipid briefed Parliament s police committee on the unit s budget.The Farlam Commission looked into the deaths of 44 miners at Marikana in 2012. It recommended that Ipid be part of a task team to investigate the police s role in the incident.Israel Kgamanyane, who acted as Ipid head during McBride s suspension, told Parliament that despite budget constraints, the Marikana investigation remained important. We are still going to utilise our current budget to make sure that we see to it that we attend to Marikana, in respect to investigations as per the Farlam recommendations with or without that declined budget from the Treasury. However, the Treasury s Thabisa Whittington denied Ipid had requested money, saying the unit had only spent 55.7% of its allocated budget of R242.1m as at the end of September, which translated to R134.8m. Only 55% of the budget for the programme had been spent as at the end of September. It should further be noted that in order to support the work of investigators, the national Treasury approved the shifting of R3.9m towards programme two during the adjustments budget to provide for travel and accommodation costs for investigators over the remaining months of the financial year, Whittington said.An Ipid report said the directorate had incurred, registered and disclosed irregular expenditure amounting to R2m due to the appointment of two legal firms for assistance with disciplinary hearings, legal advice on various legal matters and registration of the proposed Ipid logo.Police department spokesperson Sandile Ngidi was unavailable for comment.Mthokozisi Dubemtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
