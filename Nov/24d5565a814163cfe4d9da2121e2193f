BROKEN theatre equipment at Pietersburg Provincial Hospital in Polokwane has forced the provincial department of health to suspend medical operations.The department spokesperson, Derick Kganyago, said the decision was taken after chiller plants (which bring temperature to desired levels during operations) became dysfunctional. We have ordered two chiller plants overseas and one has already arrived. Service providers are on site and we have received an indication that they will complete the maintenance process by December 5.The department will communicate with the public should there be any delay on the completion date of this process, Kganyago said. The second machine may arrive in January next year.Maternity and emergency theatres would remain functional at Pietersburg Hospital, the department said. We have made arrangements that certain procedures (operations) be done at Mankweng, Seshego and Lebowakgomo hospitals in the interim. Our five regional hospitals are also capacitated to handle certain procedures and our surgeons will be utilising some of these facilities during this period, Kganyago said. The department said Dr Steve Matshidza and his team had operated on 30 patients at Tshilidzini Hospital near Thohoyandou at the weekend, illustrating that regional hospitals were able to carry out operations, the department said.Health authorities urged people to be patient and to contact hospital CEOs and clinical managers when they encountered problems. We must understand that our facilities are old and from time to time we will be forced to shut down certain divisions in order to perform the necessary maintenance.MONTSHO MATLALAMONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
