Struggling for food is nothing new for elderly Mookgo Oliphant from Thaba Nchu.Although food security is not her immediate concern, she is among the many people in the province who are said to be hardest hit by the drought that has affected farmers around the country resulting in food insecurity.When she was paid a visit this week by the agriculture department, the 91-year-old Oliphant said that she did not have food in her house and had no idea where her next plate would come from with the high cost of living.She is among those who have been encouraged to plant vegetables in their yards to reduce the amount of food that they have to buy.Oliphant, who lives with her granddaughters, said life had become very difficult because everything was expensive these days unlike when she was growing up. Oliphant s and her social grant is not enough to enable her to buy enough healthy food. We can no longer afford to feed ourselves properly and we live in poverty, she said on World Food Day this week. Things are really bad here but I am happy about this message and I hope that my two girls will also heed the call to start producing our own food, Oliphant said.Thaba Nchu has been mentioned as one of the hardest hit towns in the province along with QwaQwa, the Xhariep district and some parts of Fezile Dabi.Dr Takisi Masiteng, who is the general manager of district services in the provincial agriculture department, said food insecurity was a major concern.Masiteng also said that the scarcity of water exacerbated the food insecurity situation and called on communities to use water wisely and effectively because of its shortage.He said water levels were decreasing and even farmers who had boreholes were beginning to feel the pinch. Food security is presently a serious challenge and that is why we have intensified communities to plant vegetables. But we have seen that more people are heeding the call and we are now sitting at more than 170000 households that are planting their own vegetable and when we started we only had 12000 homes doing this, Masiteng said.Kamogelo Seekoeikamogelos@thenewage.co.za
