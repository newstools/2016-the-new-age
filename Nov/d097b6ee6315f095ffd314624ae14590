Plaudits after South Africa s crushing victory over Australia in the second Test have gone to the players who took the wickets and got the runs in Hobart. However, purists have lavished praise on Faf du Plessis for his excellent captaincy. Kagiso Rabada, Vernon Philander, Keshav Maharaj and Kyle Abbott shone with the ball while Quinton de Kock, Temba Bavuma, Dean Elgar and JP Duminy dominated with the bat during the two matches.Under Du Plessis s captaincy, the Proteas beat New Zealand 1-0 in a Test series at home before whitewashing Australia 5-0 in ODIs and have already beaten the Aussies twice away from home in the Test series. Du Ples sis is on the verge of leading the Proteas to a rare Test series whitewash over their bitter rivals if South Africa go on to win the third and final day-night match in Adelaide next Thursday.The Proteas recent success under the leadership of Du Plessis has prompted calls for the T20 skipper to be given the Test captaincy on a full-time basis to take over from childhood friend AB de Villiers, who has missed the clashes against Ireland, New Zealand and Australia due to injury.Former Proteas captain Graeme Smith, who has more wins as a Test captain than anyone else in the history of the game, said during a recent gala dinner that the leadership issue is up to the management. Asked after the Hobart Test if he wanted to take over the captaincy on a full time basis, Du Plessis hinted that he would like to give it a go. I have always said that I love captaining, he said. It s something I really enjoy doing. For me it s just really important to make sure that all the stuff that we talk about, the culture, if you live that and lead from the front, then that s the most important thing. I am enjoying it at the moment and however long it continues, I will always do it. mahlatsem@thenewage.co.za-Mahlatse Mphahlela
