Classes are expected to resume at the Mmabatho College of Nursing today after about three weeks since they were suspended.The North West Health department closed the college on October 14 following disruptions to the learning and teaching cycle due to student protests.Disgruntled students and some staff members embarked on a protest.They said the shortage of lecturers at the college was compromising their studies.Health MEC Dr Magome Masike said measures have been taken to deal with these challenges.He expects the academic programme to continue as normal, with students going back to class and attending to their clinical areas on Monday. I m appealing to all students to return to the college today so they continue with their studies, Masike said.He said a process of recruiting additional lecturers will start once there is approval from the provincial treasury. We remain committed to the culture of learning with a view to educate and produce future nurses for our province and the country, Masike said.At the time of the protests, Olesilwe Menoe, the disciplinary advisory desk officer in the student leadership structure at the college, said they wanted more lecturers. Our main issue is that instead of 75 lecturers, we have only 40 and two of these are set to resign soon. This puts a strain on the few lecturers and they suffer under an unbearable workload. We also feel that the quality of nurses produced at the end is compromised because we don t have quality time with the academic staff, he said.Menoe said students in their final year risk finishing the year without receiving their results. The lecturers cannot mark all the work and have the results available in time. We need the department to act fast because we don t want to wait for next year, he said.He said some of the lecturers who were overburdened with the responsibilities of teaching and marking also supported the protest.The health department is under co-management with the provincial finance department and they need to agree on any issues affecting its finances.Nursing lecturers have been hard to come by for the department as it appears that some of them resign to go back into practice.It was not immediately clear whether the issue of remuneration could be a factor behind this trend.Elfas Toreraielfast@thenewage.co.za
