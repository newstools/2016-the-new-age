An HIV-positive Malawian man who said he had sex with at least 100 girls and women in traditional cleansing rituals was sentenced Tuesday to two years in jail for &#8220;harmful practices&#8221;.Eric Aniva was prosecuted on the orders of President Peter Mutharika after publicly speaking about his role as a &#8220;hyena&#8221; in a BBC radio documentary earlier this year.&#8220;I convict you to serve 24 months&#8217; imprisonment,&#8221; judge Innocent Nebi told Aniva in a packed courtroom in the remote southern district of Nsanje.On Friday, in the first case of its kind, Aniva was found guilty on two charges after a one-day trial.Custom in some parts of southern Malawi demands that a man, known as a &#8220;hyena&#8221;, is paid to have sex with bereaved widows to exorcise evil spirits and to prevent other deaths occurring.At the request of a girl&#8217;s parents, the &#8220;hyena&#8221; is also paid to have sex with adolescent girls to mark their passage to womanhood after their first menstruation.Aniva, who pleaded not guilty, told AFP immediately after the sentence: &#8220;I am disappointed because I thought I would be given a suspended sentence.&#8221;The charges, under the gender equality act, involved the ritual of sex with widows as none of the younger girls would testify.&#8220;The convict had no regard to the feelings of widows, no regard to dignity of women and it is even doubtful that condoms were used,&#8221; the judge said. &#8220;Such a culture has no place in Malawi.&#8221;After an international outcry over the documentary, President Mutharika ordered Aniva&#8217;s arrest in July.-AFP
