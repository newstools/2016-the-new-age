African National Congress(ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe on Tuesday said the National Executive Committee (NEC) did not support the call for the President Jacob Zuma to resign.&#8220;Following robust, honest, candid and at times difficult discussions, the NEC did not support the call for the President to step down. The NEC resolved it was more urgent to direct the energies of the ANC in its entirety to working towards the unity of the movement, Mantashe said.Mantashe was speaking at the ANC&#8217;s headquarters in Johannesburg after the party&#8217;s NEC meeting which ended on Monday .The Secretary General dismissed rumours that the NEC voted on the matter of whether the President should be removed or not, as being baseless, adding that the organisation doesn t suppress debates on the matter but rather engages and persuades each other.&#8220;The essence of engagement and discussion is persuasion in order to arrive at consensus. As such, the NEC of the ANC always seeks to persuade one another through argument. It does not seek to conclude matters through voting, Secretary General emphasised.He said the organisation decided to dedicate two days of the party&#8217;s policy conference next year, to a consultative conference that will be aimed at assessing the state of the organisation.-TNA Reporter
