Willem de Kooning&#8217;s &#8220;Untitled XXV&#8221; was sold late Tuesday at Christie&#8217;s in New York for $66.3 million, a record for a work by the abstract artist and for post-war contemporary art.The imposing work, which measures 7 by 6.5 feet (2 x 2.2 meters), was painted by the Dutch-American artist in 1977 and is emblematic of the energetic, multicolor brush strokes he used in his work of the mid 1970s.Christie&#8217;s auction house initially valued &#8220;Untitled XXV&#8221; at $40 million (37 million euros). When the same painting was auctioned ten years ago it went for $27.1, a record at the time.The bid was placed in a phone call, and the buyer&#8217;s identity was not revealed.New York&#8217;s fall auction season kicked off this week with an array of masterpieces, drawing bidders from around the world at Christie&#8217;s and Sotheby&#8217;s auction houses.Late Monday Edvard Munch&#8217;s &#8220;Girls on the Bridge&#8221; sold for $54.5 million, the second-highest auction price paid for a work by the Norwegian painter, Sotheby&#8217;s said.The 1902 painting depicting women in colorful dresses fetched a price higher than the auction house&#8217;s estimate of above $50 million.There&#8217;s no shortage of bidders in the United States, Paris, London &#8212; and increasingly Asia, with growing Chinese fortunes spent on internationally recognized works at both major auction houses.The sales will serve as a barometer of the global art market, which did well during this year&#8217;s spring auctions despite a slow 2015.-AFP
