THE Department of Science and Technology (DST) has said that innovative technology introduced in Ndakana village in the Eastern Cape has improved access to quality sanitation while saving water for the people.DST launched an off-grid sanitation technology solution called the low pour flush toilet system and has said that it was already benefiting more than 120 households in the Amathole district municipality. The system is low maintenance and uses only 2 litres of water for one flush. The initiative is a partnership between the DST, the Water Research Commission (WRC) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and is aimed at demonstrating innovative sanitation technologies in rural areas. The initiative identifies appropriate sanitation solutions that have social acceptance, with low operating costs. The toilet system was designed to have a look and feel similar to a full flush toilet but enables greater flushing efficiencies and robustness, the DST said.The DST also launched another new system to help municipalities improve their turnaround times when attending to service delivery complaints. The Corrective Action Requests Report System (Carrs) is web-based technology to improve the efficient management of water leaks designed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.The Carrs project is being piloted in eight district municipalities, Amathole in the Eastern Cape, Capricorn and Vhembe in Limpopo, Ehlanzeni in Mpumalanga, iLembe in KwaZulu-Natal and Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati, Ngaka Modiri Molema and Bojanala Platinum in the North West, the department, said.Speaking at the launch, DST deputy director-general for socio-economic innovation partnerships Imraan Patel said the system represented a significant step up the sanitation ladder fromVIP latrines which were associated with poor user experiences. What started as a pilot study with 20 household toilets has now grown with more than 600 of these innovative sanitation systems implemented countrywide, he said.Patel said that while most South Africans aspired to have a flush toilet, it was technically challenging to deliver this sanitation technology to all unserved communities. The cost of constructing such infrastructure is high and there are limited resources, including valuable drinking water, to flush down the pan. Through innovative approaches, we are able to simultaneously achieve our national development targets by providing communities with a technology that matches their aspirations while being economically and resource efficient, Patel said.Commenting on the significance of the system, WRC executive manager Dr Jay Bhagwan said the low flush addressed the aspirations of many South Africans for flush toilets while overcoming the logistical challenges involved with standard sewerage and working within the limits of the country s water resources. The pilot testing indicated high user acceptance, significant water saving compared to full flush toilets and less trash disposal. This is part of the new wave of innovators investigating alternative sanitation methods, bringing renewed attention to an oft-neglected service, he said.Executive mayor of Amathole district councilor Nomfusi Winnie Nxawe also welcomed the initiative saying it would improve the lives of the people in the area. We are grateful that we get to put to the test technology and ways in which it can be used to make the lives of our people better. As a drought-stricken district,including Amahlathi, all the technology being provided by the national Department of Science and Technology will undoubtedly assist us in providing services for our people amid challenges we face in water provision. The launch of these two projects comes a few days before World Toilet Day which is coordinated by the United Nations in collaboration with governments and relevant stakeholders to raise awareness about thousands of people who still do not have access to proper sanitation around the world despite the human right to water and sanitation.The UN estimates that more than 200 million people in the developing world still do not have access to safe drinking water and 2.5 billion cannot access proper sanitation with a large percentage in Africa. indiphileb@thenewage.co.zaINDIE BOYCE
