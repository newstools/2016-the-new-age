Two days of the party&#8217;s policy conference will be set aside to look into the state of the party, African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said on Saturday.Mantashe was addressing media in Pretoria at the party&#8217;s National Executive Committee (NEC).He was giving feedback of the meeting to journalist on what the NEC and the Veterans had agreed on. There was an agreement reached with party veterans during yesterday&#8217;s meeting to go to an &#8220;all-inclusive&#8221; conference, Mantashe said.The Secretary General said the party will dedicate two days of next year&#8217;s policy conference to look at state of the ANC then proceed with policy issues.The veterans wrote a letter last month to ANC president Jacob Zuma and the NEC tabling their dissatisfaction about the manner in which the current leadership was stirring the ship.The veterans wanted to discuss a variety of issues with the president including President Zuma&#8217;s leadership.Anglo Gold Ashanti Chairman Sipho Pityana is one of the first veterans who went publicly calling for President Zuma to resign as head of State.Pityana was addressing mourners at the funeral of the late stalwarts Makhenkhesi Stofile at the time.However, following the successful meeting the Veterans had with the National Working Committee (NWC), the veterans spokesperson Wally Serote distance party stalwarts from Pityana&#8217;s utterances saying that the group never wanted President Zuma to resign. We never called for anyone to resign -a positive step- to things cannot be the same, Serote told ANN7.Mantashe also told journalist that they agreed that before the succession debate can begin, members needed to discuss the issues of principle before branches suggest names for leadership positions.&#8220;We have agreed let&#8217;s talk on principles first and not names, he added.When asked about whether the organisation was not scared to loose voters if they don t listen to its own veterans, Mantashe said if the party can put veterans in the periphery that can drive away voters.-Sipho Jack
