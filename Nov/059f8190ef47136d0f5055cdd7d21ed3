Since Free State Premier Ace Magashule urged municipalities in the province to implement water restrictions, the department of water and sanitation says there have been significant progress in the reserves.Departmental spokesperson Kido Thoabala said the department has worked closely with all the municipalities in the province since the declaration of drought to provide water to the communities. The meaning of water restriction is that water should be available and used but in a different manner. For an example, watering of lawns, gardens using a hosepipe and washing of cars using hosepipes is not allowed and unattended water leaks must be reported to authorities with immediate effect. She said the water and sanitation provincial office took a decision to establish a task team that comprises municipalities and water boards and the committee meets biweekly.In their meetings, they discuss the dam levels and the impact that is done by implementation of water restrictions and share other methods that can be used to save water in the process. The good news is that most municipalities have confirmed that since the implementation of water restrictions there has been a slight impact in terms of reserves. The idea is to make people aware that water is everyone s business not the municipalities alone as the water services authority, Thoabala said.She went on to say that there has been a positive response from most of the municipalities they have engaged. Most municipalities that were visited through awareness campaigns over the past few months have given us feedback that at least there is behavioural change and there is a slight improvement. Thoabala said working together with various stakeholders will move the country forward and make people aware that saving water is a good thing and not only during drought.She continued to urge people to use water sparingly. Even if there have been light showers in the province the dam levels remain low.provinces@thenewage.co.za
