Durban is back on track with all delivery partners working towards meeting the criteria necessary for South Africa to remain hosts of the 2022 Commonwealth Games.The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc), chaired by Gideon Sam, was given until the end of November by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) to have in place all financial guarantees and agreements or lose the right to host the games.Durban won the right to host the games after the only other bidder, Edmonton, Canada pulled out at the 11th hour last September. But early last month, the CGF warned that South Africa must meet a series of conditions or face being stripped of the games. The country had failed to pay a first tranche of about R25m to the CGF, which was due in April. Durban is yet to sign the host city contract while a mandatory local organising committee is yet to be set up.The national Treasury is still to sign financial underwriting arrangements that are meant to provide assurances that should anything go wrong the government will chip in financially and ensure the games go ahead.However, an inside source yesterday said concerted efforts were being made to ensure the deadline is met. The CGF is behind South Africa and in the next nine days a lot of progress will be made towards meeting the deadlines. The Treasury has come to the party and other key things like the host city contract and the setting up of an LOC should be in place come November 30, the source said.Treasury spokesperson Yolisa Tyantsi said intergovernmental discussions between the Treasury and the Department of Sport and Recreation had been concluded. Any enquiries on the matter should be referred to the sports department as the custodian of the games, she said.Department spokesperson Esethu Hasana said an announcement would be made once everything was concluded.CGF spokesperson Martin Reynolds said consultations with the Durban 2022 team indicated that all was on course.&#8211;Mthokozisi Dube
