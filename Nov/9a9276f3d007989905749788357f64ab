Two South African Broadcasting Corporation(SABC) Board members Nomvuyo Mhlakaza and Aaron Tshidzumba have resigned on Tuesday.Two more SABC board members resignThe duo&#8217;s resignation follows the dramatic resignation of their two former colleagues Krish Naidoo and Vusi Mavuso while attending the Parliament s communications committee in October.The resignation of the two members means that the board chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe is the only non-executive member currently seating in the board. For the current board to be able to form a quorum in a meeting it needs nine members.In October a unanimous resolution to launch a commission of inquiry into the board s fitness to hold office was taken by the committee.As it stands the committee currently has 26 people listed as witnesses who wish to take part in the inquiry.During the SABC&#8217;s press briefing last month the chairperson lashed out at the Parliamentary communications committee saying they were not given enough time to prepare, as the second letter inviting them had changed without regard for the board to engage on issues it raised.Maguvhe told journalists who attended the briefing at the corporation&#8217;s headquarters that he would not be bullied into resigning and he had a right to fight for his job through the courts if need be. I am not a coward and will not resign. I am still waiting for the letter through the so-called inquiry. Some of them have been intimidating us, saying obviously as individuals when they receive these letters they would resign, he said.Meanwhile, President Jacob Zuma has accepted the resignations of the two board members with immediate effect.&#8220;The President has thanked the two former board members for their contribution during their tenure at the SABC and wished them well in all their future endeavours,&#8221; presidential spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga said in a statement.&nbsp;-Sipho Jack
