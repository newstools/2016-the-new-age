The MEC for education in the province Tate Makgoe has urged pupils in and around Botshabelo to forget about their past experiences and focus on building a better future for themselves by concentrating on their studies.He said he was happy with the progress the schools in Botshabelo have made over the past few years and he expects them to continue improving. We are glad that schools in Botshabelo have gone back to normal and passed the stage of gang violence. I was in Germany for the past few weeks and the first question I asked when I returned was how schools in Botshabelo were performing and the response I got was indeed pleasing. We are expecting some schools here to give us 100% in the matric exams, he said.Makgoe said the town had in the past given them sleep less nights as gang violence has escalated and disrupting classes. This is a very important area for us and we want only the best from our pupils. He said they would continue working around the clock to make sure class disruptions were totally eliminated in the province. What we want is for our people to focus on their schoolwork and nothing else. Botshabelo was in the past hit by massive violence where a gang known as Born to Kill (BTK) terrorised the community.BTK was identified as the gang that had menaced the peace and stability of the community.Acts of violence and intimidation between a gang and Botshabelo residents led to all 59 schools in the area closing down temporarily.Community members said, among other things, drugs, lack of sports facilities and unemployment were some of the contributors to the situation.There were other townships in the province such as Meloding in Virginia, Bultfontein and Dewesdorp where Makgomosha and Marastas were allegedly involved in gang activities.The situation was so severe even the executive council of the province regularly visited the area with the aim of stopping the violenceThen MEC for police, roads and transport, Butana Komphela, said it can never be correct to say people resort to crime as the result of unemployment.He said since Botshabelo had been declared a hot spot, they were going to make sure they used their powers to win this battle for safety and security of the community. The residents are sick and tired of the gun-toting and threatening behaviour of some individuals and the government will make sure that Botshabelo is a safer place for all who live in it.
