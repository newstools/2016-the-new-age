Patients in the Eastern Cape are bearing the brunt of a chronic shortage of health practitioners including doctors and nurses.Huge staff shortages and weak primary care are the two most pressing problems for the province and poor patients who solely depend on the state healthcare system are the ones who feel the pinch most.As a result, claims of negligence and the province s litigation battles now total R876m and range from children blinded at birth to pensioners dying from infections which their families claim they had acquired at hospitals.A patient, Shadrack Chiloane, said he was sent back after he visited Mthatha General Hospital seeking medical attention. My father was also told to come back the following year because a doctor was not available. You can imagine someone who wants to urinate but can t and the agony of being sent home without help because of a shortage of doctors, his daughter, Mabohle Chiloane, said.Mabohle said the family had to raise the money for Shadrack Chiloane to be sent to a private hospital where he got help.Last month, health practitioners belonging to various unions in the OR Tambo region threatened to down tools over gross shortages of staff.Unions have voiced their frustrations over the shortages which they say hampers service delivery and already overburdened staff.They claim efforts to engage with the department have drawn a blank, something they say will leave them with no choice but to down tools .Nurses belonging to the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa, Public Servants Association of South Africa and Health and Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa said the Eastern Cape has a gross shortage of nurses to a point where enrolled nurses would take the risk of running a ward in the absence of a registered nurse. In a country in crisis of gross shortage of hospital staff, we strongly feel that the Eastern Cape is the worst off. We have reached the point where you will see a trainee nurse taking on the risk of running a ward in the absence of a registered nurse, which is seriously disapproved of by the South African Nursing Council and in many instances where there is litigation, the department goes back and blames the trainee nurse who was only trying to help the department, the union spokesperson said.Eastern Cape health spokesperson Siyanda Manana confirmed the shortage, saying the situation is not peculiar to the Eastern Cape and is a phenomenon that exists throughout the world. The Eastern Cape has a social compact where we recruit students from rural areas and send them to Cuba to be trained there, Manana said. We have students annually coming back from Cuba to serve our people, especially in the rural areas. Social compact means they are identified by the community they come from and have a contract with the department to serve the community for the same number of years they have been funded by the department. Manana said it was wrong for people to be sent home without help as that is not departmental policy.His said any person who is turned away must report the matter to 0800032364. Turning a patient away is tantamount to denying his or her constitutional right of access to healthcare, Manana said.The unions said nurses run the risk of being sued but very often one nurse has to do a job which is equivalent to three nurses because of the staff shortage. We have opened more satellite training centres to train nurses. In Cuba we have more than 306 students studying to be doctors , Manana said.Manana said the department has an annual recruitment plan where posts are filled in institutions.He said clinical posts are critical and they take precedence.He rejected claims that interns work unsupervised saying: We don t have interns working by themselves. In some rural provinces such as the Eastern Cape, there are less doctors per population counts than some of our poorest neighbouring countries. The fact that we have been relying on foreign doctors and community service doctors to prop up the rural services confirms this, Manana said.INDIE BOYCEindiphileb@thenewage.co.za
