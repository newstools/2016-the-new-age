Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite on Tuesday invited centrist Saulius Skvernelis to form a new government, after his party of political outsiders surprised observers by winning the October general election.The 46-year-old former police chief and interior minister said his Peasants and Greens Union (LPGU) would focus on tackling social injustice while keeping the eurozone and NATO member firmly on a pro-Western track.He will replace leftist Algirdas Butkevicius whose ruling Social Democrats only managed to finish third in the election but agreed to join the new cabinet as a junior partner.The coalition will have a 78-seat majority in the 141-seat parliament. The lawmakers are expected to approve a new cabinet in the coming weeks. Conservatives and liberals will remain in opposition.Popular among rural voters, the LPGU won the election with pledges to tackle poverty and halt emigration, a vow to fight alcoholism and promises to change a controversial new labour code.-AFP
