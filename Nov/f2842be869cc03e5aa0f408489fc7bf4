AMID a series of shameful incidents of racism this week, the Cabinet yesterday condemned the incitement of racial tensions and violence by public figures.Following the Middelburg incident where farmers Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson allegedly kidnapped and assaulted Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa and forced him into a coffin, and a backlash by right wing groups against EFF leader Julius Malema s call for blacks to occupy vacant land, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe said: These racial tensions detract from our hard-won freedom.South Africans must condemn detrimental influences such as the racist assault of Mlotshwa which only serves to harm our fellow South Africans and does not add to the ubuntu (culture) of our nation Radebe warned that leaders should respect the rule of law and encouraged the public to speak out against illegal occupation of land.The call by the Cabinet comes at a time when the trial of a father and two sons accused of assaulting a construction worker is set to resume in the Groblersdal Magistrate s Court today.Johannes Frederick Fourie, 49, his sons, Johan, 25 and Quinton Fourie, 24, and a fourth man, Heinrich Coetzee, 34, face charges of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, pointing of a firearm and attempted murder.Headman Pati, 53, was dragged out of his truck and assaulted until he lost consciousness.Pati worked near the entrance of the accused s shop and asked Fourie to use an alternative route because the tar road was still wet due to roadworks. This triggered the alleged assault on him by the three suspects while another pointed a firearm at his co-workers to stop them from intervening. The matter could be finalised today if all parties are ready, National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson in Limpopo Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said.The latest incidents came as the government extended the deadline for submissions around its proposed Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill which intends to penalise racist acts with harsh sentences.Meanwhile, the South African Human Rights Commission yesterday said it was investigating the Mlotshwa case.Commission spokesperson Gail Smith lauded the swift action of the police in the Mlotshwa matter.The SA Jewish Board of Deputies national director, Wendy Kahn, said acts of humiliation and hate have no place in a multicultural and democratic South Africa. She called on all concerned citizens to speak out against incidents of racism and discrimination wherever they occur.-PETER RAMOTHWALA
