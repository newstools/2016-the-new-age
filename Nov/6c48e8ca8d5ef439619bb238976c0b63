A rape survivor whose husband colluded in her attack said instead of focusing on the problem over just 16 Days Of Activism in December, the country should be creating awareness throughout the year.CEO of Gauteng-based Empowering People in Crisis (Epic) Foundation which helps victims of rape Alta McMaster has turned her rape from a lifelong tragedy into a method to empower herself and use her ordeal to fight the scourge of rape and abuse of women and children.McMaster said her then husband had drugged her and agreed to allow one of his clients to rape her. I did not tell anyone of my rape, not knowing the negative effect it was having in my life. It was devastating to have been raped in my own home. My husband was on drugs and he could not afford to buy drugs so he was prostituting himself for drug money. One of his clients found out he was married and offered him double money if he could have me while my husband watched. I found myself semi-drugged and raped in my own home while my daughters were sleeping in the room next door, McMaster said.Having experienced trauma in her own life, McMaster has a deep understanding of how lonely and helpless one can feel if no one extends a helping hand.This has encouraged her to help others through empowering survivors of trauma.McMaster has been managing projects for rape survivors and others in Gauteng since 2011.She has established a wide network for distributing comfort packs for rape victims through small Victim Empowerment Centres that are linked to police stations and larger rape crisis/trauma centres.Meanwhile, women in Tembisa were this week encouraged to report cases of rape and violence to their nearest Legal Aid if police do not want to open a case, during a department of justice organised 16 Days of Activism event at the Rabasotho Community Hall.Advocate Caroline Foord from Legal Aid South Africa said they want women to know that they are available in their nearest malls to help them if they need to obtain a protection order against their abuser. We want women to stand up and say no to violence and to know that we are here to help them not only around this period but throughout the year. The painful part is that most women do not know about their rights and the steps they should take. We want them to know that they can come to our offices and they will get assistance for free, Foord said.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
