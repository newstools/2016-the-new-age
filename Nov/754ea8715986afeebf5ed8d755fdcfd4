Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is today expected to visit Paul Mosaka Primary School following the harrowing stabbing of the school principal by an expelled teacher yesterday.The principal, from the Pimville School in Soweto, is in critical condition after being stabbed multiple times upon arrival at school in the morning. The former teacher apparently gained entry by overpowering a female patroller on duty by pushing her to the ground. Once inside, he smashed the principal s car windscreen with a hammer and proceeded to stab the principal in full view of some pupils, department spokesperson Oupa Bodibe said. The department strongly condemns the alleged conduct of the former teacher and we wish the principal a speedy recovery. The examination schedule had to be suspended indefinitely yesterday following the incident, while staff and pupils affected were offered counselling.The former teacher was investigated for fraudulent qualifications in 2014 and dismissed last year. He was arrested yesterday and detained at the Kliptown police station. The 42 year old faces charges of attempted murder.The police s Kay Makhubela said the police were alerted to the attack by community members who tried to intervene and apprehend the male suspect. The motive was not clear, he said. At the moment it looks like the teacher took revenge after he was expelled. We will investigate to find out what lead him to come to the school, he said.LILLIAN SELAPISA| lillians@thenewage.co.za
