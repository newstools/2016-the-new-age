South Africa is leading African participants among 59 countries in the Trends in International Mathematics Science Study 2015 says Department of Basic Education Angie Motshekga on Tuesday.Motshekga expressed that she was proud that the countries education sector was leading in the study among African countries.&#8220;Firstly, let us acknowledge that South African scores in Mathematics and Science are low but improving. The study shows that South Africa has made the biggest improvement of any education system in the world since we have been participating in the study,&#8221; said Motshekga.This comes after the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) released the results in Pretoria, on the cross-national assessment of the mathematics and science levels of learners from the various participating countries.These are the imperative results to track educational progress and the health of the education sector and to identify interventions that need to be put in place to ensure improvements.According to the study, indicates a change in achievement between 2003 and 2015 showing that South Africa has the largest improvement of 87 points in Math and 90 points in Science.&#8220;The improved TIMSS scores should also be viewed in context of concentrated efforts and support provided in the senior phase. Historically, this phase has been a challenge for the sector,&#8221; said Motshekga.About 48 countries participated in Grade 4/5 science and maths, with 36 countries participating in Grade 8/9 maths and science study in 2015.South Africa&#8217;s TIMSS 2015 Grade 8/9 sample shows that 292 schools participate with 12 500 learners and 330 mathematics and science teachers.&#8220;Grade 9 level, the TIMSS 2015 results show that there were noteworthy improvements at the lower and top end of achievement scores.&#8220;The highest gains were achieved by learners at the lower end and the encouraging news is that 3.2% of Mathematics learners and 4.9% of Science learners can be categorised at the high levels of achievement (i.e. scoring over 550 points),&#8221; said Motshekga.South African Grade five learners participated in TIMSS for the first time.Meanwhile, the Grade 5 sample indicates that 297 schools participated with 10 932 learners, 297 mathematics educators and 10 493 parents/care givers.&#8220;At the Grade 5 level, our performance in the TIMSS Numeracy (TIMSS-N) study was below 400 points but it represents an important baseline from which we can harness valuable data on fundamental mathematical knowledge, procedures and problem-solving strategies of learners in the intermediate phase of schooling,&#8221; said Motshekga.Provincially, the results by showed a quite unique stories.&#8220;The decrease in provincial inequalities with the lower performing provinces demonstrating the biggest improvements in achievement shows that our targeted intervention programmes in selected provinces and districts are starting to bear fruit.&#8220;The analysis showed that since 2003, Limpopo had the highest Grade 9 average score increase, by more than 100 points, in Mathematics and Science,&#8221; said Motshekga.However, Gauteng had the highest scores at Grade 9, achieving above 400 points while Western Cape had the top position at Grade 5.Executive Director of the IEA Dr Dirk Hastedt concluded, Twenty years of trends offer three remarkable findings: gender gaps in achievement have narrowed, schools are now perceived to be safer places than in the past, and students consistently report high levels of self-confidence and enjoyment in mathematics. We are happy to convey such positive news.&#8221;The study indicated that boys had higher mathematics achievement in more countries than girls, of the TIMSS 2015 countries.&#8220;Boys had higher achievements in 18 countries, with an average difference of 9 points. Girls had higher achievements in 8 countries, with an average difference of 18 points.&#8220;23 countries had no difference between boys and girls in average mathematics achievements.&#8221;Meanwhile, Dr Vijay Reddy said: &#8220;In order to look at change in educational achievement we need to look at changes in home and school conditions.&#8221;-Keitumetsi Motlhale
