While you cringe in disgust, the man stands uninhibited, not because he is just another pervert but because he is suffering from a serious psychological disorder called Exhibitionism.Exhibitionism is something which is discussed every now and then, as a serious psychiatric disorder.What is it? Exhibitionism is an act of exposing genitals or sexual organs in public or to a stranger. The practice is either defined as a desire or sometimes a compulsion to expose genitals for amusement or for sexual satisfaction, which shocks the bystander.
