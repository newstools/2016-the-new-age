I&#8217;m tired of seeing a Ape in heels.&#8221;Whaling responded: &#8220;Just made my day Pam.&#8221;The comments were later deleted and both women&#8217;s Facebook pages were eventually taken offline, The Washington Post reported citing local media.Staffers at the Clay County Development Corp. told WSAZ that Taylor had been removed from her position.Barack Obama&#8217;s eight years in office have been marred by racial slurs against the nation&#8217;s first African American president and his family.Clay has a population of less than 500, according to the 2010 census, and is the seat of Clay County in West Virginia.The furor over the racist comment, and the mayor&#8217;s seemingly agreeable response, prompted an online petition drive to have the two women ousted.The text on www.thepetitionsite.com gathered nearly 160,000 signatures from across the country.Whaling had apologized in a statement Monday to The Washington Post, writing: &#8220;My comment was not intended to be racist at all.&#8221;Michelle Obama emerged as a hugely popular surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.Trump, a billionaire businessman, won West Virginia&#8217;s five electoral votes, helping him to his unexpected triumph over Clinton.-AFP
