The previously suspended editor of The Citizen, Steven Motale, has been dismissed with immediate effect the paper s senior management announced yesterday.In a statement to staff, publisher Eureka Zandberg said Motale s failure to follow agreed-upon editorial procedures and to uphold his editorial duties had led to an irretrievable breakdown in the relationship of trust and confidence between him and the publisher of the paper. This matter was not about the stories that were published in The Citizen. On the contrary, The Citizen upholds the highest standards of editorial freedom and fully endorses the editorial prerogative to determine what is and what is not published, Zandberg said.Speaking of his dismissal Motale said: My services as editor of The Citizen were terminated (yesterday) without any hearing. My legal team is handling the matter. TNA REPORTER
