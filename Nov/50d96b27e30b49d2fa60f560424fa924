After six years of hard work trying to break into the Absa Premiership, it looks like things are finally starting to work in favour of striker Edwin Sitayitayi at Highlands Park. The 24-year-old Sitayitayi is a product of Kaizer Chiefs academy and was promoted to the first team in 2010.But things didn t work out for him and a year later he was sent on loan to National First Division outfit Thanda Royal Zulu. He also spent some time on loan at Santos and last season with Moroka Swallows before making his way back to the top tier by signing for the Lions of the North at the beginning of the season The Highlands striker has managed to impress new coach Gordon Igesund but the coach expects more from the player.Sitayitayi is one of the players who continue to enjoy game time despite the coaching changes at the club after Igesund took control of the club three weeks ago. The coach has said he aims to help the striker take his game to another level as he believes he is capable of achieving great things. Sitayitayi is a good young player, it s not the first time I have seen him. I have watched him a lot at Moroka Swallows and when he was at Santos, Igesund said. I just think he works very hard and has a good attitude, he wants to learn. He has great touches and he can do things in the air with the ball. I am very pleased with him and looking forward to growing him from strength to strength. Igesund replaced Allan Freese following a string of poor results.The Lions of the North find themselves 12th on the log with six points from seven matches. Despite things not going that well for Highlands, Sitayitayi has not disappointed as he has consistently performed. Sitayitayi has featured seven times for Highlands Park in all competitions. The 24 year old has not only been performing well but has also found the back of the net two times.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
