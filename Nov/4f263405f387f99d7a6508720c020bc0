It&#8217;s tied with Michael Jordan for the fourth longest in NBA history.But Durant wasn&#8217;t bothered by the end of the streak.&#8220;It really didn&#8217;t mean a thing for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it was cool for the fans to see, but for me I was going out there and doing what I&#8217;m supposed to do.&#8220;It was cool while it lasted, up there with some great names, but I have bigger goals in mind.&#8221;Rookie Jamal Murray had 14 points to lead the Nuggets, who were coming off a five-game road trip and playing just their second home game in the first three weeks of the season.In Milwaukee, Anthony Davis scored 30 points as New Orleans won for the first time this season, beating Milwaukee Bucks 112-106 at the Bradley Center.Davis hit 12-of-25 shots and went eight-for-eight from the free throw line while also grabbing eight rebounds.He scored 12 of his points in the fourth quarter for the Pelicans, who shot 43.8 percent from the field.The Pelicans dropped their first eight games of the season.&#8211;AFP
