The head of the World Trade Organization said Thursday he had had no indication the United States would move to leave the WTO under Donald Trump&#8217;s administration.&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had any indication from anybody that that could be the case,&#8221; WTO chief Roberto Azevedo told reporters.During his campaign, which repeatedly attacked global trade deals, President-elect Trump called the WTO a &#8220;disaster&#8221; and said the US could quit the Geneva-based body.Azevedo stressed it was premature to speculate on what Trump may do in office.&#8220;I just don&#8217;t know what the trade policies are,&#8221; Azevedo said of the incoming administration.&#8220;I haven&#8217;t talked to him,&#8221; he added, when asked if he had spoken to Trump directly since the November 8 US vote.&#8220;What we have to do is be ready for a conversation&#8221; with Trump&#8217;s economic team, the Brazilian national added.Azevedo conceded that swathes of people worldwide had come to see global trade as a job killer even though such perceptions were not supported by evidence.He said any fixes to the broader globalisation project must not include reactionary, protectionist measures.&#8220;If the medicine is simply protectionism, the outcome will be that you harm the patient,&#8221; Azevedo said.-AFP
