&nbsp;South Africa stand-in captain Faf du Plessis has urged his charges to put the foot on the pedal in pursuit of an unprecedented series whitewash in Australia during next week s third and final Test in Adelaide.The Proteas crushed the hosts by an innings and 80 runs before lunch on the fourth day in Hobart yesterday to clinch the series with a day-night Test to spare.The win was also South African s third consecutive Test series victory Down Under, stretching back to 2008. That s the mission for us now. We want to do that (whitewash) very badly, Du Plessis said. The same with the ODIs (5-0 series win in South Africa in October); we won t just rest on our laurels and be happy with 2-1 or even 2-0. We have got Australia in a position where they are under pressure and won t let that go. It s hard enough to get them in this position so we will do everything we can to keep them there.
