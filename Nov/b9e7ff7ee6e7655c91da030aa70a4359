MOST people would expect Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt to be content with his team s strong start to the season, which has yielded the MTN 8 trophy and top spot in the league so far. But the Wits coach is not happy. Far from it.Instead Hunt has demanded more from his players as he feels they still need to prove themselves by winning the PSL. Hunt believes his team is no different from the crop he had in the past two seasons, the team which finished third and second in successive seasons. This team has got to prove itself, if it does better than last year s team and the year before then it s a better team, Hunt said. They have played 10 games in all competitions so far and this team has not done anything, yes we have won a trophy but we played three games to the final. I want us to win a 30 games trophy and that is the most important thing for me. You get judged based on the league not cup competitions. Last year we were second and the year before third. After six matches in the league, Wits have accumulated 16 points. Hunt is no greenhorn, but a coach with a great pedigree as a league winner having guided SuperSport United to three successive league titles.The MTN 8 title was Hunt s first trophy since taking charge of the Clever Boys four seasons ago. Hunt said the MTN 8 success showed that Wits have the potential to achieve big things. In the three games tournament we have shown potential of what can be achieved but that has to be done over a 10 to 11 months period. You need to keep the team going at training every day for that duration and that s when you know you will achieve. Wits are the only side yet to lose a match in the league and will look to keep their record intact when they travel to Platinum Stars on Saturday.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za
