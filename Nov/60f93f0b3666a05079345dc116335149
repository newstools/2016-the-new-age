The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has condemned recent attempts to invade land in areas such as Verulam and Puntans Hill in Morningside where a homeowner sustained second degree burns after her house was petrol bombed during last week s clashes over land. Demands for land are legitimate and the ANC prioritises responding to this need. Land is a key factor in addressing the challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment. The position of the ANC is that we defend our people s right to land but take a strong line against unlawful land invasions, ANC provincial secretary Super Zuma said.Clashes erupted in Puntans Hill after members of the Ethekwini Land Invasion Unit attempted to remove a group of people who tore down fences around homes in order to erect shacks. Informal settlements are a complex terrain and a major feature of urbanisation patterns especially with regard to eThekwini. There is often conflict between land invaders and formal residents, Zuma said.In Verulam, at least five farm workers were assaulted by an angry group after a mob blocked a road leading to a nearby farm demanding small-scale farmers operating at the farm vacate the area. With rapid urbanisation, this is going to be a continuous challenge that requires careful management, he said.While KZN police are attempting to establish if there were organisations or individuals inciting people, the invasions came soon after EFF leader Julius Malema addressed supporters in Newcastle. We will take our land, no matter what, Malema said shortly after the adjournment of his case in the Newcastle Magistrate s Court.Clive Ndou
