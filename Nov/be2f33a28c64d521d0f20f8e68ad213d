The African National Congress(ANC) Western Cape acting provincial chairperson Khaya Magaxa on Tuesday said Marius Fransman had undermined the work of the Integrity Commission by publicly attacking the committee.Magaxa told journalists, who attended the press briefing, that Fransman must conduct himself in a political mature manner. The Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) is concerned by Fransman&#8217;s conduct which has aggravated his suspension, he said.The acting chairperson further said that ANC leaders are not expected to take advantage of young women.The National Disciplinary Committee (NDC) of the ANC had earlier in the month suspended Fransman for 5 years.The NDC found former Western Cape provincial chairperson guilty of two counts of misconduct, for abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand and for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute. However, Fransman accused the Secretary General of the ANC Gwede Mantashe of being biased and that he was in support of regime change. If you are against regime change you will be dealt with but if you are for regime change you will be spared, he said.Fransman added that Mantashe was also using his office to further his political career.Meanwhile, Magaxa added that the Western Cape ANC will continue supporting Fransman but emphasised that they will not support him if he kept on undermining the organisation&#8217;s processes. If Fransman appeals his suspension he will remain chairperson until all processes are exhausted. No one will be replacing the chairperson for now, the deputy chairperson will act as chairperson, ANC Western Cape said.The party said Marius had been given a period of 21 days to appeal his suspension, according to the organisations constitution.-Sipho Jack
