Chippa United coach Dan Malesela believes his side is heading in the right direction despite going six games without a win.United slumped to their fourth league defeat, losing 1-0 to Orlando Pirates on Tuesday,another narrow defeat in as many matches.The Chilli Boys are known for playing an attractive brand of football under Malesela but their approach hasn t been yielding positive results.They last won a match two months ago when they defeated Baroka FC 4-1 in their away league fixture.It s been downhill ever since as they lost to Golden Arrows, drew against Bloemfontein Celtic and Platinum Stars before losing to Bidvest Wits, Cape Town City and Orlando Pirates.This poor run of results has seen them have drop to 10th spot on the log standings, their record reading two wins, three draws and four losses. A win will come. If we make a team like Orlando Pirates to defend so deep and play us on the counter then that means we are on the right track.It s just a matter of time before we turn the corner, Malesela said.Strangely, though, Malesela believes his men have drawn confidence from their dire situation. Instead of this result getting us down, it brings us confidence. The Chilli Boys will travel to Pietermaritzburg to face Maritzburg United who are recovering from a 3-2 loss to inform Cape Town City.Both clubs will be looking for a victory when they square off on Tuesday at the Harry Gwala Stadium.NTSAKO MASHABA news@thenewage.co.za
