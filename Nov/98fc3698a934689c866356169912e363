After their hard fought 1-0 win over Highlands Park at the Makhulong Stadium on Sunday , Golden Arrows defender Musa Bilankulu believes the win has boosted their morale as they face African Champions Mamelodi Sundowns at the Lucas Moripe stadium on Wednesday .Arrows have produced sterling performances in the past league games and it will not be a surprise to see them win against Sundowns. On the other hand, Sundowns is still playing catch up games after some of their league games were rescheduled due to their commitment in the Caf Champions League.The Brazilians are desperately looking for a victory to move up the log table. They have played four games, won two, lost one and drew one. Both teams are coming to this game with their confidence high after winning their weekend games.Bilankulu said they will give Sundowns a run for their money on Wednesday . It will not be an easy game but we will fight hard to win, said Bilankulu. The 31-year-old player said they need to continue winning games if they want to leapfrog log leader Bidvest Wits. We have to keep on winning so we keep chasing Wits. We want to go to December break on good points. Playing away from home is not easy and Johannesburg weather is a little bit of a problem for us,&#8221; he said.Arrows have 17 points from nine games so far. They lost two games, drew two and won five. Arrows performance so far proves right what coach Clinton Larsen said during the pre season that he wants to build a competitive team.-TNA Reporter
