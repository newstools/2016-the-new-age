Injured Paris St Germain striker Edinson Cavani rejected an offer to stay in France to recover from a thigh injury and is fighting to be fit for Uruguay&#8217;s World Cup qualifier at home to Ecuador, national team coach Oscar Tabarez said on Monday.The 29-year-old forward limped off shortly after scoring in the first half of Paris&#8217;s 4-0 win over Stade Rennais on Sunday, but Tabarez was hopeful of having him available for Thursday&#8217;s fixture in Montevideo after initial scans proved promising.&#8220;He felt some pain during the match he played in. It wasn&#8217;t when he made the goal but some time before,&#8221; Tabarez told reporters.&#8220;There was some contact or some suggestion from the people of Paris Saint Germain to do the recovery there and the player completely refused it.&#8221;Uruguay are second, one point behind leaders Brazil, in the 10-team South American standings, where the top four sides are guaranteed a place at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Tabarez, though, was wary of the challenge posed by Ecuador, who sit third in the standings and beat the Uruguayans 2-1 last year in the reverse fixture.&#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be easy, is it? In this qualifier, Ecuador got a lot of away points, more than 50 percent away (from home).&#8221;&#8211;Reuters
