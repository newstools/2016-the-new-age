Community leaders are urging residents in informal dwellings to practice caution when cooking on paraffin stoves this festive season.The call comes after several informal structures burnt down last year as a result of paraffin cooking appliances left unattended in Thembalethu and Borchers townships in George.Local leaders said shack fires were common during the Christmas holidays because most people were drinking and therefore leave paraffin stoves unattended.Yesterday community worker, James Jansen said that people who use paraffin stoves for cooking were at risk of causing fire accidents at this time of the year.Jansen said that to help avoid fire incidents, community leaders had to stand up and make an urgent call to all informal dwellers to be cautious and not to leave anything that can cause a fire unattended. It s this time of the year when people are drinking and enjoying themselves. There are a lot of activities and some people will be holding parties because they have money to spend. Sometimes the excitement has serious results when some people become careless when using paraffin stoves, he said.The Paraffin Safety Association of South Africa (PSASA) said overcrowded shacks with lots of furniture can burn easily.It also urged people to always remember that paraffin was dangerous and people should always follow safety tips to prevent accidents caused by burning paraffin.Among the safety tips PSASA warned people not to leave paraffin stoves on and unattended, and always to make sure that paraffin appliances were placed on a flat, solid surface so that they cannot be easily knocked over.Residents were also advised to have a bucket of sand nearby when using paraffin appliances to help put out a fire if necessary.Mpumi Kivaprovince@thenewage.co.za
