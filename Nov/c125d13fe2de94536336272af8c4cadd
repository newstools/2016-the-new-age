Patch-ups are usually difficult and don&#8217;t come easily after a really ugly argument. However, many of us try to fake a patch-up just in order to make things look normal, mostly for others, and sometimes for our own good. However, experts suggest never to attempt a fake one, since it is a sort of compromise that you tend to make with a situation.
