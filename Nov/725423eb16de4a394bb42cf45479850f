China has lodged a diplomatic protest with Singapore after a shipment of Singaporean military armoured vehicles being brought back from Taiwan was seized in Hong Kong, Beijing&#8217;s foreign ministry said Monday.Beijing stated its opposition to &#8220;any form of official exchanges with Taiwan, including military exchanges and cooperation&#8221;, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters, urging Singapore to &#8220;stick to the &#8216;One China&#8217; principle&#8221;.Taiwan is a self-ruling democracy but Beijing still sees it as part of its territory. Relations have grown increasingly tense since the island&#8217;s new China-sceptic president Tsai Ing-wen took power in May.The shipment of Terrex Infantry Carrier Vehicles and other Singaporean military equipment has been held in Hong Kong since last Wednesday due to a &#8220;request for routine inspections&#8221; by customs, Singapore&#8217;s defence ministry said.It added that the vehicles were used in overseas training exercises by the country&#8217;s military. No ammunition was on board.Media reports in Hong Kong and Taiwan said the vehicles were on their way back from a training exercise in Taiwan.Singapore and Taiwan have a longstanding defence agreement signed in 1974, &#8220;Project Starlight&#8221;, enabling Singaporean troops to train in Taiwan alongside Taipei&#8217;s forces. The city-state sends up to 15,000 troops a year to the island.But it has in recent years explored closer military ties with China, conducting a joint exercise in 2014.Hong Kong is semi-autonomous after being handed back by Britain to China in 1997 and enjoys freedoms unseen on the mainland, but there are increasing fears over Beijing&#8217;s interference.A commentary in China&#8217;s often-nationalist Global Times newspaper on Monday said it was &#8220;no longer reasonable&#8221; for Singapore to maintain military exchanges with Taiwan since it established formal diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1990.&#8220;For quite some time, Singapore has been pretending to seek a balance between China and the US, yet has been taking Washington&#8217;s side in reality,&#8221; it said.It accused the city-state of &#8220;hypocrisy&#8221; and threatened punitive measures that would &#8220;profoundly impact Singapore&#8217;s economy&#8221;.&nbsp;-AFP
