The African National Congress (ANC) National Disciplinary Committee (NDC) on Thursday suspended Western Cape chairperson Marius Fransman for five years.Fransman was found guilty on two counts of misconduct for abusing his office &#8220;for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand and for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute.&#8221;He was asked to step aside after sexual harassment allegations were levelled against him earlier this year. The NDC found that he did not show any political understanding of one of the fundamental objectives of the ANC. As a provincial leader in the ANC he should have known about the triple oppression of South African women and the giant strides being made by the ANC to accord women their rights and help them to overcome their oppression.The charged member deliberately misled the public when he said that he did not receive documents to enable him to prepare for his disciplinary hearing whereas in truth he was given all the relevant documents he needed to prepare his defence, NDC said in a statement.Meanwhile political analyst Sipho Seepe said the organisation needs to be seen to be acting strongly against people who are senior in the movement. People must not assume that they are beyond being reached, touched or being disciplined. It will win the ANC a certain space about the seriousness of dealing with misconduct, Seepe said.The NDC further accused Fransman of deliberately misleading the public when he said that he did not receive documents to enable him to prepare for his disciplinary hearing. Discipline is the glue that holds the ANC together. There is no room in the ANC for leaders and members, irrespective of position or seniority, who show scant regard for the values and objectives of the ANC and who consciously choose to define themselves outside the organisation in breach of their membership oath, the committee added.Professor Seepe said if Fransman felt that he was not treated fairly he still had an option to turn to the courts. When you chose not to participate you also leave the people in the committee no other choice but to simply say you do it because you running away, he added.On the issue of why the expelled member did not attend the hearing, ANC Western Cape spokesperson Yonela Diko said it was no secret that Fransman had been unhappy for a while with both the integrity committee and the NDC processes. The lesson we must take is that the ANC operates structurally, if you move from integrity commission to Disciplinary committee which receives it, then takes it to the NEC, which is how the ANC works. The ANC follows its communication by structure, Diko said.He said Fransman failed to follow structure and personalised some of the matters.-Sipho Jack&nbsp;
