Retail giant Spar Group has closed its distribution centre in Zimbabwe due to weak economic growth and will now supply independent stores from South Africa.The group announced this in the release of its preliminary results yesterday for the year ended September. Spar CEO Graham O Connor said that the exit of the group was propelled by the weak economy in Zimbabwe combined with payment issues as well as infrastructure issues.It also announced an overall good performance from their Southern African operations with a total operating profit of R2.6bn, up 12.3% from the previous year . Profit before tax was up 24.6% to R2.4bn boosted by the Southern African operations.There was also positive impact in the balance sheet through their Ireland division following refinancing in July last year. Headline earnings per share increased 22.1% to 1 020 cents. Cash generated from operations in the group rose to R3.3bn, however overall cash flow was negatively affected by an increase in trade receivables for the southern African operations.The operating profit of the Irish operations grew 41.4% to R433m while the southern African division experienced only 6% growth due to closure costs associated with the Zimbabwe division and net debt impairments.The turnover of Spar southern Africa increased 9.5% to R61.7bn underpinned by double digit liquor and building material sales growth. Furthermore, combined food and liquor wholesale turnover growth of 9.2% was well ahead of internally measured food inflation of 6.2%.New Tops stores opened during the year and the brand closed the year with 691 stores. The total retail space was up 9.3% for the period.The majority of stores converted to the new Tops at Spar logo and 36 stores were revamped. The liquor division had an increased retail turnover of R8.9bn.The board also approved a final dividend of 410c. with Reuters thelman@thenewage.co.za
