Donald Trump&#8217;s US election victory heralds the &#8220;building of a new world&#8221;, France&#8217;s far-right leader Marine Le Pen said Sunday in a BBC television interview that sparked immediate criticism in Britain.Le Pen described the Republican&#8217;s win as a &#8220;victory of the people against the elite&#8221; and said she hoped a similar outcome could be achieved in French presidential elections in May.&#8220;Clearly, Donald Trump&#8217;s victory is an additional stone in the building of a new world, destined to replace the old one,&#8221; she told the BBC&#8217;s flagship Sunday politics programme, the Andrew Marr Show.Trump &#8220;made possible what had previously been presented as impossible,&#8221; she said, predicting that the &#8220;global revolution&#8221; that resulted in his election, as well as in the vote for Brexit, will also see her elected as president.Hailing the rise of &#8220;patriotic movements&#8221; in Europe, Le Pen drew parallels between the US vote, Britain&#8217;s June 23 decision to leave the European Union, and France&#8217;s rejection of the European constitution in 2005.&#8220;All the elections are essentially referendums against the unfettered globalisation that has been imposed on us&#8230; and which today has clearly shown its limits,&#8221; she claimed.She said the French election would throw up the choice between a &#8220;multi-cultural society&#8230; where fundamental Islam is progressing&#8221; and an &#8220;independent nation, with people able to control their own destiny&#8221;.The interview sparked a backlash on social media as it fell on Remembrance Sunday, marking the contribution of British and Commonwealth forces during the two World Wars.&#8220;Some people are offended and upset that I have been to interview Marine Le Pen and that we&#8217;re showing this interview on Remembrance Sunday,&#8221; said Marr, defending the decision to run the piece.&#8220;I understand that but&#8230; Le Pen could, under some circumstances, become the next French president&#8230; I don&#8217;t think that the best way to honour the fallen is to fail to report on the next big challenge to western security.&#8221;-AFP
