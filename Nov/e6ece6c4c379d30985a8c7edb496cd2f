&nbsp;Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela is trying hard to mask the pain of having his team bombed out of yet another cup competition this season.Komphela endured nervy moments during the Telkom Knockout quarterfinal against Free State Stars in Durban at the weekend and this appears to have become his staple food, as the gods of football appear to have forsaken him and his team.On two occasions, Komphela ran towards the corner flag to celebrate with his players after Chiefs found the equaliser.Making his way to the bench, Komphela could be seen urging fans in the stands to cheer on his boys.The actions told the story of a man desperate to get his monkey off the back as far as bringing silverware to Naturena goes.But it was not to be as his side squandered scoring chances.Asked afterwards what it meant for him to be still searching for his first cup since arriving last season, he said: Every coach has a hunger for victory. The only thing that gets you going is if you win everything. We went into two cup finals last season and it was not good enough. Can you imagine if you don t even win a trophy. The nature of our business is pressure and to win games. Komphela added: It is just pity that we did not get the result, as in three previous three matches. Linda Ximba news@thenewage.co.za
