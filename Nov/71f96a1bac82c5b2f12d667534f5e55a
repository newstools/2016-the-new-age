President Barack Obama cautioned against dire predictions for Donald Trump&#8217;s presidency Monday, saying his Republican successor faces a reality check if he tries to enact his most controversial campaign promises.The outgoing Democratic leader made his comments at a wide-ranging news conference before he embarked on a farewell visit to Europe to reassure worried allies about a man he once warned was &#8220;unfit&#8221; to lead the United States.Trump&#8217;s election win last week over Hillary Clinton has been met with euphoria among his supporters, but also with a wave of protests across the nation that are unusual for the world&#8217;s leading democracy.The 70-year-old Republican billionaire &#8212; who takes office in just nine weeks &#8212; was holed up in his home office in Manhattan with his inner circle, working to shape his new administration.While admitting that he had &#8220;concerns&#8221; about his successor, the message Obama delivered on Monday was designed to comfort those still ill at ease with Trump &#8212; and a lesson for the billionaire populist in the art of the presidency.Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV star who has never held political office, has threatened to shake up America&#8217;s most important international relationships.But Obama said that deporting millions of immigrants, tearing up mutual defense treaties with NATO and Japan, and unraveling global deals on Iran&#8217;s nuclear program and the environment were not as simple as delivering tub-thumping rhetoric.&#8220;Regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up,&#8221; Obama said.&#8220;Reality has a way of asserting itself,&#8221; he added, offering his view that Trump is pragmatic rather than ideological.Obama said that during a meeting with Trump at the White House last week, he had told the president-elect that his actions can move markets, tanks and public sentiment.&#8220;I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter,&#8221; Obama said.&#8220;It&#8217;s really important to try to send some signals of unity, and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign.&#8221;&#8220;Do I have concerns? Absolutely. Of course, I have concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues. But the federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat &#8212; it&#8217;s an ocean liner.&#8221;&#8211; &#8216;Pragmatic&#8217; &#8211;Amid dire predictions about the end of the republic and the global order, Obama said that Trump&#8217;s inexperience in politics and lack of intellectual baggage could be an asset.&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he is ideological. I think ultimately he is pragmatic in that way,&#8221; he told reporters at his first news conference since the Republican mogul defeated his Democratic rival Clinton in last week&#8217;s presidential election.&#8220;And that can serve him well as long as he&#8217;s got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction,&#8221; he continued.Trump made his first two key appointments on Sunday &#8212; onetime Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus will be his White House chief of staff, and anti-establishment media firebrand Steve Bannon his chief strategist.The appointment of Bannon &#8212; the head of ultra-conservative Breitbart News who has championed the so-called &#8220;alt-right&#8221; perspective &#8212; has raised hackles, with Jewish and Muslim leaders expressing concerns.Asked about Trump&#8217;s choice of Bannon, Obama gave a pass. &#8220;It would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the president-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we&#8217;re going to try to facilitate a smooth transition,&#8221; he said.More cabinet-level appointments will be rolled out this week, Trump&#8217;s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told reporters in New York.Making the vital choices for Trump&#8217;s cabinet has sparked intense infighting, CNN reported, with one source calling it a &#8220;knife fight.&#8221;The New York mogul has also spent time calling world leaders as he begins to develop ties with America&#8217;s allies &#8212; and adversaries.&#8220;Getting his arms around foreign policy&#8221; is one of Trump&#8217;s four top priorities, along with health care, immigration and taxes, as he prepares for his first 100 days as president, Priebus said.&#8220;I see President-elect Trump being very calm and cool and collected. And prepared to lead the American people,&#8221; Priebus &#8212; seen as an establishment counter-weight to Bannon &#8212; told ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Good Morning America.&#8221;Obama said that Trump had already conveyed a &#8220;commitment to NATO&#8221; that seemed to run against his campaign promises.&#8220;In my conversation with the president-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,&#8221; Obama said.During a visit this week to Europe, and then Peru for a summit with Asia-Pacific leaders, Obama said he would be able to tell allies &#8220;there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America&#8217;s commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship.&#8221;&#8220;This is a time of great change in the world, but America&#8217;s always been a pillar of strength and a beacon of hope to peoples around the globe. And that&#8217;s what it must continue to be,&#8221; he said.-AFP
