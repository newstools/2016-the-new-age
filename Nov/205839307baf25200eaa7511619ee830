Freedom Front Plus(FFP) Chairman Pieter Groenewald has filed a complaint with the ethics committee in Parliament against Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF) leader Julius Malema on Tuesday.This is after Malema repeated his call for all land in South Africa to be returned to black people, saying that his party was not calling for the slaughter of white people, at least for now .He was speaking after he appeared in the Newcastle Magistrate&#8217;s court for contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act &amp; Trespass Act. The case was postponed to December 7.The Economic Freedom Fighter&#8217;s leader told the party&#8217;s supporters on Monday that they were demanding everything all land, sea and the resources that go with it to be handed over to black South Africans. They found peaceful Africans here. They killed them. They slaughtered them like animals. We are not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now. What we are calling for is the peaceful occupation of the land and we don t owe anyone an apology for that, Malema said.In addition he said they will share the land equally with white people but reiterated that they were visitors in the country and that visitors behave.Groenewald said the comment made by Malema is racial hatred and has a potential to create civil war in the country. When Julius Malema became member of Parliament, he took an oath that he will uphold the constitution and all other laws governing South Africa, so by inciting people to occupy land unlawfully he is breaking the law, he said.Meanwhile, Democratic Alliance(DA) spokesperson Phumzile Van Damme condemned Malema&#8217;s utterances saying the language was in violation of the democratic principle. We should, as South Africans, be focusing on building a none racial, none sexist South Africa as it is required by the constitution, Van Damme said.She however believes the land reform in the country must be sped up but emphasised that it must be done in accordance with section 26 of the constitution.Afriforum&#8217;s deputy CEO Ernst Roets said the leadership is not determined by the factual correctness of the statement nor is it determined by how much it is based on reality. Your success is based more on how populist you can be and how you can make emotional statements that can excite people regardless of whether the statement is accurate or not, Roets reiterated.He further said the Economic Freedom Fighter leader was trying everything to make sure he garners more votes.-Sipho Jack
