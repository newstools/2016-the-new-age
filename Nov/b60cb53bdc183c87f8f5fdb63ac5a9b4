Cuba s economic difficulties will be aggravated by the uncertainty regarding how US president-elect Donald Trump will deal with the thaw inherited from President Barack Obama.Experts consulted preferred not to speculate. But they did recommend that the Cuban authorities adopt all measures within their reach to cushion the blow and reinforce what has been achieved on the economic front with the outgoing US administration. In any case, Cuba will have to continue moving forward with its economic reforms and try to resolve whatever has clearly not functioned for decades and is within our reach to fix, Cuban economist P vel Vidal said.Vidal is studying the economic reforms implemented since 2008 by the government of Ra l Castro, which has been facing major difficulties this year due to liquidity problems and oil shortages caused by the political and economic crisis in Venezuela, this country s main trading partner and energy supplier.In the first six months of this year, GDP grew just 1%, half of what was expected. Further muddying the picture are the doubts with respect to the recently restored relations with the US, now that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was defeated by her Republican rival in the elections. With regard to Cuba, I don t think (Trump) will roll back the important steps taken by the Obama administration to normalise relations between the two countries, John Gronbeck-Tedesco, assistant professor of American Studies at Ramapo College said. But with a Republican-controlled Congress, it s harder to know when the US will fully commit to lifting the embargo and truly open up trade between the two countries, he said.The US embargo against Cuba, in place since 1962, consists of a complex web of laws that can only be fully repealed by Congress.Cuba sees the embargo as the biggest obstacle it faces to development and a normalisation of ties with its giant neighbour to the north.Since the start of the move towards reestablishing bilateral ties, in December 2014, Obama has taken measures to undermine the embargo and attempted to protect his efforts by means of Presidential Policy Directive 43 on the normalisation of relations between the US and Cuba, issued on October 14.He even took an enormous symbolic step on October 26, when for the first time in 25 years the US abstained in the UN vote on the resolution that Cuba has presented annually since 1992, condemning the US embargo, which it blames for $125bn (R1.8 trillion) in losses.Obama said his aim was to make the opening to Cuba irreversible . But just a week before the election, Trump said: We will cancel Obama s one-sided Cuban deal, made by executive order, if we do not get the deal that we want and the deal that people living in Cuba and here deserve, including protecting religious and political freedom. But the business community and Cuban-Americans are largely in favour of the thaw, as analysts have been pointing out.In Gronbeck-Tedesco s view, the US will continue treating Cuba and Venezuela as separate political issues. And since Venezuela is still suffering from economic and political uncertainty, Trump s plans would not appear to include an improvement in relations with Venezuela or help in rebuilding that country. In a reaction that observers like Vidal describe as tardy , Havana appears to be pushing for more foreign investment, especially in the energy industry, which is heavily dependent on the shrinking deliveries of Venezuelan crude. The tendency is for foreign investment in energy to pick up speed. There are a large number of projects in different stages of progress to use renewable sources, mainly wind and solar power, Juan Manuel Presa from Cuba s Ministry of Energy and Mines, said.The engineer said the industry is seeking a diversity of partners in a diversity of formulas: external financing of Cuban projects, companies that are made up 100% of foreign capital, and the new legal status of mixed Cuban and foreign companies .Cuba is still far from its goal of drawing $2.5bn a year in foreign investment the amount needed to put the economy on a steady footing. The 83 projects approved since a new law on foreign investment went into effect in 2014 have attracted just $1.3bn so far.But to some extent, the thaw is easing the tense economic situation in this country.Between $2 and $2.5bn in remittances from abroad flow into Cuba annually, mainly coming from the Cuban-American community Cuban economist Juan Triana said.Only exports of medical services bring in more hard currency revenues, he said.Another major source of hard currency is tourism. Cuba s colonial cities and white sand beaches are experiencing an unprecedented tourism boom, with the number of visitors from the US growing every month, despite the fact that they can only travel here under one of 12 approved categories, such as family visits, academic programmes, professional research, journalistic or religious activities.In the first half of this year, Cuba received 2147912 visitors from abroad, including 136913 from the US. This latter number was 80 % higher than the total for the first half of 2015, according to the national statistics office, ONEI.In that period, tourism brought in more than $1.2bn, only counting public installations, not the growing private sector, which rents out rooms and runs taxis and restaurants.Cuban economist Ricardo Torres showed IPS a novel analysis on the US president-elect, who was widely criticised during the campaign for his racist, xenophobic and misogynistic remarks. There are three aspects (of Trump) that could benefit relations with Cuba, the academic researcher said. As a businessman, he could be inclined towards pragmatic policies that favour business interests, he said. He doesn t have a personal history against Cuba, and as a Republican he doesn t have a complex about appearing weak. Since he doesn t have prior experience in public office, a large part of his decisions will be reached with the advisers who surround him. Ivet Gonz lezIvet Gonz lez is an IPS correspondent
