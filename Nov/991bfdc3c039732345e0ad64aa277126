NATO head Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday said he was sure Donald Trump would live up to all US commitments to the alliance, just days after urging the president-elect not to go it alone.&#8220;President-elect Donald Trump stated during the election campaign that he is a big fan of NATO,&#8221; Stoltenberg said in Brussels as he arrived for talks with EU defence ministers.&#8220;And I am certain that he will be a president&#8230; who will live up to all the commitments of the United States in the alliance, because a strong NATO is important for Europe but it&#8217;s also important for the United States.&#8221;Trump&#8217;s upset election badly rattled nerves in Europe after he appeared to call into question Washington&#8217;s near 70-year security guarantee by saying he would only help NATO allies if they paid their way.He also appeared to be much more friendly towards Russia, praising President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader in marked contrast to a weak Barack Obama in Washington.Asked about a telephone call between Trump and Putin on Monday in which the Kremlin said they agreed to improve relations, Stoltenberg denied this was cause for concern.&#8220;First of of all, I think it is a very normal thing that president-elect Donald Trump speaks to world leaders, including of course the leader of Russia,&#8221; he said.&#8220;The message from NATO has been that we want dialogue with Russia &#8230; Especially when tensions are high, especially when we face many different challenges, it is important.&#8221;Stoltenberg&#8217;s upbeat tone came despite his stark warning in Britain&#8217;s Observer newspaper on Sunday, in which he wrote that &#8220;going it alone is not an option&#8230; this is no time to question the partnership between Europe and the United States.&#8221;But the NATO chief noted Tuesday that the two sides were on the same page, saying Trump&#8217;s call for the allies to increase defence spending was exactly what they were already doing.&#8220;I absolutely agree with him; that has been the message from US leaders for many years,&#8221; Stoltenberg said.&#8220;The good thing is that we now see that Europeans are actually investing more in defence&#8230; therefore contributing to better burden sharing,&#8221; he said.Washington accounts for nearly 70 percent of NATO defence spending and has long urged its European allies to do more, stepping up the pressure after Russia&#8217;s intervention in Ukraine.The Ukraine crisis shook NATO out of years of complacency and defence cuts, with leaders agreeing to its biggest military build-up since the end of the Cold War based on a commitment to devote two percent of national output to defence.The European Union &#8212; of whose 28 members 22 also belong to NATO &#8212; is also boosting military cooperation and on Monday approved a defence roadmap to boost the bloc&#8217;s capabilities.On Monday, US President Barack Obama said he was sure Trump would stand by US security commitments and that he would tell Europe there would be &#8220;no weakening&#8221; of the relationship.-AFP
