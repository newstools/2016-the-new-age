Manchester United have not given up on their Premier League title hopes yet despite dropping eight points behind leaders Liverpool, midfielder Michael Carrick has said.United have made a mixed start under manager Jose Mourinho and have drawn criticism for their lack of killer-instinct in front of goal, having scored 16 times in 11 league games.&#8220;We want to be at the top challenging. We&#8217;ve had some ups and downs along the way, it&#8217;s not to say that we&#8217;ve given up on winning things just yet,&#8221; Carrick told Sky Sports.&#8220;It&#8217;s too early for that and we&#8217;ve got too much quality and too much of a good team and squad to give up on anything.&#8220;We just don&#8217;t feel we&#8217;ve got the results our performances have warranted; we know it can change&#8230; there&#8217;s still so much to play for and we still believe that when it comes near the end and when it counts we&#8217;ll be right up there.&#8221;Next up for United is a clash against fourth-placed Arsenal and Carrick hoped his team would make a statement of intent against the Gunners at Old Trafford on Saturday.&#8220;Arsenal have got some really good players. When it clicks for them they are a very dangerous team and they&#8217;ve shown in their start to the season how dangerous they can be,&#8221; he added.&#8220;But I think we can be quite dangerous as well and we probably haven&#8217;t quite clicked into top gear which, in some ways is a good thing, because we know there&#8217;s plenty to come.&#8221;&#8211;Reuters
