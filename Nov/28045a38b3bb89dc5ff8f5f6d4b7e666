Ethekwini residents are more concerned about how government is tackling day to day issues rather than the current factional battles within the ANC, a ruling party city councillor told delegates at the Mahatma Gandhi Awards ceremony in Durban.Sipho Kaunda, who welcomed guests on behalf of eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede, said the poor were more concerned about the delivery of quality services. They are not interested in the factions and ideological battles. Our duty is to refocus our energy and the spear of Gandhi. We are deeply disturbed by the scenes of violence on our campuses, burning of libraries and the brutal use of force by the police, he said.Former public protector Thuli Madonsela and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan were among those who were honoured.The Gandhi Development Trust (GDT) recognised Gordhan and Madonsela at a time when the two are in the spotlight following the latest political developments in the country.Madonsela s State of Capture report, investigating the influence of the Gupta family over government leaders, is under public scrutiny with some labelling its contents as uncontested hearsay while others see it as an expos on corruption.Despite criticism of her report by many in the ANC and the ANC Youth League, Madonsela told the SABC she stood by her report and the document was a product of her best efforts. I know that I have done the best that I could with this report, as a human being. As we completed this report, I knew there would be people who would be happy that this strengthens constitutional democracy and sheds some light on a very difficult issue, she said.Gordhan, who could not attend due to ill health, was conferred the Mahatma Gandhi Satyagraha Award for his contribution to promoting integrity and commitment in his various roles while Madonsela was recognised for the courage and integrity she displayed while she was the public protector.The Gandhi awards ceremony, an annual event organised by the GDT, also saw civil activist, Bernard Lafayette and former Constitutional Court judge, Albie Sachs being honoured.Gordhan, who has been implicated in the formation of a rogue unit with the South African Revenue Services, is regarded by many as a victim of forces within the country wanting to take over control of the treasury for their personal interests.According to some reports, Gordhan, who had fraud charges against him withdrawn by the National Prosecution Authority last week, may still face charges relating to the rogue unit.Clive Ndouprovinces@thenewage.co.za
