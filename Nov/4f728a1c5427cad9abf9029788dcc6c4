A syndicate of illegal miners operating in the old Durban Deep mine, west of Johannesburg, have resorted to stealing cables because their operations to retrieve gold were unsuccessful. City Power revealed this after a suspect was caught attempting to steal electricity cables at Main Reef, Cresswold Park, on Sunday. The power utility said the alleged suspect had been linked to another cable theft incident in Roodepoort. Authorities have received intelligence with specific details about the syndicate involved and are closing in on the leads. About 45% of power outages in City Power s areas of operation are caused by cable theft creating a considerable challenge to service delivery efforts, City Power spokesperson Yumna Sheik, said. She said the utility had installed poles to ground sleeves and aerial bundled conductors across Johannesburg to deter thieves from cutting cables and bare overhead conductors.Aerial bundled conductors are made of aluminium and are of no value to cable thieves. Cable theft is estimated to cost the South African economy about R5bn a year directly and indirectly. Apart from the cost of replacing the infrastructure and damaged equipment, cable theft contributes to increased electricity tariffs for ordinary South Africans.The government has also tabled a Criminal Matters Amendment Bill which seeks to impose more stringent sentences to suspects convicted of cable theft. Under the new law, convicted offenders can get up to 102 years in prison for cable theft. The utility has been conducting educational awareness campaigns in communities most affected by cable theft and engaging with private security firms and the police to help the public understand the impact of theft and vandalism on electrical infrastructure.The utility has its own response vehicles patrol high-risk areas, however, because of the large areas, it is difficult to prevent every incident without assistance from affected communities.ntombin@thenewage.co.za-Ntombi Nkosi
