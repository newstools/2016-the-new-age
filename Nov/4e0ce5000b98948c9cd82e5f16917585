A NEW shock device implanted under the skin of a patient without a single wire touching the heart is a first in sub-Saharan Africa.The new device to prevent sudden cardiac death was implanted on patient Jan Wiehman, 55, of Welgemoed, Bellville on Monday at Mediclinic Panorama.He became the first patient in Africa to receive a subcutaneous shock device, also known as a subcutaneous cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD).The device is 83.1mm wide, 69.1mm high and 12.77mm thick, weighs 130g and is implanted in a space between two muscles on the left side of the patient s body.Dr Razeen Gopal, cardiac electrophysiologist at Mediclinic Panorama who completed the procedure, explained that sudden cardiac arrest was a serious, life-threatening medical emergency that occurred abruptly and without warning.When this occurs the heart s electrical system malfunctions and the heart is no longer able to pump blood effectively to the rest of the body.When the brain is deprived of blood it causes the person to lose consciousness quickly and if the heart is not shocked back into normal rhythm in less than three minutes, brain damage and death can occur. The Emblem S-ICD system is the first and only FDA approved product with both the device and the leads inserted beneath the skin, with no leads inserted through any veins and thus with no leads placed inside or even touching the heart at all, Gopal said. This leaves the heart and blood vessels untouched and so provides a safer alternative to conventional implantable defibrillators without the complications associated with cardiac wires. He said unlike traditional implantable defibrillators, it does not require leads in the venous system, eliminating potential sources of complications related to such leads or pockets, the most feared being infection.Gopal said for those at risk of sudden cardiac arrest, one treatment option was an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), which may prevent sudden cardiac death.The implanted device can sense arrhythmias (irregular heart beat) and deliver strong electrical shocks to the heart to restore a normal heart rhythm, also known as sinus rhythm. ICD therapy has been shown to effectively stop 95% or more of dangerously fast heart rhythms. With an ICD device, 19 out of 20 people will survive sudden cardiac arrest. &#8211; VINCENT CRUYWAGEN
