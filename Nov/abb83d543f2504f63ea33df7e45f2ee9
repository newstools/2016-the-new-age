Football global governing body FIFA insisted Friday it was a &#8220;distortion of the facts&#8221; to suggest they would punish British national associations determined to mark this weekend&#8217;s World Cup qualifiers with poppy tributes.Both England and Scotland pan to defy what they believe to be a FIFA ban on the wearing of poppies, a national symbol honouring war dead, when their teams meet at Wembley on Friday.The latest edition of international football&#8217;s oldest fixtures takes place on November 11 -Armistice Day in Britain as it marks the anniversary of the end of the First World War on November 11, 1918.Players wearing the poppy symbol on their shirts would appear to contravene FIFA regulations forbidding the display of messages considered to be commercial, personal, political or religious.Officials at both England&#8217;s Football Association and the Scottish Football Association have tried to find out just what sort of punishment they could face, amid fears of fines or even points deductions.But a FIFA spokesperson told AFP on Friday it could only act on actual events.&#8220;FIFA was recently contacted by the four British FAs (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) with specific requests related to the wearing of &#8216;poppy symbols&#8217; by the players during the upcoming FIFA World Cup qualifying matches,&#8221; said the spokesperson.&#8220;FIFA s administration does not have the jurisdiction to take any such decision.&#8220;The proper body tasked with ensuring the uniform application of the Laws of the Game is the independent disciplinary committee.&#8220;FIFA&#8217;s administration provided information to the four British FAs without making any judgements regarding their specific requests, so the perception that FIFA &#8216;banned&#8217; anything is a distortion of the facts.&#8221;The spokesperson added: &#8220;Law Four was created by the International Football Association Board (made up of the four British FAs and FIFA)) to provide an equal framework for all members by making it clear that players equipment must be free of political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images.&#8221;Hours before Friday&#8217;s kick-off at Wembley, a wreath of poppies was laid on the turf.&#8211;AFP
