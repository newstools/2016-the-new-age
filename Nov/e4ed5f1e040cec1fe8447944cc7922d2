Chippa United are at it again. The Port Elizabeth side failed to meet their obligation to reach a settlement with their player Philani Shange. THE former AmaZulu and Golden Arrows star lodged a complaint with the PSL after Chippa terminated his contract while he was injured. The matter was being handled by the PSL Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) with the help of the SA Football Players Union.A member of the union, who is not authorised to speak the media, said Chippa promised to settle a payment for Shange last month but did not. We have since alerted the PSL about Chippa not honouring their obligation. They promised to look into the matter and hope the matter is resolved speedily, the union member said. Shange, who has recuperated fully and is keeping fit with an amateur side back home in Durban, confirmed the latest developments but referred further queries to the union.This is not the first time Chippa have stalled in settling a dispute with a former employee. They were embroiled in a pay dispute with coach Roger Sikhakhane after they had terminated his contract on allegations that he reported for duty under the influence of alcohol. Sikhakhane took the matter to court which ruled in his favour.In the end, he was paid what was due to him and moved on to join National First Division side Thanda Royal Zulu in KwaZuluNatal. In another dispute involving Chippa, Joseph Malongoane s DRC case has been postponed to December 1. The winger took Chippa United to the DRC to demand his clearance and pave his way to join Kaizer Chiefs, having allegedly signed a pre-contract with the Soweto giants. However Chippa are adamant that the player belongs to them, saying he still has a running contract with the club.news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
