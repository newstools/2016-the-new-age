The country will need an additional 1.5 million tons of maize to finish off the farming year, Agbiz has said.South Africa has already imported 2.7 million tons of maize this year in an effort to mitigate the effects the drought had on crop production.South Africa consumes 10.5 million tons of maize annually and only produced 7.5 million tons last season, creating the need for imports.Agbiz economist Wandile Sihlobo said only 51% of white and yellow maize the country needed has been imported so far from Argentina and Mexico. We are yet to see the remaining imports come in the remaining months running up into 2017 April.We should see about 1.5 million tons of maize to make sure South Africa fares well, Sihlobo said.About 434 779 tons of white maize came from Mexico while 942 549 tons of yellow maize was from Argentina.GrainSA CEO Jannie de Villiers said it was clear that the South African position is very tight on inventory levels at the end of the season. It is clear that much grain still needs to be imported to balance the numbers. There is yellow maize available on the world market for imports.There is also white maize available in the US, but it is uncertain whether it can be imported due to protocol registration, de Villiers said.Sihlobo is upbeat that the coming season could be better. He said some farmers in Mpumalanga, KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape had already started planting. We are seeing good rains in some part of the country, some farmers have already started planting in Mpumalanga (70%), KZN (70%) and Eastern Cape (30%).With the rain in the eastern parts of the country it is looking well, in the western parts, they have up to midDecember to plant, he said.Sihlobo said, according to the weather forecast, weather conditions could normalise and the maize situation could be better. If all goes well, next year things could get better and we could see food inflation come down, he said.In a normal season, South Africa harvests 12.5 million tons of maize and was traditionally a net exporter of maize.mtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
