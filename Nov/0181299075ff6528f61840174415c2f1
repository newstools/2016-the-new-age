Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is seeking legal advice after claims, allegedly by former African National Congress(ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor, that R42bn went missing from her department.The Minister&#8217;s spokesperson Troy Martens told ANN7 that they have not yet verified whether the Facebook account, where the allegations were made, indeed belongs to Mentor. We have not contacted her personally but we have seen the post. The Minister is meeting with her lawyer to talk about the way forward, Martens said on Thursday.Mentor allegedly made claims that R42bn went missing from the department&#8217;s financial year and that Motshekga&#8217;s son was spotted driving a Lamborghini.The Minister dismissed her claims as &#8216;blatant lies&#8217; saying that the allegations were only seeking to tarnish her personal reputation and as the Minister. These lies have absolutely no basis in the truth and are a weak attempt to besmirch the reputation of the Minister, Martens said.The department added that Mentor&#8217;s utterances were not only hurtful but were also defamatory and completely unnecessary. The Minister cannot let these lies go unchallenged that seek to undermine the immense progress that has been made in terms of infrastructure delivery and tarnish her own reputation. The allegations therefore are completely unfounded and demand of her to clear her name, Martens said.Mentor is no stranger to controversy, she had earlier this year made claims that she was offered a Ministerial job by the members of the Gupta family.She was dropped as ANC caucus chairperson in 2010. In December 2010, then Minister of Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba disclosed in a reply to a parliamentary question that Transnet had paid R 133 000 for Mentor, in her capacity as a committee chairperson to fly to China.-Sipho Jack
