It may not be the tactical acumen of Augusto Palacios but rather his calm demeanour which brings success for Orlando Pirates.Palacios s calmness and easiness is in contrast with predecessor Muhsin Ertugral, who was all about authority.Even though he is often incomprehensible, Palacios, the interim coach, still gets the key message through to his players.The Peruvian knows Pirates well enough to exude calmness and create a positive atmosphere, which in turn brings out better performances, commitment and ultimately positive results.It was a positive start to the season for Palacios as he guided the Buccaneers to a 1-0 league win against plucky Free State Stars at the weekend, a second successive victory after the Telkom Knockout quarterfinal win last week. Tendai Ndoro again proved the difference for Bucs, scoring the solitary goal. When players are sad then suddenly there are funerals at home, flat tyres, stomach aches. It s all mental, Palacios said. This is not a club. It s a brand. It doesn t become a brand overnight. It needs work. If you don t want to work, stay home. When I m enjoying myself working, the players will enjoy themselves. When the players enjoy then there are no typical South African problems. I m a different coach, I know when to shout, when to swear and when to laugh. The players need to be treated differently. When they are relaxed, players are able to express themselves. Ndoro will again carry the hopes of the Buccaneers when they visit Chippa United in Port Elizabeth tomorrow. kgomotso Sethushakgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
