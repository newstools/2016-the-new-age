Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) on Monday said former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&#8217;s recommendation that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng appoint a judge to chair Commission of Inquiry on State Capture, undermines President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s powers.General Secretary of the police union Nkosinathi Theledi on Monday said despite President Zuma being implicated in the State Capture report, that alone does not absolve him from appointing the judge which will chair the Commission of Inquiry.The comments were made as Popcru was sharing the outcomes of its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting convened last week.&#8220;Zuma is constitutionally the person who has to appoint a commission of inquiry and if there needs to be a commission into State Capture, President Zuma still has to make the appointment,&#8221; said Theledi.&#8220;The constitution is clear when it comes to appointing judges to head judicial commissions, it has to be President Zuma,&#8221; continued Theledi.Theledi also added that an investigation that excludes white monopoly capital advances the view that only black people are corruptible. He said the so called state capture isn&#8217;t a new phenomenon. Ruperts, Oppenheimers are tied to the state and economy. The report shouldn&#8217;t be narrowly advanced, Theledi added. Popcru&#8217;s general secretary told journalists that state capture should be looked at holistically.Meanwhile the President last week Friday announced that he would be taking Madonsela&#8217;s State of Capture report on judicial review.Last week during a Question and Answer session in the National Assembly, Zuma raised questions about the report, in particular misgivings about the remedial action which says Zuma should establish a Judicial Commission of Inquiry, which should be chaired by a judge nominated by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng.&#8220;The manner in which the recommendation is, it is the president who has the right to appoint a commission. No one, no matter what position they hold, can instruct the President to establish a commission and even set the process through which he must go. It&#8217;s very funny,&#8221; said Zuma.Popcru on Monday however hesitated to make any pronouncements related to the expected outcomes of the ongoing ANC NEC meeting only going as far as saying the union supported the collective leadership of the ANC.&#8220;Our support for President Zuma has always been based on principle and we will engage the ANC in-house about our views on what is happening in ANC as Popcru,&#8221; said Deputy President Nkosinathi Mabhida.Popcru said it would only make a pronouncement once the ANC NEC meeting had come to a conclusion.Reports emanating from the ANC NEC allege that a motion of no confidence was tabled by Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom backed by some of his Cabinet colleagues including Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, his deputy, Joe Phaahla, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, Post and Telecommunications Minister Siyabonga Cwele and Rural Development Minister Gugile Nkwinti.ANC Gauteng provincial chairperson Paul Mashatile, chief whip Jackson Mthembu and economic transformation committee chair Enoch Godongwana also supported the motion.-TNA Reporter
