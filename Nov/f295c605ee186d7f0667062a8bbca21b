Arab leaders must treat the region&#8217;s 100 million young people as an asset, not a liability, the UN&#8217;s youth envoy said in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.&#8220;This is a generation that is so willing to contribute,&#8221; but is beset by obstacles in the 22-nation region plagued by conflict since a wave of Arab uprisings demanding reform erupted after late 2010, Ahmad Alhendawi told the MiSK Global Forum.Releasing figures from a forthcoming study, he said the region&#8217;s average age is below 25 &#8212; but the average age of Arab world politicians is 58.&#8220;This region has the highest rate of youth protest if you compare it to all other regions in the world,&#8221; said Alhendawi, a Jordanian named to the post in 2013.He said two-thirds of Arab women are looking for jobs.A separate report by the United Nations labour agency in August showed that Arab states count the world&#8217;s highest youth unemployment rate, above 30 percent.Overall, the region needs to create 60 million jobs by 2020, Alhendawi said.Even though that figure seems unreachable, he said the region should establish &#8220;an enabling environment&#8221; which would make it easier for young people to start businesses, and where they are seen &#8220;as an asset, not as a liability&#8221;.At the moment, starting a new business &#8220;is almost a mission impossible&#8221;, he told the forum which brings business leaders together with young Saudis in a bid to inspire their involvement in diversification of the kingdom&#8217;s oil-dependent economy.Alhendawi said young people&#8217;s use of social media shows &#8220;they are interested in politics and they are interested in public life&#8221;, though not in the formal institutions of government.He said the Arab world itself contains the solutions to its problems.&#8220;This is our region,&#8221; he told the hundreds of delegates. &#8220;We have to reclaim it.&#8221;The forum, which continues on Wednesday, is organised by the MiSK Foundation which aims to generate youth initiative.It was founded by 31-year-old Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who in April launched the wide-ranging Vision 2030 plan for enhancing the role of the private sector as part of economic diversification.-AFP
