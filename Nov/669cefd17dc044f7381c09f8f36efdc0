Energy major Royal Dutch Shell announced Tuesday that it rebounded into the black in the third quarter, aided by rising output and write-offs that were not repeated. Earnings after taxation hit $1.4 billion (1.3 billion euros) in the three months to September, against a net loss of $7.4 billion last year, when it was rocked by vast write-downs after scrapping projects in Alaska and Canada. Chief Executive Ben van Beurden cautioned however that ultra-low oil prices continued to be a “significant challenge” across the business and sparked an “uncertain” outlook for the London-listed group. -AFP
