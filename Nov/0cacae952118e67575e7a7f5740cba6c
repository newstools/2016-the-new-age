The troubles that the Springboks have had to endure this year have England confident that they can put Allister Coetzee s men to the sword when the two teams meet at Twickenham on Saturday.The 1995 and 2007 world champions showed some improvements last Saturday when they fought to a gutsy draw against the Barbarians, proving that they are not going to roll over and die against Eddie Jones side.Given how England have been playing, winning their nine matches this year and beating teams like Australia, Italy, France, Wales and Ireland, the Boks will need more than just talent and tactics to win.Eighth-man Warren Whiteley has acknowledged that England are a big threat, but said there are no special plans that the Boks will put in place. They have threats all over the field. As a side, we really respect them. We are going through our processes and what we need to do. We never look at individual players but the team we are playing against. This is a strong England team and we will have to be at our best to get a result, Whiteley said. Last week showed us that there are some great youngsters waiting to come in. The depth is great. The results may have not gone our way, but we have what it takes. England coach Jones has already managed to put one past South Africa last year at the World Cup when he was in charge of Japan.Coetzee will announce the team to face England today.Mmasekepe Matsebanemmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
