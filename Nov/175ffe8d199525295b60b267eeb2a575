Germany&#8217;s flagship carrier Lufthansa said it would cancel nearly 900 flights on Wednesday because of a strike by pilots, causing travel disruption for tens of thousands of passengers in the latest escalation of a long-simmering pay dispute.The stoppage, called by the pilots&#8217; union Cockpit, would start at midnight and affect Lufthansa flights at airports across Germany.Out of its roughly 3,000 scheduled flights, 876 would be cancelled due to the strike, &#8220;affecting some 100,000 passengers&#8221;, Lufthansa said in a statement.It is the union&#8217;s 14th strike since April 2014.Cockpit had initially called for a 24-hour stoppage but said late Tuesday that the strike would continue into Thursday for both long- and short-haul flights leaving Germany.Meanwhile a separate walkout by cabin crew at Lufthansa&#8217;s low-cost airline Eurowings led to the cancellation of more than 60 flights at airports in Hamburg and Duesseldorf on Tuesday.The industrial action was called by Germany&#8217;s biggest services union Verdi in a row over pay and working conditions.The Lufthansa pilots going on strike are demanding a pay rise of an average of 3.66 percent per year, retroactive for the past five years.The union says pilots have endured a wage freeze over that time and suffered a &#8220;significant loss of purchasing power&#8221; due to inflation, while Lufthansa has made billions in profits.It had offered a 2.5 percent wage hike.-AFP
