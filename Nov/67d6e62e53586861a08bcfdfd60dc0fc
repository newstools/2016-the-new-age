At leats 17 Zimbabwean nationals are reportedly receiving military training in Mozambique in a bid to topple President Robert Mugabe s regime.The information emerged following the arrest of six Zimbabweans intercepted and arrested on October 15 for illegally migrating into South Africa through Botswana to receive military training.The suspects Deliwe Nhatare, 34, Stallone Maticha, 22, Monyaradzi Paul Makina, 28, Nyarai Moyo Mangenah, 34, Meluleki Thebe, 28, and Vincent Moyo, 33, are still in custody after appearing in the Phalala Magistrate s Court recently. The six are set to appear in the Court for a formal bail application on November 22.A highly placed Zimbabwean government source yesterday confirmed to The New Age that they were aware of the developments, despite the Zimbabwean embassy, Ministry of Home Affairs and Mugabe s spokesperson professing ignorance over the matter. We re well aware of this, we have been informed about it, but obviously, we can t say much about it for security reasons. But I know our security cluster is working closely with the Hawks on the matter, the official said.A source at Witpoort police in Limpopo, where the six are detained, said preliminary reports showed several other recruits had crossed over and were already training in Mozambique. The tip-off for the arrests appears to have come a little late because we gather that another group left a few days before. The suspects have been receiving visits from the national police and we were told that this case is serious, the source said.NPA spokesperson in Limpopo Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi confirmed the suspects were facing charges relating to the contravention of immigration laws and foreign military assistance.Malabi-Dzhangi said further investigations were under way.Amnesty International Southern Africa campaigner Uyanda Mabece, said they had contacted their counterparts in Zimbabwe and the matter was receiving attention. We are still consulting with our lawyers to find a suitable date to visit the suspects. These are serious charges and we want to get the full story, he said.Peter Ramothwala and Mthokozisi Dubenews@thenewage.co.za
