Hooker Ross Ford will become only the third player to reach 100 caps for Scotland as he spearheads a new-look front row against Australia on Saturday.Ford, who made his debut against Australia 12 years ago, will join Chris Paterson (109) and Sean Lamont (105) as Scotland&#8217;s only cap centurions when Vern Cotter&#8217;s side open their autumn campaign at Murrayfield.His experience could prove vital as he will line up alongside debutant Allan Dell and Zander Fagerson, who makes his first international start.&#8220;To play 100 test matches for your country is an incredible achievement, with his lasting dedication keeping him among the best hookers in the world for a decade,&#8221; Cotter said in a statement.&#8220;He is a consummate professional and, at 32, he has plenty left to give in a Scotland jersey.&#8221;Flanker Hamish Watson and centre Huw Jones will also make their first test starts as Scotland face Australia for the first time since their heartbreaking 35-34 defeat in the World Cup quarter-final last year.That match holds painful memories for Cotter&#8217;s side, who had been on the verge of a stunning upset, before Australia snatched victory with a last-gasp penalty by Bernard Foley that many observers felt should not have been awarded.Team: 15-Stuart Hogg, 14-Sean Maitland, 13-Huw Jones, 12-Alex Dunbar, 11-Tim Visser, 10-Finn Russell, 9-Greig Laidlaw, 1-Allan Dell, 2-Ross Ford, 3-Zander Fagerson, 4-Richie Gray, 5-Jonny Gray, 6-John Barclay, 7-Hamish Watson, 8-Ryan WilsonReplacements: 16-Fraser Brown, 17-Gordon Reid, 18-Moray Low, 19-Grant Gilchrist, 20-John Hardie, 21-Ali Price, 22-Pete Horne, 23-Rory Hughes.-Reuters
