Chippa United are struggling in the league so far, but their attractive brand of football still has people talking. United s pulsating performances in recent games have seen teams struggle to contain them. But as many coaches often say, playing beautiful football without scoring goals is a futile exercise .And sadly this is fast proving to be the case for the Chilli Boys, whose fluctuating fortunes are a cause for concern for coach Dan Malesela. The Chilli Boys are on eighth spot on the log with only nine points from seven games. The Port Elizabeth outfit have a huge mountain to climb if they want to close the gap between them and log leaders Wits.Wits top the table with 16 points from six games, with two games in hand. With a limited budget, a topeight slot is a realistic ambition, but not many experts rule out a top four finish for Chippa, who achieved a top six spot last season. United skipper Thamsanqa Sangweni has admitted his side s improved performances this season have influenced opposing teams approach to their games. It seems like these teams stay at the back when they come up against us, Sangweni said. It is very difficult for us now. We are working hard. Everyone works very hard at the team. We must come up with a strategy to turn things around. We have a good coach in Malesela and he will hopefully guide us to success. news@thenewage.co.za
