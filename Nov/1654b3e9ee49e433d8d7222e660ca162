The political marriage of convenience between the EFF and the DA has been put under strain by comments by an unrepentant Julius Malema, who appeared in the Newcastle Magistrate s Court on charges of inciting land grabs yesterday.Malema warned that his party would not budge from its radical stance on land grabs. Much to the embarrassment of the DA which managed to wrest control from the ANC in three metros, Johannesburg, Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay, after the August local government polls, Malema continued with his radical rhetoric after the postponement of his case to December.Placing his party s fragile political alliance with the DA on shaky ground, Malema said: We are not calling for the slaughtering of whites, at least not for now. While the Freedom Front Plus has lambasted Malema for inciting racial hatred, the DA too was moved to condemn its erstwhile political ally. The DA strongly condemns comments made today by the leader of the EFF, Julius Malema, it said. This violent and threatening language has no place in our constitutional democracy. Malema s case was postponed to enable him to get the apartheid era Riotous Assemblies Act that had made it possible for AfriForum to lay charges against him, repealed.His counsel asked for a six month postponement to give the EFF leader time to bring a high court application to get the Riotous Assemblies Act that seeks to prevent the engendering of feelings of hostility towards other persons, declared unconstitutional but the court gave him until December to submit proof of filing a high court application to this effect, failing which he is to reappear in the court on December 7.LANGELIHLE CHAGWE &amp; CLIVE NDOU | news@thenewage.coza
