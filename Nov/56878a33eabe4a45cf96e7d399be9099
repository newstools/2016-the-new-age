KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu has condemned the conduct of a group of Durban businessmen who in recent days have been invading construction sites across the city demanding a slice of lucrative government contracts. This action reveals the extent to which has taken root in some parts of our communities. The people of this province and the country as a whole are at risk of losing their freedom and national security at the hands of unruly elements, Mchunu, who is on a visit to China, said.This was after people claiming to be representing black businesses being locked out of lucrative contracts in the city, invaded several construction sites around Durban including the R8bn residential project near Sibaya Casino.The invaders, who were previously thought to be affiliated to Durban-based Amadelangokubona Business Forum, claim to fall under a bigger federation consisting of 11 forums including the Amadelangokubona Business Forum. We have more than 60000 members who stand for radical economic transformation, the federation s spokesperson, Robert Ndlela, said.However, Mchunu described the conduct of the organisations, particularly that of the Amadelangokuna Business Forum, as damaging. This conduct of Amadelangokubona is giving KZN companies a bad name, Mchunu said.However, Ndlela denied that the organisation s members were using violence in their push for government contracts. We are professional business people who do not condone violence. Should we find that any of our members have used violence then we will definitely take steps against such a member, Ndlela said.Clive Ndou
