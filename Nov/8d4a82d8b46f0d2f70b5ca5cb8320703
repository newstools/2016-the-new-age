University protects the rapist because he&#39;s still writing exams. #rapeatjunction&mdash; Rabia Parker (@RabiaParks) November 17, 2016You know you&#39;re in varsity when management cares more about vandalism than a woman being raped #rapeatjunction&mdash; Mr Tee (@BlackBrain__) November 17, 2016Thokozani Manyange. Our manger: &quot;If u knew the details of what happend u wudnt feel unsafe&quot; Bcoz sometimes rape is safe. #RapeAtJunction pic.twitter.com/Crnfk3mF2v&mdash; Mad (@SeadimoTlale) November 16, 2016&#8220;I do not have all the details and I don&#8217;t think any of you have all the details or many of you have the details,&#8221; said Sharman in the video.According to reports, Sharman further added that &#8220;we need to be sensitive to the matter because the &#8216;alleged&#8217; rapist is writing exams.&#8221;Rape is personl to every woman. Why do we have to fight the same men that&#39;s suppose to protect us? #RapeAtJunction&mdash; tanya (@The_Tanya) November 17, 2016People need to realise that rape changes you as a person. It breaks you, leaves you cold and leaves you feeling worthless. #RapeAtJunction&mdash; Razia (@msgeorgeouss) November 17, 2016They can get court interdicts and summon police in the middle of the night yet turn a blind eye to rape #RapeAtJunction&mdash; Londeka Mtshali (@TheReal_Lozie) November 17, 2016We flirted with girls. We got drunk with girls. We made out with girls. They said no to sex, we did not rape. #RapeAtJunction.&mdash; Uncle Les (@McLegend_64) November 17, 2016I&#39;m more hurt than I am angry about #RapeAtJunction , I actually don&#39;t have the right words to express this feeling.
