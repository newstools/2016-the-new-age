Nkosana Makate s negotiations with Vodacom over the Please Call Me concept are still dragging on and there is no end in sight.The negotiations were initiated after the Constitutional Court earlier this year overturned a high court and Supreme Court of Appeal ruling that had earlier dismissed Makate s case against mobile operator Vodacom. In an interview on Monday, Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub said the negotiations were ongoing but he would only intervene if the talks fail.Vodacom spokesperson Byron Kennedy confirmed Joosub s position. Negotiations with Mr Makate to determine a reasonable compensation on the Please Call Me matter are ongoing.Vodacom is fully committed to conducting these negotiations in good faith and concluding them as soon as is practicably possible. Makate, through his lawyers, is said to be claiming R10.5bn from Vodacom in backdated liability from revenue generated by the Please Call Me service since 2000.These calculations were based on actuarial estimations by his legal team which put the figure around R70bn.The claim is 15% of the revenue received thus far and excludes interest. Makate yesterday said his team was still in talks with Vodacom. It is true what he (Joosub) said. We are still negotiating and I don t know how long it will take, he said.Makate was a trainee accountant for Vodacom in 2000 when he invented the Please Call Me concept.He shared his idea with Philip Geissler, the then head of product development, who allegedly agreed to pay him a share of the profits generated from the product if it turned out to be technically and financially viable.Makate claimed then CEO of Vodacom Alan Knott-Craig later passed off the idea as his own.SAMUEL MUNGADZE|samuelm@thenewage.co.za
