Negotiations to open the Telkom Tower to the public as a tourist attraction appear to be moving slowlyThe 269m tall tower has long been touted as an attraction that could bring great benefits to the Joburg CBD in the same way Paris benefits from the 324m Eiffel Tower.Safety concerns seem to be stalling the opening of the tower, built in 1971 and last opened to the public in 1981.Telkom executive for external communications Gugulethu Maqetuka said that despite a number of conversations with the city of Johannesburg over the past two years, they have not been able to reach an agreement to access rights and space around the base of the tower which would be required for parking and opportunities for small street traders. Telkom remains excited and keen to reopen the tower, but it will require cooperation from the city of Johannesburg, Maqetuka said.Its potential has never been in doubt with its breathtaking view of the city that is made possible by its majestic height.According to Wikipedia, it has been the tallest structure and tower in Africa for 45 years and it was also the tallest structure in the southern hemisphere until 1978, when surpassed by the 270m Mount Isa Chimney in Queensland, Australia that, unlike the Telkom tower, is a massive money spinner.It has facilities inside such as restaurants, lifts and even a nightclub that can draw large crowds. The public is able to access six public floors at the top of the tower.One of the floors houses a popular revolving restaurant named Heinrich s Restaurant, among other forms of entertainment.Telkom chief procurement officer Ian Russell said in 2015 Telkom had to ensure that the tower was safe enough to be open to the public.Russell was confident Telkom wanted the tower to be something that benefited the public and the city.Telkom has since drawn up a detailed plan to get the tower reopened as a tourist attraction but this plan needs the buy-in of the city of Johannesburg.The city and the Johannesburg Development Agency said that negotiations were still ongoing but refused to comment further.However, mayor Herman Mashaba has targeted the reopening of the tower as a vehicle that could end the lawlessness stigma associated with Hillbrow.Ponte City is another building that has been allowed to go to waste over the years.The notorious Ponte City also sits in the heart of Johannesburg. It is a skyscraper in the Berea neighbourhood, just next to Hillbrow with a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages.Ponte is now home to about 3000 middle- and working-class people including young professionals, students and different migrants such as Congolese and Nigerians.The 55-storey cylindrical building has a vigorous African beat which has international tourists in awe, but sadly it is riddled with crime. Ponte City is a tourist attraction that offers a breathtaking view of the inner city of Johannesburg.Dlala Nje is an adventures and cultural emporium at the base of Ponte City in the heart of Hillbrow that prides itself as a true taste of the inner city.Its multiracial tour guides beckon visitors: Feel the vibrancy of Africa s melting pot of culture through an unforgettable culinary experience. Community development agent Junior Mungoneni says they wanted to change people s perception of Hillbrow, known for its high levels of population density, unemployment, poverty and crime. We offer a Hillbrow tour from 11am to 3pm, which involves taking the tourists to the 51st floor of Ponte City, for a view of inner Johannesburg, Mungoneni said.He said most tourists were internationals and they wanted more South Africans to experience the tour.Barba Gaoganediwe, Gauteng Tourism spokesperson, said she wanted to be involved in talks to open the Telkom Tower and had plans to clean up the Ponte City building. GQ Magazine voted Johannesburg the coolest city in the southern hemisphere and therefore there is a need to maintain that and work on developing more landmarks, Gaoganediwe said.SISANDA MADWANTSInews@thenewage.co.za
