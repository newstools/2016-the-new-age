Bastian Schweinsteiger made a surprise return to the Manchester United bench for Sunday&#8217;s Premier League home game against West Ham United, having previously been frozen out by manager Jose Mourinho.The 32-year-old former Germany captain has not played a minute since Mourinho was appointed manager in pre-season.The Bayern Munich great was omitted from United&#8217;s Europa League squad and was also written off as an asset in the club&#8217;s financial results for the year ending June 30, 2016.But he returned to first-team training at the end of October and was named among the substitutes for West Ham&#8217;s visit in the absence of Michael Carrick, who is reported to have a muscle strain.&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to keep myself fit for the situation in which I am needed,&#8221; Schweinsteiger said earlier this month.&#8220;Hopefully I will be given a chance. I look forward to training every day and being able to train with the team. I don&#8217;t know if I will get a chance, but I hope so.&#8221;Despite his exile, Schweinsteiger has continued to attend United&#8217;s matches, regularly posting pictures of himself at Old Trafford on social media.Schweinsteiger, a key figure in Germany&#8217;s 2014 World Cup-winning team, joined United from Bayern in 2015 when Louis van Gaal was manager.-AFP
