The Tshwane University of Technology believes there is a third force causing chaos at its two Soshanguve campuses and plans to deal with all those who have vowed to destabilise the campuses.Yesterday thousands of TUT students started their final exams but there was chaos in the morning as a small group of students who did not qualify to write their final examinations caused trouble.The students threw stones and blocked roads, demanding that exams be postponed.Examinations began, however, without disruption at the Ga-Rankuwa campus while students from the Pretoria, Arts and Arcadia campuses were transported to the Tshwane Events Centre for their exams after they were moved from their campuses due to threats of disruption. Soshanguve students were also transported to the Tshwane Events Centre, although delays were experienced, following disruptions at the Soshanguve campuses at the weekend and Monday morning, TUT spokesperson Willa de Ruyter said.She said it appeared that a number of students who had been suspended were attempting to destabalise the Soshanguve campuses. Exams are continuing without interruptions at the distant campuses in eMalahleni, Mbombela and Polokwane. Security has been reinforced and the SAPS will be on standby for the duration of the examination period to ensure the safety of staff, students and property, she said.A TUT bus was torched on Sunday night on campus and the police have swept in and arrested eight suspects.TUT deputy vice-chancellor Prof Stanley Mukhola said that they were working with police to arrest those responsible for disruptions. From what we have gathered from the ground, we realised that people are funded. Some are given money to buy petrol and destroy property. As a TUT student how do you take your last cent and buy petrol? Indeed there is a third element, he said.Mukhola said that they would share all information gathered on campus with the authorities. I want to tell even those who are still out there but were involved in the arson attack, they will be arrested, he said.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
