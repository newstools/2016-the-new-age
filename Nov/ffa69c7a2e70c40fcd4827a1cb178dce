Walter Sisulu University (WSU) is looking to expedite its fight against HIV-Aids through the release of its second guide book that was developed and aimed at integrating HIV-Aids into the institutional curriculum.Centre for HIV-Aids director Nomvula Twaise, said the book would prove critical in combating the scourge of new infections, denouncing stigma and discrimination and improving the quality of life of those infected by the virus. This is the second edition following the first one which was developed and published in 2012. We have just completed revising and printing the second edition and we are now ready to distribute it throughout the university by way of workshops, Twaise said.She said that faculty representatives who took part in the revision of the guide were assigned to champion the implementation of the integration of HIV-Aids in their faculties by making sure all lecturers got the book and were trained on how to use it.The guide s development was steered by two models that were agreed upon by the institution, the integration and infusion model and the stand-alone model. The guide is not prescriptive, it s designed flexibly enough to be adopted and adapted by the university s 11 faculties. Its development was guided by the two models. Using the models and other module design criteria, the guide was awarded 16 credits which could be weaved into the programmes as the faculties see fit, Twaise said.She also stressed the importance of the endeavour as it seeks to educate, inform and as a result, capacitate students with the requisite tools to protect themselves from infection as a result of varied illiteracies about the virus.Twaise said even if education was completely successful, teaching and learning about HIV-Aids would still have to be an ongoing process as new generations of people become adults and need to know how to protect themselves from infection. The older generations, who have hopefully already been educated, may need the message reinforced and need to be kept informed, so that they are able to protect themselves and inform the youth and children, she said.Twaise said the guide would not only benefit WSU but all higher education institutions that came across it.She said already there were two universities that benefited in the first edition and higher education and training HIV-Aids programme is also planning to use this guide as an example to assist South African universities.provinces@thenewage.co.za
