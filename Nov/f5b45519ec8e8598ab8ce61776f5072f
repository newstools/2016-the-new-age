A number of Apple handsets manufactured between September and October of 2015 are eligible for replacement batteries after a fault was discovered.The battery fault causes, per TechCrunch, a &#8220;very small number&#8221; of handsets to shut down without warning, the Cupertino device designer and manufacturer announced on November 21. Apple Stores are able to check handsets against a list of serial numbers and will either replace the battery or refund the cost of a new one if the original has already been replaced by its owner.Apple noted that it had no safety concerns with the fault batteries, putting distance between itself and trouble that afflicted the launch and eventual permanent withdrawal of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 earlier in the year.-Relaxnews
