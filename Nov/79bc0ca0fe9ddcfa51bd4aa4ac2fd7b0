A year before elections, Germany&#8217;s Greens are torn by an identity crisis, split on whether joining forces with Angela Merkel&#8217;s conservatives would be a great idea or a betrayal of their ideals.Politicians in both parties have flirted with what was long an unthinkable scenario &#8212; that the chancellor&#8217;s business-friendly CDU could one day form a coalition with the left-leaning environmentalists to rule Europe&#8217;s top economy.Veteran Greens leader Winfried Kretschmann, 68, caused a stir this month when he said Merkel, who is yet to formally declare her candidacy for next September&#8217;s polls, should run for a fourth term.&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anyone who could do a better job than her,&#8221; gushed Kretschmann, the popular state premier of industrial powerhouse state Baden-Wurttemberg, who has previously said he prayed for Merkel.The party elder&#8217;s praise for Merkel sparked disquiet and embarrassment in Green ranks that is likely to flare again when their &#8220;realo&#8221; (realist) and &#8220;fundi&#8221; (fundamentalist) wings seek common ground at a party congress starting Friday.One of the Greens&#8217; co-leaders, Simone Peter, curtly shot back that &#8220;we want to end Merkel&#8217;s &#8216;grand coalition&#8217; and we certainly won&#8217;t be making any hasty determinations on who should be chancellor&#8221;.Joining the CDU is still a controversial notion but &#8220;no longer a bogeyman for the Greens&#8221;, said Lothar Probst of Bremen University, adding that Greens voters, with above-average incomes and academic qualifications, have arrived &#8220;in the middle of society&#8221;.A Spiegel magazine columnist mocked the once-radical party, saying that its ecologically mindful baby-boomers may &#8220;soon have all the progressive aura of lambskin slippers&#8221;.&#8211; Sunflowers, peace signs &#8211;Many Greens lean toward seeking a so-called &#8220;red-red-green&#8221; coalition with two other leftist parties as a chance to return them to power after over a decade on the opposition benches, with voter support now at around 12 percent.Others argue it&#8217;s best to shut up about possible future power games and focus on core policies such as ending coal power, boosting sustainable farming and scrapping a planned transatlantic trade deal.Nonetheless, the fact that a power pact with Merkel&#8217;s CDU is now thinkable speaks volumes about how both parties, and German society, have changed since the Greens first entered mainstream politics in the 1980s.When &#8220;Die Gruenen&#8221;, pioneers among Europe&#8217;s ecologist parties, were first voted into West Germany&#8217;s parliament, their long-haired MPs stunned the sombre chamber by flashing peace signs and handing out sunflowers.Born out of the 1960s and 70s pacifist and anti-nuclear protest movements, some of the youthful activist-politicians enjoyed provoking their suit-wearing elders by putting their sneaker-clad feet on the tables.The Greens underwent a radical evolution when they served in government from 1998-2005 as junior partners to the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) under chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.Ironically it was under the Greens&#8217; foreign minister Joschka Fischer, once a street protest militant, that Germany broke with its post-World War II taboo and sent troops abroad, to Kosovo and then Afghanistan.&#8211; &#8216;Stop leftist front&#8217; &#8211;Many of the Greens&#8217; once-radical ideas have become mainstream in Germany, from promoting gay rights to ending military conscription to opposing GM crops and fracking.Merkel five years ago adopted the Greens&#8217; signature policy when, after Japan&#8217;s Fukushima nuclear disaster, she decided to shutter Germany&#8217;s atomic power plants.Her open-door policy for refugees was cheered more by Greens voters than her own often sceptical CDU rank-and-file.After the 2013 election, Merkel&#8217;s victorious conservatives and the Greens held exploratory talks for a coalition, before Merkel instead opted for a grand coalition with the SPD.At the time the environment minister Peter Altmaier, now Merkel&#8217;s chief of staff, said the chances of working with the Greens had risen &#8220;from theoretical to conceivable&#8221;.Today many Greens leaders, slowly entering campaign mode, stress their differences with Merkel &#8212; though most hesitate to slam the door altogether on a future coalition.Peter said the Greens would push for &#8220;a political change in our country&#8221; and vowed that &#8220;we will deal critically with Merkel&#8217;s policies&#8221;.The Greens also see a huge stumbling block to a coalition in having to also join forces with Merkel&#8217;s arch-conservative Bavarian allies the CSU, who have railed against mass migration.That animosity goes both ways &#8212; CSU chief Horst Seehofer said last week that the declared mission of the conservatives must be to &#8220;stop the leftist front&#8221; from seizing power.-AFP
