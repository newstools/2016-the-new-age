Mamelodi Sundowns boss Patrice Motsepe will not stand in the way of Pitso Mosimane pursuing a career elsewhere. Even though Motsepe would not be drawn to speculation over the possibility of Mosimane making a return to Bafana Bafana, he said he would be amenable to the idea of the Sundowns coach leaving. The question comes in light of Shakes Mashaba s uncertain future with Bafana Bafana. Speculation is rife that Safa will pull the trigger on Mashaba, opening a vacancy for the Bafana head coach position. What s important is that as Mamelodi Sundowns, we want our players and technical staff to grow, Motsepe said. My obligation is very simple. The interests of the country are more important than my personal interest or the interests of any organisation I m associated with. But I d actually be proud if Pitso coached in Europe. I d be excited because that could also send a positive message to many young players and coaches. Whether it s a young player going overseas, or if it s Pitso or any of our coaches, they d get my blessing. Wherever there is a bigger opportunity, more money, more excitement and more growth. I don t want them to get less money or go backwards. We will do what we have always done in the past, if it were to come to that point. Motsepe emphasised the importance of planning ahead. I ll give you a bad example. If I were to be knocked down by a bus tomorrow there are people who know immediately the name of the person who is going to the new chairperson. kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za-Kgomotso Sethusha
