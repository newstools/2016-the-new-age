The official opening of the high court in Limpopo has cut short a long walk to justice for the local people who used to go to Gauteng to get high court services.The R8bn project was officially opened by Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha on Tuesday.The event was also graced by chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. A number of dignitaries also attended the official opening of the court.Masutha said the province was fortunate to be the first in the country to have a high court built under a democratic government led by the ANC.Speaking during the official opening of the High Court of South Africa Limpopo Division in Polokwane, Masutha said the project had finally materialised with a modern court building. I believe this structure is worth every cent of the R1bn invested in it.It should make the people of Limpopo proud, for it brings with it many possibilities such as the Limpopo Society of Advocates which has been established already. Many law practitioners from here who for many years have been practising in Gauteng have now come home with a wealth of experience to ensure a high quality of legal services, Masutha said.He said the new court had cut short a long walk to justice for people from Limpopo who used to have to go to Gauteng to access high court services. We have also ensured that this high court has a local seat in Thohoyandou and we are working on finalising another local seat in Lephalale. We believe that one of the drivers of development is justice, Masutha said.The minister received applause from the audience when he said work was in progress to ensure Mpumalanga also got its own high court next year.Mogoeng said the government should ensure the high court was capacitated and properly maintained to deliver quality justice to the people of the republic. Locals interviewed said they were happy there was a high court in their province. We used to go to Pretoria or Johannesburg for all cases that had to be heard in a high court. Now we will have these services in Polokwane. We will also have our own judges and advocates to attend to our cases, Paul Masemola said.montshom@thenewage.co.za
