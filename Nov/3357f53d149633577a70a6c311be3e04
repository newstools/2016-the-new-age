Renowned development coach Farouk Khan is set for a return to Kaizer Chiefs. The Stars of Africa Football Academy boss has apparently held talks with the Chiefs hierarchy and even submitted his proposal. Amakhosi supremo Kaizer Motaung is said to be keen on reviving his ailing development structures, which in the past would produce top talent for the senior team. Kaizer is serious about reviving the development structures. The chairperson has turned to Farouk because he believes he is the one guy who understands the culture of the club. There s a dossier titled The Chiefs Way, which people like Khan can contribute to immensely. The only thing holding up talks is the money, a source said.Khan did not deny the developments, but would not be entirely drawn on the matter. I m waiting on them (Chiefs). Rather talk to Chiefs, Khan said. Of course it s an opportunity I d never turn down. I have the passion for the club and the desire for development. I d love to do such work if given an opportunity.Things are not looking great with regards to the development of players in our football at the moment. But it s not my decision to make. Khan is no stranger to the Chiefs set-up. He was Ted Dumitru s right hand man when Amakhosi won the league title in 2002. When he left club football, he established the Stars of Africa Football Academy in Gauteng.The institution helped in reviving the career of Jabu Mahlangu, who went on to play for second-tier teams in Sweden after many had written him off. Khan is also credited with launching many careers in the PSL. The likes of former Chiefs midfielder Thabiso Skappie Malatsi, Bafana Bafana international and FC Dinamo Bucuresti midfielder May Mahlangu, Chiefs defender Sibusiso Khumalo, Tefu Mashamaite of SuperSport United, overseas-based duo of Andile Xaba and Ayanda Nkili and Bafana Bafana international Tokelo Rantie went through Khan s hammering and chiselling.news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
