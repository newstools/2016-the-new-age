The 10th Women s Africa Cup of Nations to be held in Cameroon later this month will afford Banyana Banyana interim coach Desiree Ellis the opportunity to impress the Safa top brass.Ellis was named as interim coach after the contract of her Dutch predecessor, Vera Pauw, was not renewed after the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in August.This tournament will set the stage for Ellis, a former prolific striker and captain of Banyana, to prove her mettle in terms of taking the team forward. The 53 year old is relishing her role and is talking tough ahead of the tournament scheduled to kick off from November 19 to December 3. We are going there to raise our hands and I thank the association for giving me the opportunity to take charge of the team, Ellis said. Now we need to show what we can do, by raising our hands as a technical team and as players. Ellis selected a strong side consisting of 21 players for the tournament and believes the squad are capable of finally winning the continental competition.The Banyana squad have five tournament debutants in goalkeeper Yolula Tsawe, defenders Astria Boks and Lebogang Mabatle, midfielder Amogelang Motau and Linda Motlhalo. We ve been runners up on four occasions. Any coach that goes to the tournament wants to win it so it s going to be tough going. Banyana play Zimbabwe tomorrow as part of their preparations.NEVILLE KHOZA |nevillek@thenewage.co.za
