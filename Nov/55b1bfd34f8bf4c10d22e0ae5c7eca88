Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson has announced the start of a period for public comment and engagement on the country s energy plans. Part of the engagement includes meetings in major cities before the end of December.Announcing this she said earlier this month the Cabinet approved the publication on the Integrated Energy Plan (IEP) and the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) for this purpose. Documents are available on the Department of Energy website and will also be published in Friday s Government Gazette.Roadshows to publicise the IEP and IRP will be held in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban between December 7 and 15. More consultations with the public are planned for January.Stakeholders such as Nedlac will also be part of the consultation process, which is due to end in February 2017. In March, the department will tweak its policy discussions and make adjustments before the final plan can be promulgatedAccording to the Department of Energy, the purpose of the IEP is to provide a roadmap of the country s future energy landscape and guide future energy infrastructure investment and policy developments.Eight key objectives were identified in the IEP. They are ensuring security of supply, minimising the cost of energy, promoting and localising job creation, minimising the negative environmental impacts, encouraging the conservation of water, diversifying the supply and primary sources of energy, endorsing energy efficiency in the economy and increasing access to modern energy.The IEP also analysed the present energy consumption trends in the agriculture, industry, residential and transport sectors.It used the results to project future energy requirements. The impact of key policies such as environmental, transport, energy efficient and industrial policies were also taken into account. The IEP then determines the optimal mix of sources and technologies to meet those energy needs in the most cost-effective manner for each of the scenarios, Joemat-Pettersson said. The IEP is therefore focused on determining the long-term energy pathway for South Africa, taking into account a multitude of factors which are embedded in the eight objectives. Of the IRP, she said a number of developments, such as additional capacity and lower demand, have emerged since the promulgation of IRP 2010-2030.The drought in neighbouring countries reduced Eskom s plant performance and changes in technology costs were other factors that have influenced the plans.The Department of Energy had four milestones, settling key assumptions, developing a base-case, modeling and analysing scenarios and sensitivities and developing the final plan.The first and second milestones have been accomplished and will form the basis of public consultations, which could lead to policy adjustments.-Dennis Cruywagen
