The Free State executive council is relieved by the court s decision to withdraw fraud, corruption and money laundering charges against sports, arts, culture and recreation MEC Mathabo Leeto.The Welkom District Court withdrew more than 200 charges against Leeto on Friday and Premier Ace Magashule said they strongly believe this is affirmation of the principle of presumed innocent until proven otherwise.The court found Leeto not guilty of more than 200 charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering and accepting bribes.The charges date back to 2007 and 2009 when she was the mayor of Matjhabeng local municipality.Leeto was arrested together with economic development MEC Dr Benny Malakoane in 2013 where they were charged alongside former Matjhabeng chief financial officer Louis de Bruin, his personal assistant Leona Nel, Oupa Molete, Hendrik Burger and two other companies.They were arrested for an irregularly awarded R13m contract to a telecommunications company.The accused allegedly received kickbacks worth R13m for irregularly awarded contracts in Matjhabeng local municipality from October 2007 to June 2008.Malakoane was the municipal manager at Matjhabeng municipality between 2007 and 2010 when the alleged crimes were committed.Magashule, who has always maintained that the two were innocent until proven guilty despite mounting pressure to sack them, said he had noted and welcomed the outcome of the court case. It takes great leadership for an elected representative, especially a member of the executive council, to humble himself/herself to the authorities. We are vindicated in our strong belief that any person is innocent until proven guilty by a court of law, Magashule said.Following the National Prosecuting Authority s decision to charge her, Leeto made representations calling for a review of the decision to chargeher. After careful consideration of evidence, no wrongdoing was established and there was no basis to continue the prosecution. Magashule further called upon all South Africans to respect the outcome of legal processes. The withdrawal of the charges against Leeto gives her an opportunity, together with the entire Free State executive council, to focus on the people s mandate to ensure radical socioeconomic transformation for the people of the Free State.
