Police in Welkom partnered with a local church at the weekend to donate groceries to those in need in the area.The police said they were not only working at protecting people and fighting crime but they are also concerned about poverty in the rural areas.Const Ntombi Monnaruri said Thabong police s social crime prevention wanted to make positive changes in the community by helping needy church members who are affected by poverty. She said the church was holding its annual Harvest Service. The theme for the service of the police and the church was make a difference in other people s lives , we initiated the project with a view to praise God while preventing crime at the same time, Monnaruri said. The church is one of the platforms that can be used to strengthen the relationship between the members of the public and the police in the fight against crime. She said they used the church to identify needy people in all areas of Thabong including those who are not church members. I personally visited some of the houses in the area and saw the difficult conditions that some of the people are faced with on a daily basis. We decided to put our resources together so that we can help wherever we can. This is just a small gesture but we hope that it will go a long way, Monnaruri said.She said they approached Sentrale Roller Meule for donations of maize meal while other community members such as Mashudu Mulaudzi assisted with groceries.In his address, Capt Neo Mokhantso from social crime prevention told the congregation that they need to work together with all stakeholders including churches. These days we find pastors involved in criminal activities and they are not reported because of their social status in communities. As a result crime continues unabated because it will put the image of the church in a bad light and we therefore need to involve churches to fight crime as it can influence the public, Mokhantso said.Reverend Wonder Mgabhazi thanked the police for assisting the needy families.Becker Semelabeckers@thenewage.co.za
