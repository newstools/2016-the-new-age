The line-up for the Nedbank Golf Challenge at Sun City has been boosted with the announcement that Martin Kaymer and Padraig Harrington will be playing in the tournament next weekend.They join an already impressive field that includes Open Champion Henrik Stenson and European teammates from the 2016 Ryder Cup, Rafa Cabrera Bello, Thomas Pieters, Andy Sullivan, Danny Willett and Chris Wood.The South African contingent includes Charl Schwartzel, Louis Oosthuizen, George Coetzee, Branden Grace and the country s Olympic duo of Jaco van Zyl and Brandon Stone.Kaymer will be targeting a second victory at the Challenge that will be hosted by the legendary Gary Player when he returns to the North West for the penultimate tournament of the European Tour s Final Series next week.The German claimed his only victory of the 2012 season at Africa s Major after memorably holing the winning putt at the Ryder Cup in Medinah earlier that year.The Golf Challenge subsequently joined the European Tour schedule in 2014 and for the first time next week it will be the final event before the Race to Dubai s finale, the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai.&nbsp;Mahlatse Mphahlele mahlatsem@thenewage.co.za
