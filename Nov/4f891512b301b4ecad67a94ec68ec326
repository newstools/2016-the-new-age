DEPUTY President Cyril Ramaphosa is to update the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) today on South Africa s efforts to develop an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection.On a day when he is scheduled to answer questions in Parliament, Ramaphosa will also give reasons for South Africa s withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC).Ramaphosa chairs the South African National Aids Council (Sanac) which is charged with the responsibility of leading the fight against HIV and Aids epidemics.The council, which includes government departments and other civil society stakeholders, has successfully driven a programme that has reduced mother to child transmission.At the moment, South Africa provides 3.4 million HIV positive people with antiretroviral treatment. The country has also launched a tuberculosis screening campaign to detect and combat TB infections.South Africa, which has informed the UN of its plans to quit the ICC, is on record as saying that the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, was incompatible with its domestic laws regarding political immunity for visiting foreign heads of state.The South African government believes its continued membership of the ICC compromised its efforts to assist in the creation of peace and security in the continent.As leader of the country s Human Resource Development Council (HRDC) tasked with the role of developing the country s human resource development strategy, Ramaphosa has visited Vietnam and Singapore to scout opportunities for South African students to study abroad.He will brief the NCOP about the HRDCs five-point plan and recommendations of the council s technical task teams (TTTs) to unlock logjams in expanding the country s skills base.Ramaphosa will also reflect on the work between the government, labour and business in efforts to continue to attract foreign direct investments to assist in growing the economy while pushing back poverty, unemployment and inequality.Ramaphosa is expected to share with the house his visit with a delegation to the World Economic Forum in Rwanda, as well as his assurance to global and regional investors that South Africa remained an attractive destination for investments and to underline that the country s institutions of democracy remained resilient.-Dennis Cruywagen
