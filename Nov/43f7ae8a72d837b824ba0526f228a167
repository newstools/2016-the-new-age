UShaka Marine World will once again echo with the sounds of African drums as more than 60 troupes perform various traditional dances associated with Zulu culture and based on warrior war dances this Sunday.The uShaka Marine World Zulu Dance Championship now in its 13th year, in association with the Department of Arts and Culture, will have the dance troupes battle it out to win one of three top spots from four entrant categories, including indlamu, ingoma and ushameni. This event is unique and only happens at uShaka Marine World. It was created to offer talented cultural performers a fantastic opportunity to develop this special art form and share it with both local and international visitors.Each performance is a memorable cultural experience that is the very heartbeat of the kingdom of the Zulu, uShaka s Brendon Meiring-Pollock said.The prize pool is R10000 for first place, R8 000 for second place and R5000 for third place. Each of the three winners will also be offered seasonal work at uShaka Marine World from December. We are very excited to be including additional Zulu traditional dance varieties this year, and more troupes that will be able to then perform in the park for the upcoming year, MeiringPollock, the events and entertainment manager, said.He said uShaka Marine World was looking forward to welcoming hundreds of dancers who will compete as well as members of the public who will definitely enjoy this dance spectacle.For more information, contact Shaun Mbatha on 031 328 8000 during office hours.NOKUTHULA NTULI
