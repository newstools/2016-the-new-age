Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Saturday met the man he calls his hero, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and unburdened his gripes about US &#8220;hypocrisy,&#8221; &#8220;bullying&#8221; and foreign wars.Duterte, who has publicly expressed his admiration for the Russian leader, said the Cold War had stood between their two countries as the Philippines, a former US colony, was historically identified with the West.But that has changed now that he is president.Since taking office in June, the foul-mouthed Duterte has upended the Philippines&#8217; historical military alliance with the United States, repeatedly saying he was shifting toward China and Russia as he embarks on an independent foreign policy.&#8220;It was good (while) it lasted,&#8221; Duterte told Putin of what he has called his &#8220;separation&#8221; from the United States.&#8220;Of late, I see a lot of these Western nations bullying small nations. And not only that, they are into so much hypocrisy,&#8221; he said during their 45-minute meeting on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the Peruvian capital Lima.&#8220;And they seem to start a war but are afraid to go to war. That is what is wrong with America and the others. They&#8217;ve been waging wars in so many places &#8212; in Vietnam, in Afghanistan and in Iraq for one single reason that there was a weapon of mass destruction, and there was none.&#8221;Duterte also said the United States &#8220;forced&#8221; the Philippines to contribute soldiers in its wars in Vietnam and Iraq.When Manila pulled out non-combat troops that were part of the US-led coalition against Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2004 following threats to behead a kidnapped Filipino worker there, Washington &#8220;made it hard for us,&#8221; Duterte told Putin in a video shot by the Philippine presidential palace broadcast team.&#8220;These are the things I see which is not a good idea,&#8221; Duterte said in English.He also said the Philippines longed to be part of Europe.&#8220;We&#8217;ve been longing to be part also of &#8212; despite the distance &#8212; we have been longing to be part of Europe, especially in commerce and trade around the world.&#8221;&#8211; Guns, women and Putin &#8211;Duterte, who has cultivated an image as a no-nonsense leader, said last month that &#8220;my favorite hero is Putin.&#8221;He has also said that he and Putin seem to share a passion for guns and women.Favorite targets for his abusive verbal tirades are US President Barack Obama, UN chief Ban Ki-moon and the European Union.All three have expressed concern over Duterte&#8217;s iron-fisted policy against drugs, which they said violated human rights and due process.Duterte missed the gala dinner at the APEC summit Saturday evening, sending a message to the hosts that he was sick.Staying put in his hotel may have avoided a potentially awkward encounter with Obama, who cancelled a meeting with him at another summit in September after Duterte called him a &#8220;son of a whore.&#8221;-AFP
