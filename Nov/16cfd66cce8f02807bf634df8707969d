As less rainfall fell in the province in recent days failing to replenish natural grazing fields, the provincial department of agriculture continued to issue drought-relief packages to farmers.The department has now established a total of 67 sites in the five districts to deliver fodder for cattle farmers to help feed their animals. Most of these delivery sites in rural areas are located at traditional leaders places that are accessible to local farmers. We also drill boreholes to provide drinking water to livestock and up to now 60 boreholes are complete. A total of R17m was spent on boreholes, department spokesperson Selby Makgotho said. The department is presently processing 156 applications for boreholes. The drought is very severe, only good rains can break it, Makgotho said.Commercial farmers union, AgriSA, has also come to the stage by distributing fodder to small farmers in rural areas around Marble Hall.Crop farmers have also failed to plough on time because of insufficient soil moisture levels.Farmer Jack Mathibela who farms near Groblersdal said: I delay planting my crops until decent rains come. And if soaking raindrops do not come it will be a blow to my farming enterprise Mathibela said.The drought that is ravaging the province has also forced some farmers to sell their livestock cheaply while commercial farmers are shedding jobs or hiring fewer seasonal workers.MONTSHO MATLALA montshom@thenewage.co.za
