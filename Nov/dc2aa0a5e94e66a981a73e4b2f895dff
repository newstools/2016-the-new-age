Twenty three people have been injured and several critical after a taxi rolled several times on the R54 in Vaal Marine, south of Johannesburg on Thursday. On arrival to the scene paramedics found that twenty three people were injured while there were several people critical. In a statement by ER24, &#8220;paramedics along with different services arrived on the scene and found the taxi laying some distance away from the road&#8221;. &#8220;Most of the occupants from the taxi were found laying next to the roadside&#8221; said Russel Meiring ER24 spokesperson. The paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured ones with advanced life support. The patients were later transported to Sebokeng and Kopanong Hospital for further treatment. &#8220;It is believed that the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing it to roll multiple times and eject some of its occupants&#8221;, said Meiring. The cause of the collision is not known at this stage and police are investigating.-TNA Reporter
