Fees Must Fall leader and Wits University student Mcebo Dlamini s R55000 a year state bursary could be revoked if he is convicted of the five charges brought against him during the fees protests.Dlamini was arrested in October and charged with theft, public violence, possession of dangerous weapons, assault and contravening a court order.He was later released on a R2000 bail and his trial is set to begin in June next year, but Dlamini has indicated through his lawyers that he has written to the National Prosecuting Authority to have the charges dropped.The Gauteng government is funding Dlamini s bachelor of law degree at Wits University. Mcebo was awarded a discretionary bursary of R55000 for tuition fees and prescribed books in 2016, Gauteng education department acting spokesperson Oupa Bodibe, said.He said that the contract between government and Dlamini, said the state could terminate the bursary contract and demand a repayment of the amounts paid. The Gauteng City Region Academy (GCRA) is entitled to terminate the bursary contract if the bursar ceases to pursue or fails the particular year of study if the GCRA, in its sole and absolute discretion, is not satisfied with the bursar s examination results or with any report from the learning institution relating to the bursar s academic results or conduct in general, he said.Bodibe said that the bursary could also be taken away if the benefactor is convicted of a criminal offence or misconducts himself or herself in such a manner as to warrant the termination of the bursary contact, or is found guilty of misconduct by the learning institution or move to be a permanent resident of another province during the period of study. In general, GCRA retains the right to terminate this contract at any time should circumstances warrant such termination and to further recover any amounts paid in terms of this contract, Bodibe said.Meanwhile, Wits students who wish to write final examinations in the second sitting in December and January have until Friday to apply and secure a space for the second sitting.The decision by Wits to implement a second sitting comes after Dlamini was released from prison and mobilised students to demand the additional sitting. Students who are unable to write their examination due to illness or for other reasons should submit their applications for the second sitting within the three-day period following the examination, Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel said. Those who have already applied for deferred examinations will automatically be allowed to participate in the second sitting in December-January, depending on the faculty.
