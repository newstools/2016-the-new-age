Regulatory framework, change in human behaviour, surveillance and data are just some of the things needed in what was yesterday described as a call to arms in the war against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) also sometimes referred to as superbugs.Speaking during a conference on AMR hosted by the Department of Health and its UK counterpart, director-general of health Precious Matsoso said surveillance and diagnostic technologies were crucial in curbing the spread of superbugs.The World Health Organisation said while antibiotic resistance occurs naturally, misuse in humans and animals is accelerating the process.The health body has warned that new resistance mechanisms are emerging and spreading globally threatening the treatment of infectious diseases which results in prolonged illness, disability and deaths.Matsoso said human behaviour was largely responsible for the spread of super bugs and urgent action was needed.A recent survey by the WHO found that public perceptions on antibiotic use in SA was reasonable when compared with other countries, something Matsoso said was encouraging.It is estimated that at least 700000 people die every year due to drug resistant illnesses globally.This week marks World Antibiotic Awareness Week.-LERATO DIALE
