Despite Marius Fransman s appeal against his five-year suspension, the ANC in the Western Cape has given its strongest signal yet that it wants to move on without him.Today the leadership of the party in the Western Cape will give its official reaction to the five-year suspension meted out to Fransman by the ANC national disciplinary committee (NDC).In a statement the ANC said it would brief the media today about the sanctions imposed by the NDC as well as on the next step .According to the statement, officials will outline in detail the implications of the committee s outcomes for the organisation, provincial executive committee and office bearers .Ominously for Fransman, the statement said: The officials will discuss the ANC constitutional imperatives of the outcomes and the necessary readjusting the organisation must do to ensure smooth continuity in the affairs of the organisation. Earlier this month Fransman was suspended for five years after the NDC ruled against him when it considered allegations of sexual harassment made by Louisa Wynand.The committee found that Fransman abused his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Wynand and had made public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute.Fransman is on record as questioning what he called a flawed process.He has said that he will appeal the decision and has been quoted as saying: They will apologise for their injustice and for the disrespectful manner in which they have treated me. I am appealing the decision and engaged in other processes to clear my name, which they set out to destroy. It is understood that he has begun appeal proceedings.The New Age reported last week that Fransman blamed his exposing of a plot to oust President Jacob Zuma for his disciplinary woes.At the time, Fransman told The New Age that he was planning to appeal his five-year suspension imposed by the ANC s disciplinary committee after being found guilty of sexual harassment.He said the decision against him was a predetermined one, adding that the integrity commission report, which had recommended he be tried at a disciplinary hearing, was not even used.Fransman said he had raised the planned coup against President Zuma at a meeting of the national executive committee in September 2015. I said we had uncovered that a group of people in the Western Cape, supported by money from Johannesburg, was saying that President Zuma must be removed at the national general council meeting scheduled for October 2015, Fransman said.Dennis Cruywagennews@thenewage.co.za
