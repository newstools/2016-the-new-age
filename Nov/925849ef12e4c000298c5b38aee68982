Efforts by the South African Police Service to block the flow of illicit drugs into KwaZulu Natal by cutting off the international drug syndicates supply lines at King Shaka International Airport and at Durban harbour are beginning to pay dividends following major busts in recent months.In Durban, several suspects nabbed in intelligence-driven operations by members of the Hawks are on trial in various courts across the city after attempting to smuggle drugs into the province.Recent breakthroughs by the Hawks include the recent arrest of a 37-year-old suspect arrested after investigators, in collaboration with customs officials, intercepted a vessel in Durban harbour transporting a container with 140kg of ephedrine used in the manufacture of crystal methamphetamine.The drugs whose street value is estimated at about R15m, were hidden in cargo shipments containing food imports.In another blow to the drug syndicates, a 28 year old is on trial in the Verulam Magistrate s Court following his attempt to smuggle in R500 000 worth of cocaine through King Shaka after boarding a flight from S o Paulo in Brazil, via Dubai, to Durban.The prevalence of drugs in the province was this year highlighted by the death of six pupils four in KwaMashu, north of Durban, and two in Pietermaritzburg, after they had consumed drugs known as Mercedes a stronger version of the drug ecstasy.National Hawks head Gen Berning Ntlemeza recently embarked on a road show in the province in which he urged the public to participate in the elite unit s campaign against drugs by blowing the whistle on drug dealers and smugglers.The recent arrests, Ntlemeza said, were part of a coordinated campaign by the Hawks aimed of creating a drugfree society. The world would be a better place if we didn t have to worry about the scourge of drugs. The solution to a drug-free world is the closure of all routes of drug dealers and addressing the cause of the illicit trade lies with all of us here, he said. We are all worried about the illegal drugs that have taken over the lives of our people. We have one aim, to achieve a drug-free society, he said.He hailed the recent anti-drug cooperative agreement between SA and Russia as important in the war against drugs.CLIVE NDOU
