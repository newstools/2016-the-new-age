After the recent fees must fall protests across the country, 15 students will embark on a 1000 km walk on Thursday to raise funds to assist students who cannot afford tuition fees.Founder of the Feet4Fees movement Reuben Oosthuysen and a third year Bachelor of Arts student at Wits University said the initiative was prompted by the current crisis in tertiary education in South Africa.&#8220;I have seen too many students struggling on a daily basis with financial stress, and good students not being able to return for the next year of study due to a lack of funding. Feet4Fees hopes to show South Africans that we can all make a difference,&#8221; said Reuben.With the Department of Higher education facing challenging times and student funding at the centre of student protests, Feet4Fees Campaign will seek to help to raise fund for those students in need at Wits University.Reuben also mentioned the values of Madiba and a pilgrimage in Europe further spurred him into action. When I heard about the Camino De Santiago pilgrimage in Europe, my interest quickly transformed into rather doing such a pilgrimage in South Africa, with education funding as the cause. This walk will also honour Madiba, who had a sincere passion for education and undertook his long walk to freedom and subsequently freed all of us, said Oosthuysen.Feet4Fees Ambassadors will see students attempt to walk from Wits University to Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) in Port Elizabeth.&#8220;I felt compelled to act when I witnessed the daily plight of my peers, some of whom were sleeping under desks in empty tutorial venues or libraries,&#8221; said Oosthuysen.The project aims to raise R1000 for each kilometre the ambassadors cover with donations from private individuals and corporate sponsors. This translates to a minimum of R1 000 000.The walkers will also undertake other activities en route to their destination. This includes stopping at a number of schools in order to create awareness on study options and various sources of financial aid.The learners will also be introduced to online platforms for school subject tutoring.All funds raised will be managed by a national bursary administration organisation, StudyTrust. The current and future bursary students of South Africa are set to benefit from the funds raised.Individuals and corporate are encouraged to donate towards student bursaries and education as a whole, in any way they can.&#8220;We have a donation portal on our website www.feet4fees.co.za for anyone that would like to contribute directly towards the cause. Feet4Fees also hopes to inspire South Africans to take the initiative and realise this nation&#8217;s full potential,&#8221; said OosthuysenThe walk begins on Thursday December 1 at Great Hall Piazza, Braamfontein Campus East, Wits University and participants aim to arrive in Port Elizabeth on 20 December 2016.TNA Reporter
