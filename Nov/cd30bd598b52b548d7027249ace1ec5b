This tournament, however, will provide a much tougher test for our team, which is exactly what we need to measure where we are in terms of our standards. The girls were disappointed that we did not meet the standards to participate in the Olympic Games this year, but personally he felt that they were not in the right space to compete on that level from a skills and conditioning perspective , Dazel said.Lehlohonolo Mashigo&nbsp;&nbsp;
