Orlando Pirates must stop relying only on striker Tendai Ndoro for goals. This is an appeal from caretaker coach Augusto Palacios to his players following their 1-0 Telkom Knockout semifinal defeat to SuperSport United on Saturday.The Buccaneers have been relying solely on Ndoro for goals this season, with the striker netting nine of the 10 goals that the club have scored in the Absa Premiership. The other goal was scored by new striker Thabiso Kutumela. Luvuyo Memela, Mpho Makola and Oupa Manyisa are the other players who have contributed goals to the Soweto giants in cup competitions such as MTN 8 and Telkom Knockout this season. Ndoro, who is the league leading goal scorer, has been the only consistent goal scorer for Pirates. It even seems like the Sea Robbers cannot score if the Zimbabwean fails to rattle the back of the net.Speaking after his side were knocked out of the Telkom Knockout competition by SuperSport, Palacios challenged his other attackers to start contributing goals. You saw Thabo Qalinge. He came on and he was completely positive, Palacios said. He had two clear chances to score and Reyaad Pieterse made two great saves. Memela also had a great chance although you are correct when you say if Ndoro is not scoring then we are not scoring. The ball arrived for him to score. Unfortunately he could not score. We will continue to work on this. Mpho Makola used to score but I believe that it was not our day. We just could not convert the chances we created. While the Soweto team is struggling to get goals, strikers such Ayanda Nkosi, Sello Japhta and Kutumela are sitting on the bench and at times on the stands with very limited game time. The former African Champions have been playing a 4-5-1 system which has been allowing Ndoro to play as a lone striker assisted by Makola. Meanwhile, Bucs will have to regroup as they face tricky Baroka FC in the league match on Wednesday at the Peter Mokaba Stadium.nevillek@thenewage. co.za-Neville Khoza
