The University of Johannesburg (UJ) has honoured 299 employees who reached their long-service milestone anniversaries in 2016.Vice-chancellor Prof Ihron Rensburg, Prof Angina Parekh, Prof Kinta Burger and Prof Letlhokwa George Mpedi were part of those awarded for serving the institution between 10 and 45 years. The university owes its ongoing success to the commitment and dedication of its employees. This is an opportunity to recognise the hope, resilience and determination that have been shown over the years and to celebrate you, our long-serving employees, for your efforts to help build the legacy of our university, Rensburg said.At the 2016 long service awards ceremony last week, Prof Dirk Daniel van Reenen was recognised as the longest serving employee with 45 years of service. He was followed by Prof Jean Christoph Sonnekus and Mr Philemon Aphane both from the law faculty who were honoured for their 40 years of service.Reflecting on his UJ journey, Van Reenen said: My academic journey started on February 1, 1971 when I was appointed as a lecturer in the Department of Geology at the former Rand Afrikaans University.At that time, the department consisted of only four academic staff members but has since grown to be one of the two largest geology departments in South Africa comprising 23 academic staff members, he said.He said that his long academic journey provided him with the opportunity to collaborate and travel internationally. Exposure to researchers from many different cultures, locally and abroad, not only broadened my horizons, but also those of my family.I am fortunate to be still associated with the institution at the time when this institution is functioning at strength.-Kutullo Madisha
