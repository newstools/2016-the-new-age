Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane laid criminal charges against President Jacob Zuma at the Rosebank Police Station in Johannesburg on Tuesday.Mmusi Maimane says the party intends to ensure President Jacob Zuma, and those implicated by State Capture report are held accountable for their abuse of power to make themselves rich.Maimane made the remarks outside the Rosebank Police Station after laying criminal charges against President Jacob Zuma.The DA leader said that the state capture report released by the Public Protector points to a prima facie criminal case against Zuma which should be investigated.&#8221; The police must now launch an investigation into these criminal charges without delay, we will be closely monitoring the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to ensure that it does its job and President Zuma &amp; Co are fully prosecuted.&#8221; said Maimane&#8220;These are serious charges and we cannot exempt anyone because of the political office they hold. According to Maimane the DA has requested the police to investigate possible wrongdoing by the board members of Eskom, Mosebenzi Zwane, Salim Essa, Linda Mabaso, Malcolm Mabaso, Eric Wood, Kamal Singhala, Johannes Motseki, Pushpaveni Govender, Des van Rooyen and Duduzane Zuma.The DA also said it would be laying charges against former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe in terms of the PFMA and Prevention and Combatting of Corruption Act.The charges by the DA come after the party&#8217;s motion of no confidence, failed when the ANC s parliamentary caucus united to overwhelmingly defeat the motion by 214 votes to 126.The DA called for the motion to be debated following the release of the State Capture report however ANC MP and Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba in Parliament called the motion, the fifth since 2014, frivolous and farcical, accusing the DA of acting by stealth.The ANC would not aid the DA in the denigration of President Zuma and the ANC, said Gigaba.&#8211;TNA Reporter
