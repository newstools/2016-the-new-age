Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Siyabonga Mpontshane says he has achieved most of his goals as a footballer but he is short of Bafana Bafana caps to complete his career targets.The 30 year old has won two trophies but if he was to retire without representing Bafana it would mean he has failed to fulfil all his goals.Mpontshane was part of the Bafana squad that played Sudan and Nigeria in the 2015 African Cup of Nations qualifiers.But at the moment, it looks like his goal to jostle for a starting place with Itumeleng Khune at Bafana is unlikely.Mpontshane is struggling to get game time at the Sea Robbers and is yet to play this season.Since joining the Soweto giants last year, the 30-year-old Mpontshane has not been able to establish himself as the first-choice goalkeeper.He is competing for a starting berth with Brighton Mhlongo, Jackson Mabokgwane and Felipe Ovono of Equatorial Guinea.Before joining Pirates, Mpontshane helped his former club, Platinum Stars, to win the MTN 8 and Telkom Knockout competitions three years ago.He attended the Telkom Knockout Connected Youth initiative in Garankuwa on Thursday. I think I have achieved what I wanted when I came into the game, Mpontshane said. To win two cup competitions in one season is huge. I believe that is a big achievement for any player. That is what I wanted and I am happy to have managed to achieve it. But there is one goal that I haven t achieved yet which is to play for Bafana Bafana. I have received a call up before but I want to play for the national team. The Gwavuma-born goalie understands it will take more than a wish to achieve his goal.He will have to work hard to beat his competitors at Pirates to get the attention of the national team selectors.Mpontshane sat on the bench for the first time this season and watched his side defeat Free State Stars 1-0 at Orlando Stadium on Saturday.
