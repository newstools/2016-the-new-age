State witness Luthando Siyoni is expected to take the stand in the murder and abduction trial of businessman Christopher Panayiotou on Thursday.Siyoni made a brief appearance at the Port Elizabeth magistrate court on Wednesday.The state alleges that the plan to kill Jayde Panayiotou started as early as 2014 and the recruitment of hit-men happened on Facebook.Jayde disappeared from her home in Port Elizabeth in April last year. Her body was found a day later in an open field in KwaNobuhle township.Siyoni&#8217;s appearance was long awaited as he is a Section 204 state witness. The admissibility of his evidence will be argued as he was apparently assaulted. Siyoni was warned to be back in the dock this morning when the trial resumes.At the time of Jayde&#8217;s disappearance, Siyoni was a bouncer at Panayiotou&#8217;s nightclub and was arrested as a middle man who allegedly paid other suspects to abduct and kill his employer&#8217;s wife.Christopher Panayiotou is accused of being the mastermind behind his wife Jayde s kidnapping and murder, this according to information given to the police by alleged accomplice turned state witness Luthando Siyoni.Meanwhile the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said it still has a strong case against all accused despite the death of the man who pulled the trigger.Alleged hitman Sizwe Vumazonke died in hospital after falling into a coma last week, but the NPA says it is in the dark as to the cause of his death.NPA spokesperson Tsepo Ndwalaza stated that Vumazonke&#8217;s death has not changed anything. You must remember that Vumazonke was the last to be arrested. It was even after the arrest of Christopher Panayiotou. His death will not affect the trial process at all. The other accused are alive and they will go to trial as planned, Ndwalaza said.-TNA Reporter
