Frank de Boer has been sacked as coach of Inter Milan after the Serie A giants slipped to 13 points off the pace in Italy’s top flight. “Inter Milan announces that Frank de Boer has been relieved of his duties as first-team coach,” said a club statement. “The first-team squad will be taken over provisionally by our youth team coach, Stefano Vecchi, who will be on the bench for the Europa League game against Southampton. “The club would like to thank Frank and his staff for their contribution and wish them all the best for the future.” –AFP
