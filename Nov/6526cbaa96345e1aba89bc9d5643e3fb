Father Charbel Issu stands before a shattered altar, spreads out his hands and begins leading a group of Kalashnikov-wielding militia fighters in prayer.&#8220;Our father who art in heaven,&#8221; they chant.&#8220;Hallowed be thy name.&#8221; On the wall in front of them, graffiti scrawled in black spray paint reads &#8220;Allahu Akbar (God is the greatest)&#8221;.Iraqi fighters battling to oust the Islamic State group from Mosul recaptured the Catholic Mar Behnam monastery onSunday, allowing its priests to return.Dating back to the fourth century AD, the Syriac Catholic monastery lies just 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of Iraq&#8217;s second city which became a bastion of the jihadist group after it swept across northern Iraq in 2014.When they seized it in 2014, the jihadists sacked the monastery, smashing carvings off the wall, decapitating a statue of the Virgin Mary and leaving the building as an empty shell.The priests fled and most have not returned. &#8220;I am both happy and sad,&#8221; Issu, a former director of the monastery, told AFP on his first visit back.&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to return to these holy places, to see this monastery where I spent a year and a half as superior.&#8220;At the same time, I&#8217;m sad to see it like this, in such bad condition, demolished. It hurts my heart,&#8221; he said. In front of the main building, he peered down on the rubble covering the tombs of Mar Behnam &#8212; a Syriac saint from whom the monastery gets its name &#8212; and his sister Sara.In 2015, IS jihadists posted a video of themselves blowing up the tomb. Today, little remains.It was part of an IS campaign of destruction as it swept across the region.The jihadists trashed other faiths&#8217; places of worship and blew up ancient sites such as the Assyrian city of Nimrud and the Greco-Roman remains of Palmyra in neighbouring Syria .-AFP
