Many pregnant women and girls are still not getting antenatal care during their pregnancy despite the danger of complications and death with most only presenting at clinics at a late stage in their pregnancy due to a number of factors.This has led to the World Health Organisation (WHO) releasing new guidelines on quality antenatal care in a bid to curb the risk of still births and pregnancy complications.In 2014 Amnesty International released a report detailing how many South African women and girls do not go for antenatal care at local clinics until late in their pregnancy as they fear that their HIV status might be released.Lack of information about sexual and reproductive health and transport issues, especially in rural areas, are among the reasons for pregnant women not going for healthcare services.Other factors include cultural beliefs, and bad treatment by healthcare workers among others.Rethabile Ndlovu, a 25-year-old mother from Ekurhuleni blamed the unprofessional behaviour of healthcare workers. The first time I went to the clinic I was treated like a criminal by nurses for being pregnant so I vowed not to return there until I give birth. I just rebelled. Funny enough I gave birth at Natalspruit hospital and I was treated with dignity, she said.Figures by WHO show that 303 000 women died from pregnancy related causes while 2.7 million babies died during the first 28 days of life and 2.6 million babies were stillborn worldwide in 2015.Figures also show that globally only 64% of women receive antenatal care four or more times throughout pregnancy.According to Statistic SA s recently released Recorded Live Births/Perinatal Deaths report show a perinatal death decline of 3.6% from 2013 while in 2014 about two thirds (65.8%)of perinatal deaths were still births and one third (34.2%) were early neonatal deaths.The report also showed that estimated morality rates ranged from 6.2 early neonatal deaths per 1000 live births 11,8 stillbirths per 1000 total births to a national perinatal rate of 17,9 perinatal deaths per 1000 total births. Almost all perinatal deaths are preventable if a woman receives quality care which includes four or more antenatal care visits, delivers in a healthcare facility, attended by a skilled birth attendant and how she delivers, the report states.The WHO recommends a minimum of eight visits for antenatal care, saying it can reduce perinatal deaths by up to 8 per 1000 births when compared to four visits. According to the recommendation pregnant women should have their first visit at 12 weeks gestation with subsequent visits taking place at 20, 26, 30, 34, 36, 38 and 40 weeks.Lerato Dialeleratod@thenewage.co.za
