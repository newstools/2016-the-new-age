The Marikana massacre widows and family members have been asked to provide proof that they suffered emotional shock, trauma and grief before they can be compensated.It has been almost a year since the government agreed on an out of court settlement to avoid a lengthy court process, but so far no payments and instead, the families of the deceased are being examined by specialists.Socio-Economic Rights Institute s Nomzamo Zondo, representing the families, said they had laid various claims for compensation including that of emotional shock, trauma, loss of support, an apology from the government and more.She said there had been progress in the negotiations for claims relating to loss of support. We ve been asked to provide proof of emotional shock and trauma. The process of our clients seeing specialists has started. Thereafter, we have to produce reports from the specialists detailing the levels of trauma and suffering by our clients, Zondo said.Two lawsuits, one by the injured miners amounting to more than R1bn and another by the widows of the miners who were shot dead by the police, were launched against the state soon after the Marikana Commission of Inquiry was concluded.In December 2015, President Jacob Zuma announced that the government was committed to seeking an expedited resolution of legitimate legal claims instituted as a consequence of the Marikana Massacre.Although, Zondo said there has been communication between them and the state on the issue. The lawyer representing the miners Andries Nkome, said his clients are in limbo about what is happening. My clients are living in dire constraints. We have heard no communication from the government, Nkome said.Seventeen of Nkome s clients are due to appear in court in February next year on charges of murder of the 10 people who died before August 16, 2012, when 33 miners were shot dead by the police.When announcing the decision to settle the lawsuits out of court, the government clearly stated that the 17 miners were not included.Presidential spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga said that by March 2016, the government had conceded 100% merits of legitimate legal claims. Instructions were given to settle claims including claims of unlawful arrest and detention but the state will exclude those claims that are under criminal investigation and those that face possible prosecution. Attorneys for claimants were urged to provide all information required for the settlement process, he said.With regard to personal injury claims, the government proposed that both parties use one set of medical experts to assist in quantifying these claims to reduce costs and to expedite the process of calculation and settlement.Ngqulunga said the calculation of personal injury claims can only commence once the state and the plaintiff attorneys agree on the set of experts to calculate the quantum of these claims.The 10 people include six miners who were not part of the strike, two police officers who were hacked to death by miners and two Lonmin Mine security guards who were hacked and burnt to death.After two years of proceedings, the commission s judge Ian Farlam found that the striking miners promoted a confrontational condition that lead to deaths of Lomnin security guards and the non-striking workers. And endangered lives of non-striking workers. The taking up of arms and the use of violence by the strikers was an important contributory fact to the situation at Marikana developing as it did. It alerted the police to the type of criminal acts they were required to deal with and precipitated a police presence in addition to public order policing. It was also an indication of the lengths to which the strikers were prepared to go to enforce their demands, Farlam said in the report.The 17 miners had submitted representations to the director of public prosecutions calling for charges against them to be dropped late last year.The NPA was expected to present its response in court in Rustenburg early this month, but instead it requested a postponement.Nkome said he believed they had made a strong case on why the charges should be withdrawn.Dudu Dubedudud@thenewage.co.za
