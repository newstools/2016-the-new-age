The annual Off the Lip Movember Surf Jam is back as Tongaat Beach Bums and surfing stars including Durban s Beyrick de Vries and defending champion Brandon Jackson will be joining the action in support for the men s health movement, Movember.The event tomorrow is in support of Movember a campaign by the Men s Foundation where men commit to growing and grooming their moustaches during November then take part in events such as the Off The Lip Movember Surf Jam to raise funds and awareness of men s health issues. The moustache is our ribbon for men s health. As the pink ribbon is to breast cancer, our moustache is our ribbon. Use it to raise awareness and funds and stop men dying too young, Garron Gsell, chief executive and founder of the Men s Foundation which drives Movember in SA, said.Father of Olympian Chad le Clos, Bert le Clos may be the father of one of the world s fastest swimmers, but he is the first to admit that making big health decisions of his own can take much longer than they should .It was two and a half years ago that Le Clos was first diagnosed with prostate cancer but did nothing about it. I was in denial, I didn t want to think about it. I didn t want to be exposed to the treatment, the Movember ambassador said. Then, earlier this year, his wife Geraldine was diagnosed with cancer and had to have a double mastectomy. It was a wake-up call for me. The oncologist told me if I stayed in denial, the cancer would move out of my prostate and it would kill me, he said.NOKUTHULA NTULI
