The fuel price outlook for next month is pointing to a reduction in the petrol price of 45c/litre and a 38c/litre for diesel.Paraffin users will enjoy a 40c/litre reduction in illuminating paraffin, data released by the Central Energy Fund (CEF) said yesterday.But this relief is likely to be dampened by the weak rand, which lost about 4% after the US presidential elections two weeks ago. Although the currency recovered from the Donald Trump surprise, the latest talk that US interest rate hikes are imminent next month has already pushed the local currency into a tailspin.From a trade of R13.33/$ at the beginning of this month, the local currency is now trading above R14/$. Although the rand recovered somewhat yesterday, trading at R14.21/$, it is difficult to predict how far it can go as investors are shifting money from emerging markets into the US for better yields.The Automobile Association (AA), which was commenting on unaudited mid-month fuel price data released by the CEF, said fuel price relief could be on the horizon for South Africans after international petroleum prices came off their late-October highs. International oil prices remained stable throughout October, but have been in decline since the beginning of this month, the AA said. The rand /US dollar exchange rate firmed over the same period, making a welcome contribution to the picture. The latest data suggests a reduction in the petrol price of 45c/litre, with diesel down by 38c/litre and illuminating paraffin by a 40c/litre reduction, the AA said.However, the AA also said the rand had weakened sharply against the dollar in the wake of the US election results and that if the local currency did not return to its previous levels, the fuel price picture could be quite different by the end of the month.At the beginning of the month, the petrol price increased by a similar margin while diesel shot up by 63c/litre.BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@thenewage.co.za
