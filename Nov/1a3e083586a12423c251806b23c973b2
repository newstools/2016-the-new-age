Japanese fifth seed Kei Nishikori claimed his 300th career win on Wednesday, beating Serbia&#8217;s Viktor Troicki 6-2, 7-5 to reach the last 16 of the Paris Masters.Nishikori, who is set to make his third appearance at the end-of-season Tour finals this month, reeled off five games in succession to take the opening set.The former US Open finalist twice dropped serve early in the second set but earned a crucial break at five-all to set up a potential showdown with home favourite Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the next round.&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking, you know, about 500 or 1000 wins,&#8221; said Nishikori, who missed out on the milestone Sunday after he lost to Marin Cilic in the Basel final.&#8220;I think this year has been pretty good. I have been winning a lot of matches and playing a lot of tournaments.&#8220;Every year I feel like I&#8217;m getting strong so I&#8217;m happy with my performance right now.&#8221;Nishikori, 26, also finished runner-up to Novak Djokovic at both the Miami Masters and Toronto Masters earlier this year.Belgium&#8217;s David Goffin remained in contention for a London berth after he defeated Frenchman Nicolas Mahut 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 in round two.The eighth seed currently trails Dominic Thiem, Cilic and Tomas Berdych in the race for the final two places in London.&#8211;AFP
