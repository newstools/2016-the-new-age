President Barack Obama offered assurances Sunday to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of &#8220;enduring US commitment&#8221; to close ally Tokyo after Donald Trump&#8217;s shock election victory, an official said.Trump had alarmed Tokyo policymakers during his campaign for this month&#8217;s presidential election by musing about pulling thousands of US troops from the region and suggesting that officially pacifist Japan may need nuclear weapons.However, Abe sounded a positive note after last week becoming the first foreign leader to meet Trump, saying that the US president-elect was someone in whom he could have &#8220;great confidence.&#8221;Obama sought to reassure Japan of America&#8217;s commitment to its close alliance with Tokyo in brief talks with Abe on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on Sunday, a White House official said.&#8220;The president reaffirmed the enduring US commitment to Japan, our treaty ally, and expressed his gratitude for their years of successful cooperation that further strengthened the US-Japan alliance,&#8221; said the official.Trump, who is due to be inaugurated as president in January, also vowed during the election to tear up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed vast trade pact backed by Obama and which Abe has made a top priority.-AFP
