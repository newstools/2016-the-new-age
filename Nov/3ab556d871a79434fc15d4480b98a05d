THE social media have had mixed reactions to the sudden resignation of Idols SA judge Gareth Cliff who tendered his resignation from the popular television show yesterday.Many of his fickle fans on social media wasted no time with their own suggestions for his successor, with such names as Idols SA vocal coach RJ Benjamin, pop singer Danny K, dance crooner Zakes Bantwini and Afrikaans rapper Jack Parrow being bandied about. However, speaking to The New Age, Mzansi Magic publicist Nondumiso Macebe said the channel still had to think about a replacement as Cliff s resignation had come as a surprise. A decision about Gareth Cliff s replacement has not yet been made. We will make it known to the media as soon as we reach a decision, Macebe said. Cliff, who recently returned from New York with the Idols SA top four finalists, said the trip was a good way to bring this chapter to a close . Cliff said: Why stay on the show when you have run your course? &nbsp;
