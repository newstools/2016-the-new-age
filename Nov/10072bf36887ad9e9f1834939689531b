Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies on Monday said South Africans need to shift the burden of responsibility to the liquor industry, in relation to alcohol abuse and not solely rely on civil society.&#8220;The attitude from industry seems to want to continue with the status quo and not change anything but that is not working,&#8221; said Davies.The Minister was speaking during the opening of the Liquor Amendment Bill Indaba hosted in Kempton Park east of Johannesburg to discuss recommendations made by stakeholders in relation to proposed amendments of the liquor bill.Davies decried the state of alcohol consumption in the country saying it was higher than most other parts of the globe.&#8220;Looking at the world average liquor consumption per capita, South Africa stands at about twice the average. We consume about twice as much as the world average of liquor in this country. That liquor consumption goes along with serious alcohol abuse,&#8221; said Davies.According to Davies, South African tax payers fork out close to R37.9bn per annum in order to deal with the effects of alcohol abuse.&#8220;When we look at the admissions to casualty wards, we look at unnatural deaths, something like half of the people who are dying unnaturally in South Africa from road accidents or violent crimes have blood alcohol levels that are greater than the level that is legal to drive,&#8221; said Davies.The proposed amendments to the Liquor Amendment Bill include raising the legal drinking age from 18-years-old to 21-years-old as well as prohibiting the sale of alcohol in a location no less than 500 metres away from a school.The bill also hopes to put restrictions on alcohol advertising in the country.&#8220;We are proposing to introduce liability to those that transgress the law as we currently have many illegal outlets which the amendment bill seeks to address,&#8221; said Davies.Recently the Department extended the deadline for public comments and submissions on the Bill to 30 November.&#8220;The Liquor industry is significant to our economy and we are not trying to prohibit alcohol but we do have a challenge as the current status quo isn&#8217;t working,&#8221; said Davies.Back in September, Cabinet approved publication of the bill which seeks to address the socio economic impact of liquor as well as address the slow pace of transformation.&#8211;TNA Reporter
