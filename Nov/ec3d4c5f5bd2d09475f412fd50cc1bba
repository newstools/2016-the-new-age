Want to impress the kids this Christmas? A Tokyo retailer has just the thing if you&#8217;ve got about $2.0 million to spare.Jeweller Ginza Tanaka is going all out this season with a two-metre (6.6-foot) Christmas tree made with pure gold wire that&#8217;s as fine as angel hair pasta.The shop in Tokyo&#8217;s glitzy Ginza district says the 19 kilogramme (42 pound) tree is made up of more than 1,200 metres (3,950 feet) of gold wire.&#8220;The wire is made of the finest gold which has a 99.999 percent purity level,&#8221; Ginza Tanaka store manager Takahiro Ito told AFP on Tuesday.Ito said the tree was made by the jeweler&#8217;s in-house artisans.The price tag? A cool 200 million yen ($1.8 million).While it may be a stretch finding a buyer, Ito said he hoped the opulent display would show off Japan&#8217;s world-famous craftmanship.&#8220;We want them to see our great technique and craftsmanship, and the glittering beauty of gold,&#8221; he said.-AFP
