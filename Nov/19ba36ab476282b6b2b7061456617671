Cosatu affiliates participating in the federation s Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting yesterday had their knives out for Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.The New Age was informed by a senior union leader that the CEC meeting has not failed to live up to expectations as Cosatu affiliates have openly aired their views on a basket of issues including the push to have Zwane sacked, the national minimum wage as well as the ANC s succession debate.The Cosatu official said the call came from the South African Democratic Teachers Union. A decision was taken to call for Zwane to be recalled because he has not been working with our unions. He d rather work with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said.Earlier in September, Cosatu called on President Jacob Zuma to fire Zwane for his apparent ambivalence towards rescue operations at the Langlaagte mineshaft and the Lily Mine disaster.Zwane also sparked Cosatu s ire after his claim that Cabinet had recommended the establishment of a judicial inquiry to probe why the country s major banks withdrew their services from Oakbay Resources.The official, making reference to the ANC s succession debate said consensus would be reached soon on Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa taking the reins in the ANC at the party s elective conference next year. There are unions saying that to avoid the issue where there are two centres of power, the president (Zuma) must leave office, the official said.The official said that Cosatu would table its socioeconomic report.At the time, he said the federation had yet to discuss the R3500 per month national minimum wage proposed by Ramaphosa and the commission tasked to investigate the modalities and feasibility of the wage.However, he said it was likely that Cosatu would reject the amount, which fell short of its proposal of R4500 per month. We are not happy about that. We called for R4500 and it will be rejected, the official said.Cosatu national spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said the second day of the federation s meeting was under way.National Education and Allied Workers Union president Mzwandile Makwayiba said this week the union would not budge on its call for Ramaphosa to lead the ANC next year. We will always present the views of our structures and members and we want Cosatu to debate the issue, he said.The Communication Workers Union said last week that although it had yet to decide on punting Ramaphosa for ANC president, the union also wanted Zuma to leave office.Bonolo Selebanobonolos@thenewage.co.za
