Pope Francis prays every day for a sense of humour to help him as head of the Catholic Church, but beware of laughing at his jokes &#8212; he can&#8217;t abide flatterers.&#8220;A sense of humour is a gift I ask for everyday. Because a sense of humour lifts you up, it shows your life is short and to take things in the spirit of a redeemer,&#8221; the pontiff says in a television interview with TV2000 set to air later Sunday.&#8220;It&#8217;s a human attribute, but it&#8217;s the closest to God&#8217;s grace&#8221;.The Argentine, 79, shot to international fame with his 2013 election but he has not let it go to his head, and is quick to deride attempts by the silver-tongued to befriend him.&#8220;I am allergic to flatterers. I&#8217;m allergic. Because flattering someone is using them for your own gains, whether it&#8217;s hidden or not, but in any case to get something for yourself,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We in Buenos Aires&#8230; call flatterers &#8216;sock-lickers&#8217;, and the image really sums it up, someone licking someone else&#8217;s socks. It&#8217;s horrid to chew on someone else&#8217;s socks&#8221;.Francis, who often labels himself a &#8216;sinner&#8217;, said he struggles to ward off temptations like other people, confessing his personal weaknesses are &#8220;impatience, selfishness and a little bit of laziness&#8221;.But he won&#8217;t mind if you criticise him: &#8220;My detractors speak ill of me, and I deserve it, because I am a sinner. That&#8217;s my opinion!&#8221;Asked how a pope who hardly ever takes a day off finds the energy to carry on, he explains &#8220;I sleep six hours, but like a log. That helps.&#8221;-AFP
