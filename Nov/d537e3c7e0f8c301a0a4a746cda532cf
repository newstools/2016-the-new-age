The National Assembly has passed the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill, which will now be forwarded to the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) for approval. Should that be done the bill will be sent to President Jacob Zuma to be signed into law. Zuma had referred the bill to Parliament because of his doubts over its constitutionality. Yesterday the House voted by 198 votes against 81 to pass the amended bill. There was one abstention. Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane reminded members of Parliament when he was appointed in September last year he had made a commitment that his department would do everything in its power to mobilise the swift processing of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill. Yesterday’s debate, he said, took place on the back of the recent commemoration of the birth of OR Tambo, one of the great ANC stalwarts. Zwane said: “We are spurred on by his words when he said ‘the fight for freedom must go on until it is won’. We believe this freedom includes the economic liberation of our people, through meaningful economic transformation.” Zwane said the concerns raised by Zuma were genuine and required further affirmation from legislators. “This is a demonstration of the president’s commitment to driving a constitutionally-inspired transformation of the economy.” Zwane said he would like to assure members that the government was approaching this subject with the utmost responsibility and sensitivity. “You are aware the MPRDA has vested the country’s mineral resources in the hands of the state. The gains we have made can be accelerated and amplified with the processing of this bill. I call on members to support the position that we have taken in national interest. We have to use our collective might to deal with this subject in a manner that ensures we re-industrialise our country, diversify our energy mix, contribute to food security and strengthen the national fiscus.” -Dennis Cruywagen
