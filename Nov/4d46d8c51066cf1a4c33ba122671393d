NORTH West police who have excelled in their operations and put the name of the South African Police Service on the map will be honoured this week.Provincial police commissioner Lt Gen Baile Motswenyane said she would be hosting the annual provincial excellence awards at Hartbeespoort Dam on Friday.The awards are meant to celebrate the sacrifices of the men and women in blue who go all out to work for peace and order in the province.The awards ceremony will be held at the Eagle Waters Resort starting at 11am. The purpose of the excellence awards is to support and give effect to the achievement of the strategic objectives of the SAPS. This also provides managers with a mechanism to facilitate an overall improvement of employee morale and to institutionalise a culture of positive behaviour and innovation in service delivery, Motswenyane said.She said that a number of categories would be on offer and officers had to fight it out for honours.Some of the officers will be rewarded for their special talents in areas like sports where they could have represented the province or even the nation. Officers will be awarded on different categories including the woman and sportsman of the year. This year, special awards to honour the premier and the MEC have been added, the commissioner said.Community safety and transport management MEC, Dr Mpho Motlhabane is expected to deliver the keynote address.With the police expected to be busy as the festive season approaches, the awards are seen as providing a necessary incentive for everyone in the SAPS to give their all.Issues like drug trafficking have kept police officers busy, especially in areas like Mahikeng, Klerksdorp, Potchefstroom and Rustenburg.Ports of entry have provided a fair share of success stories where contrabands of drugs and other illegal substances have been intercepted by the police.-ELFAS TORERAI
