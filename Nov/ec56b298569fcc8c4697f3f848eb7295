The airline industry has been quick to act on the results of the stunning US election with special post-election airfares launched to help shell-shocked travelers escape.In a move that plays on the discontent in America &#8212; or that of the crestfallen Hillary Clinton supporters, anyway &#8212; Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair has launched bottom of the barrel airfares for as low as $10 USD ( 7.99).The airline has set aside one million seats for its &#8220;US Election Special.&#8221; With taglines like &#8220;No one Trumps Ryanair Fares&#8221; and &#8220;Even she wouldn&#8217;t delete our email offers,&#8221; the election special covers flights between European cities.For $10, for example, those in London thinking of embarking on cross-European travels can fly from London Stansted to Dusseldorf, Germany or Luxembourg.
