Audi is aiming to create an exclusive light show for this year&#8217;s LA Auto Show with the official unveiling of the Audi R8 V10 plus exclusive edition supercar.To mark the US government&#8217;s legalization of laser beam headlamps, Audi will be celebrating later this month with a very special version of its flagship 550hp all-wheel-drive supercar.Packed to the brim with every possible optional extra and creature comfort the company currently offers &#8212; including laser headlamps &#8212; the R8 V10 plus exclusive edition will be limited to just 25 numbered examples once it has made its LA Auto Show debut.Each model will be finished in special Quantum Grey paint with Solar Orange highlights. The car will sit on gloss black 20-inch alloys, and exposed carbon fiber front and rear spoilers, side air vents and mirror housings.If those details aren&#8217;t enough to make this R8 stand out from others, the car projects the R8&#8242; logo on the ground as a guiding light for walking to and from the car and when the doors are opened, the door sills also light up with the legend &#8220;one of 25&#8221;.Inside the cabin is trimmed in leather and even the luggage compartment is dressed in Alcantara. Carbon shell sports seats are standard, as is an extra rear luggage shelf and a 12 o&#8217;clock marker on the sports steering wheel in Solar Orange.However, it&#8217;s the laser lights that Audi really wants owners to focus on. One of the biggest safety innovations of recent years, the laser headlamp can illuminate the road ahead like no other lighting system currently in production. The beam is wider, more focused and whiter than LED or bi-xexon systems and can project much further into the distance.Developed and marketed aggressively by Audi and BMW it has become as much a status symbol and source of bragging rights as the cars to which said lights are fitted. But not in the US, where until now, the laser light has been outlawed pending government testing and approval.Yet, even though Audi can now offer its North American clients laser lighting, its matrix LED lighting systems are still unavailable.The 2016 LA Auto Show opens its doors to the public on November 18.-AFP
