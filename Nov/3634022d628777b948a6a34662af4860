To have a safer living environment, a joint effort by all stakeholders is required, Ntili said.The initiative comes after Premier Sylvia Lucas pleaded with motorists, pedestrians and the community at large to keep safe during the holidays.Lucas spoke recently at the launch of a safer festive season in De Aar.She said all those who disregard the rule of law will not be tolerated and would be dealt with decisively to ensure that communities are safer for everyone. High police visibility will be a central aspect to policing during this festive season. The SAPS has given us the assurance that they have the necessary resources and most importantly, they have the commitment of all the police officers who will go an extra mile. She said the launch was not only to create awareness around safety but also to highlight the challenges faced in the province such as social ills and economic disparities. Once more, as we have done every year, we call upon all road users, including pedestrians, to listen and respond to the important messages communicated through the Arrive Alive campaign, Lucas said.tiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
