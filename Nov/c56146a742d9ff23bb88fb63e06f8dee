THE national Treasury has backtracked and come out in support of the proposed national minimum wage (NMW), saying it represents a balanced, thoughtful and constructive approach to addressing the challenges of inequality and unemployment.When the proposed minimum wage of R3500 a month was announced on Sunday, the Treasury raised eyebrows when it said it would likely lead to close to a million job losses and shrink the economy by more than 2%.The country has been debating fiercely on the minimum wage issue, as all sectors of society deliberate on the figure whether it s most acceptable.Some feel it will play a role in economically empowering people while others feel it is not sustainable and will ultimately have dire consequences for the economy.In a statement yesterday Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said: We believe that the panel (of experts) has taken all the submission into consideration in coming up with a framework that seeks to support inclusive economic growth.We encourage all stakeholders and South Africans to participate in, and support actively this collective effort to address fault lines, like inequality in society and in the economy. The minister said the panel s report represented a balanced, thoughtful and constructive approach to addressing the challenge of inequality and unemployment.Earlier in the week, the country s biggest business bloc, Business Unity South Africa (Busa) also voiced its views on the subject.The organisation said it was committed to the quest for economic justice and inclusive growth. We will need to consult diligently with members to understand the potential impact of the recommendation on different sectors and types of businesses. We need to interrogate the report in relation to the wage and employment trade-off, the Busa statement said.-SAMUEL MUNGADZE
