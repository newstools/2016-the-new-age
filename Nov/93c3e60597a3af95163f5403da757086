Egypt&#8217;s Court of Cassation overturned on Tuesday a life sentence against deposed President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood and ordered a retrial in the case that revolves around accusations of espionage with Palestinian group Hamas.The court last week overturned a death sentence against Morsi in a separate case, meaning he no longer faces execution.Democratically elected after the 2011 uprising, Morsi was overthrown in mid-2013 by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following mass protests against his rule, and was immediately arrested.He remains in jail on a separate espionage conviction.-Reuters
