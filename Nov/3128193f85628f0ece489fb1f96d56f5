A dream debut for Southampton&#8217;s latest teenage talent Josh Sims ensured a nightmare return to St Mary&#8217;s for former manager Ronald Koeman whose lacklustre Everton side were beaten 1-0 in the Premier League on Sunday.The 19-year-old winger is the latest youngster off the club&#8217;s academy production line and took just 43 seconds to justify his starting place, scooping the ball on to Charlie Austin who headed Southampton into the lead from close range.It was a spectacular start for a side who failed to muster a single shot on target against Liverpool the previous week and Sims almost doubled the score with a header when unmarked close to the goal before the break.Koeman has had to give Everton several halftime gee-ups this season but the visitors were little better in the second half when Austin was denied a second goal by a sprawling save from Maarten Stekelenburg and James Ward-Prowse put one effort wide and had another cleared off the line.-Reuters
