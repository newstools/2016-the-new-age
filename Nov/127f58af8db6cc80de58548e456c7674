Germany winger Serge Gnabry, who scored a hat-trick on his debut in the 8-0 victory over San Marino on Friday, initially thought his call-up to the national team by coach Joachim Loew was a hoax.Gnabry became the first German to score three goals on his international debut for 40 years during the World Cup qualifier.&#8220;The coach called me up but I had to think about it for a bit whether it was true or not,&#8221; he told German media company RND.&#8220;There are so many hoax calls from radio shows and I really did not want to be a victim of that.&#8221;The speedy 21-year-old, joint top scorer and silver medallist at this year&#8217;s Olympic Games, has enjoyed a meteoric rise this season after joining Werder Bremen from Arsenal.He failed to win a regular first-team place following his move to the Premier League club in 2012.&#8220;I would not be the player I am today without England,&#8221; Gnabry said.&#8220;For example Arsenal&#8217;s quick game which I learned. If you train as a young man with top players for three years then it is clear you will improve.&#8221;&#8211;Reuters
