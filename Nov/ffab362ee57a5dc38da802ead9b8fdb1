Following protests over the Sanral N2 Wild Coast toll road (N2WCTR) construction project, the agency yesterday announced the establishment of an independent environmental monitoring committee to oversee the project and address concerns from communities and stakeholders. With the developments and construction progressing at a satisfactory pace, we are pleased to announce the establishment of an oversight committee responsible for monitoring environmental compliance, Mpati Makoa, Sanral environmental manager, said.Despite environmental authorisation in 2010 from the Department of Environmental Affairs, a coalition of major industries south of Durban took Sanral to the high court challenging the authorisation on the basis that there had not been a proper social and economic impact assessment.Fierce opposition from, among others, the KwaZulu-Natal legislature and environmental groups, has seen the project stall on several occasions.Makoa said the establishment of the committee was in line with some of the agreements reached between Sanral and stakeholders. The environmental monitoring committee for the N2WCTR comprises representation of South African conservation and wildlife organisations, environmental subject matter experts, various government departments, local municipalities and representatives of the traditional authorities of Mpondoland. This is in line with the recommendations and requests of the department. The committee will perform watchdog, monitoring and auditing functions to ensure compliance with specific conditions of the environmental authorisation and the requirements of the approved environmental management programme and conditions of all other environmental permits issued for the project, Makoa said.The committee will be the forum for the discussion and resolving of environmental issues which stakeholders might raise from time to time. Makoa was adamant the project would have a minimal impact on the environment. The route has been planned to minimise the impact on environmentally sensitive biomes and existing human communities and settlements and where possible to enhance positive environmental outcomes. These measures include a search and rescue process through which rare, endangered and endemic species and species of conservation value will be translocated to suitable nurseries to assist with the rehabilitation of disturbed areas after construction and to re-establish in an existing conservation area where applicable, she said.CLIVE NDOU
