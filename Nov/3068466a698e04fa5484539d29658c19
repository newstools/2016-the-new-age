The Obama Administration has said it stands behind US presidential election results as they &#8220;accurately reflect the will of the American people&#8221; and believes the polls were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective.The defense of the US elections from the Obama Administration came amidst hacking fears and allegations of hacking from Russia.&#8220;The Kremlin probably expected that publicity surrounding the disclosures that followed the Russian Government-directed compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organisations, would raise questions about the integrity of the election process that could have undermined the legitimacy of the President-elect,&#8221; a senior administration official said.&#8220;Nevertheless, we stand behind our election results, which accurately reflect the will of the American people,&#8221; the official said in response to a question.According to the official, the Federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyber activity aimed at disrupting the US electoral process on election day.&#8220;As we have noted before, we remained confident in the overall integrity of electoral infrastructure, a confidence that was borne out on election. As a result, we believe our elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective,&#8221; the official said.&#8220;That said, since we do not know if the Russians had planned any malicious cyber activity for election day, we don&#8217;t know if they were deterred from further activity by the various warnings the US government conveyed,&#8221; he said.Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus in a memo asserted that the electoral victory of its candidate Donald Trump was truly a national victory.&#8220;Nearly three weeks after the presidential election, the numbers showing President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s commanding victory are coming more fully into focus. He won 306 electoral votes, the most for a Republican since George H W Bush in 1988,&#8221; Priebus said.&#8220;He carried 9 of 13 battleground states. Millions of Americans rallied behind his message of rebuilding our country and disrupting the status quo. This was a truly national victory,&#8221; said Priebus, who has been appointed as the chief of staff by Trump.&#8220;President-elect Donald Trump won over 2,600 counties nationwide, the most since President Reagan in 1984. Additionally, he won over 62 million votes in the popular vote, the highest all-time for a Republican nominee. Voters everywhere wanted Donald Trump as their president,&#8221; he said.Also, Trump won over 200 counties nationwide that Obama won in 2012. This was the most counties won by a Republican since 1984, he said.Priebus said Trump&#8217;s message resonated with voters in historically blue states as he registered the first GOP win in Wisconsin since 1984, Pennsylvania and Michigan since 1988 and Iowa since 1984.&#8220;President-elect Donald Trump campaigned in places he knew Republicans have had difficulty winning&#8211;Flint, Michigan, charter schools in inner-city Cleveland, and Hispanic churches in Florida&#8211;because he wanted to bring his message of economic empowerment to all Americans,&#8221; he said.-AP
