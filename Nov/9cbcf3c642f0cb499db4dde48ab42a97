National Treasury has dismissed claims on Tuesday that it is investigating South African Revenue services(SARS) regarding the so called Rogue Unit . It is important to point out that National Treasury first learnt about the unit through the media, Treasury said in a statement.The department further said it is in a process of investigating the allegations and also to seek clarity from SARS on the claims but reiterated that there were no investigations that is currently taking place.Since stories broke in 2014 that SARS was operating a rogue unit, there have been a number of investigations, each making similar findings that the unit operated unlawfully.An investigation by KPMG concluded that considering his position as the accounting officer, Gordhan ought to have known of the existence of the unit. This aspect requires further investigation. Accusations are that in now Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&#8217;s capacity as then SARS commissioner, a position he held until 2009, he facilitated the creation of a rogue unit that unlawfully spied on citizens.In May, Gordhan was asked by the Hawks to answer 27 questions on the recommended investigation, which he did.He was told by Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza that he was not a suspect in the matter. I therefore, do not intend to present myself for a warning statement for many considerations, both legal and given my other commitments. I remain committed to assist the Hawks in any bona fide investigation as stated in my statement, he said.-Sipho Jack
