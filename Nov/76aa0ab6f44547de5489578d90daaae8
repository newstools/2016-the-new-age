Venezuela&#8217;s political rivals are to sit down at the negotiating table Friday to resume fraught talks on the country&#8217;s volatile crisis.Socialist President Nicolas Maduro and his opponents declared a &#8220;truce&#8221; 10 days ago to ease tension in a country struck by food shortages.Their political struggle had provoked mass street protests and stern warnings from the government.With Pope Francis&#8217;s blessing, they agreed to sit down to Vatican-mediated talks starting Friday.The outlook appears hostile.&#8220;The truce that we agreed ends on Friday,&#8221; said the opposition MUD coalition leader Jesus Torrealba.&#8220;We are going to the dialogue table to demand that the people&#8217;s right to vote be restored.&#8221;Under the truce, the opposition suspended mass street protests and moves to hold a political trial against Maduro.But the sides continued exchanging insults and refused to back down from their clashing demands.The center right-dominated opposition insists on holding a referendum on removing Maduro from power but his allies have blocked that effort.Under constitutional rules, the opposition must secure a referendum before January 10 if it wants to remove Maduro. Otherwise he or his allies will keep power until 2019.&#8220;We Venezuelans do not have much time,&#8221; said senior opposition leader Henrique Capriles.&#8220;We cannot spend months sitting here face to face. There has to be a change.&#8221;Venezuela is rich in oil but short of food.An economic crisis sparked by falling crude prices has led to shortages of basic supplies and soaring inflation.The opposition blames Maduro&#8217;s economic management. He calls the crisis a capitalist conspiracy.&#8220;I am not obsessed with being a presidential candidate nor with being reelected,&#8221; Maduro said on Thursday.&#8220;Fixing the economy is my obsession.&#8221;Small crowds of students resumed rallies in Caracas on Thursday.&#8220;We are going to stay in the streets,&#8221; said student leader Hasler Iglesias.&#8220;We demand a timetable for elections, or the relaunch of the referendum.&#8221;Analysts say there is a risk of violent unrest. Clashes at anti-government riots in 2014 left 43 people dead.Maduro has the public backing of the military high command and control of most state institutions.&#8220;The likelihood that the government in negotiations will accept a referendum or early elections is practically zero,&#8221; said analyst Luis Vicente Leon.&#8220;Maduro is absolutely certain that would mean handing them his head.&#8221;Donald Trump&#8217;s victory in the US presidential election adds tension and uncertainty to the situation.Venezuela&#8217;s foreign ministry said Maduro had told US Secretary of State John Kerry on the phone that he hoped for &#8220;positive work&#8221; with Trump.But Maduro has had testy relations even with the more moderate current US leader Barack Obama. He accuses Washington of plotting his overthrow.Obama&#8217;s administration had nevertheless boosted contact with Venezuelan authorities in a bid to ease the crisis.But Obama only has two months left in office.&#8220;Trump&#8217;s aggressive and threatening discourse will be the perfect excuse to strengthen the theory about Venezuela&#8217;s external enemies,&#8221; Leon said.AFP
