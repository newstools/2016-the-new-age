Several job seekers are crying foul after they paid money to unknown people with the hope that they would get employment at Polokwane and Blouberg municipalities respectively. Recently, five victims fell prey to the job scam and were asked (by phone) to deposit money ranging from R150 to R350 through cash transfer systems at certain shops for uniforms and medical certificates, Polokwane municipality spokesperson Disree Manyane, said.A woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, said she was impressed when a caller using a private number told her about details on her CV and offered her a job. I suspect he got my CV from employment agencies because I dropped several of them at agencies. At first I believed the money I paid was for medical certificates but became suspicious when the municipality officials told me in my face that there was no such person in their staff, she said.Manyane emphasised that people should be aware that the municipality would not call people for interviews using private or cell phone numbers. All our advertised positions will be available in newspapers and on municipal websites for suitable candidates to apply. The municipality is conducting internal investigations for cases brought forward. All victims who were defrauded are advised to open criminal cases at police stations, she said.In Blouberg municipality, the fraudster allegedly identified himself as Mr Molepo and asked job seekers to deposit R1 500 into a certain bank account. The scam is in relation to learnership positions which were advertised but have since closed. People should not make payments to anyone as all opportunities offered by the municipality are free, said Blouberg municipality spokesperson Peter Moruthane.Anyone with information that can be used to trace the scammer is advised to call 0155057100-22-24.MONTSHO MATLALA montshom@thenewage.co.za
