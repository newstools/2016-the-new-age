As more than 13000 pupils who sat for their 2016 matric exams nervously await their results, the provincial government is confident the results will be better than last year.Exams were concluded on November 29, marking starts on December 1 and the results will be released in January. The province had 11 993 full-time Grade 12 candidates who sat for exams, a drop of 180 from 12 173 last year.More than 1 500 candidates who wrote were studying part time. Last year the province achieved a 69.4% pass rate, a drop from 76.4% in 2014. This year we are confident that we have done all there was to do to ensure that we improve our pupils future towards a better life. Our plan was aimed at improving our pupil performance at all levels, with the emphasis on Grade 12, Northern Cape education MEC Martha Bartlett said. She said the province had made several interventions to help matrics especially the 2 570 progressed pupils.Progressed pupils are those sent forward from Grade 11 to Grade 12 even though they did not do well. Progressed pupils are indeed close to our hearts and we did all we could to provide them with the necessary support, Bartlett said.Some of the interventions put in place included autumn schools, compulsory classes on weekends, winter camps, psycho-social support and spring schools.Barlett said that the province also put in place strategies to ensure that there were no leakages during the exam period. Limpopo was the only province dented by leakage of matric papers via a smartphone application in the 2016 exams.KwaZulu-Natal was hit with group copying allegations in 2014 which resulted in more than 3 000 pupils rewriting last year.Bartlett said Northern Cape education officials worked hard to ensure that there were no irregularities, especially group copying and no possession of unauthorised electronic devices like cellphones in exam rooms. The focus of the 2016 NSC irregularity prevention strategy was on the following: quality invigilation, subjecttargeted monitoring, safe invigilation time tables, prioritisation of monitoring and involvement of all departmental officials and focus on the monitoring capacity in high risk centres, she said.Marking will end on December 18 and basic education s head office will do final checking from December 26, with the results expected to be released on January 5.BATANDWA MALINGObatandwam@thenewage.co.za
