Aid group Oxfam South Africa has called for the immediate implementation of free, quality and decolonised higher education in the country.This was part of the group s submission to the ongoing fee commission sitting in Pretoria looking at the feasibility of free education and training within the sector. Further education is a right. In view of the established fact, clearly the government is the duty bearer in this case. Nowhere in the text of the Constitution is there a suggestion that this responsibility may be shared with either parents, business sector, students or any other stakeholder for that matter, Oxfam said.The commission was set up in January following months of unrest at a number of institutions of higher learning under the #FeesMustFall campaign.Despite the commission s work, protests demanding free and decolonised education at a number of universities resulted in the burning and destruction of university property and academic disruptions recently.The commission has already processed hundreds of submissions which have called for free education. Institutions of higher learning that made presentations maintained that achieving free education was possible, but the government would have to fund it.Oxfam has appealed to the commission to come up with a model that will curb the levels of inequality among students. The legacy of apartheid gave rise to underfunded universities for the Bantustans for the majority black population, high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment, and the escalating cost of tertiary education vis- -vis tertiary education age means youths do not own assets nor earn a reasonable income for them to afford tertiary education at current prices, it said. 701233-TNA Reporter
