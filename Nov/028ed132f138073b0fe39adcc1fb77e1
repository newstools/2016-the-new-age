President Jacob Zuma has on Friday added his voice to the multitudes which have condemned the horrific attack of Victor Mlotshwa who was while alive placed in a coffin, calling the incident &#8220;despicable in the extreme.&#8221;Zuma was speaking in East London during the annual address by the President to the National Council of Provinces.&#8221; The perpetrators of this crime and all others who commit various acts of racism in our non-racial democracy must face the full might of the law,&#8221; said Zuma.&#8221; We have urged the Department of Labour and other departments to ensure improved monitoring of the working and living conditions of farm workers,&#8221; continued Zuma.The President said the incident was yet another reminder of deep-seated racist attitudes that remain in South Africa and of whites who still regard black people as lesser human beings.&#8221; This incident is also a reminder of the need to continue fighting for a better life for farm workers. Given the secluded nature of farm work, many suffer in silence,&#8221;said Zuma.The two farmers accused of assaulting Rethabile Mlotshwa and forcing him into a coffin, Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson, will spend Christmas and New Year behind bars after their case was postponed to January 25 for further investigation on Thursday.The two farmers decided not to apply for bail since they fear for their lives.Mlotshwa said in a sworn police statement he was tortured for an hour and was threatened to be killed if he tried to run away.Zuma on Friday added that the matter had brought into sharper focus the question of access to land by black people.&#8221; Government continues to look for ways of speeding up the process and also to support those who have re-gained the land to use it profitably.&#8221; Zuma said.&#8220;Since 1994, the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform through the redistribution programme has transferred 4.7 million hectares of land. This is made up of five thousand two hundred and eighty one projects amounting to R12 billion and more than one hundred and twenty thousand households have benefited from the redistribution,&#8221; Zuma said.&#8220;The Commission on the Restitution of Land Rights have also transferred more than 1,9 million hectares to restitution beneficiaries since 1994 and the programme continues to be implemented and government will continue to process land claims and assist communities to get their land back.&#8221; said Zuma.Meanwhile the President announced that residents of the Limpopo province are set to be beneficiaries of the first High Court building to be constructed since 1994 when the high court opens later this month.&#8221; We are very pleased to bring the wheels of justice closer to the people of the Limpopo Province.&#8221; said Zuma.According to the President the court&#8217;s main seat will be in Polokwane and two local seats, in Lephalale and Thohoyandou.The high court which is 48 000 square meters will feature 7 floors, 17 new court rooms, 21 judges chambers, 387 offices, and a parking lot among other facilities .Despite experiencing a number of difficulties during the construction phase including amongst others the death of a worker on site as well as the liquidation of the first main contractor the court was due to be handed over soon.&#8211;TNA Reporter
