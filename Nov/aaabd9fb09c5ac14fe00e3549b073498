It may be hard to believe, but Springbok assistant coach Matt Proudfoot has claimed that the Boks want to make a big statement in their last game of the year against Wales on Saturday.The Boks have struggled against the Welsh in South Africa, where they lost to the side that is now coached by Robert Howley in Cape Town in what was Allister Coetzee s first match in charge.While the Boks have lost to Australia, England, Italy, Argentina and New Zealand to name a few, Wales lost heavily to Australia. Though they did not produce the expected performance, they managed to narrowly beat Argentina and Japan, something that the team is still not impressed with.This means for the home game against South Africa, Wales will go all out to win. However, the Bok assistant coach said they have derived a new strategy and warned that the Boks will have to be brutal at the breakdown and be smart in their physical battles if they are to win on Saturday. There was a lot of intensity in our training session. You can see that the players are really wanting to make a statement. We had to tempter that enthusiasm and focus on our execution and improve certain aspects of our game. Our major focus is continuity and how we apply ourselves in the breakdowns. We need to be more effective and generate quick ball, Proudfoot said. We expect Wales to come out and put us under pressure. They have a good pack. They have great experience in the backline. They take you to the width and they have a smart kicking game. They will be firing. We will have to play a smart, physical game to combat their strategies. The Boks are sweating on the fitness of flanker Willem Alberts ahead of Saturday s game after the 32-year-old Stade Francais forward picked up a knock in the defeat to Italy.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
