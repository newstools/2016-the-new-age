Proteas all rounder Vernon Philander said he was frustrated while out of the team for seven months. &#8220;I had to do physio and rehab quite a bit and all-in-all to come down here and put in the performances for the team is satisfying for me personally,&#8221; Philander said. He also had some kind words for the team&#8217;s bowlers during the day-night game against Australia. The 31-year-old got got himself 12 wickets and 136 runs at the end of the series, in a man-of-the-series performance. #CSAnews Australia win 3rd Test; Philander named Player of Series https://t.co/75x7xMwkwG pic.twitter.com/m5DFTiUHL2 Cricket South Africa (@OfficialCSA) November 27, 2016 It s always exciting when you have a young bowling attack, he added. The guys gelled well; the way Kyle (Abbott) came in and stepped up to the plate was unbelievable, KG (Rabada) bowled phenomenally well throughout the series. It s exciting looking forward working with those two over the course of the summer. I am getting into good positions, he said of his batting. I am feeling really confident about my batting, I worked a lot during those injured months on my batting and have really enjoyed batting out there, Philander said. He said the bowlers complemented one another, having three different three striking options and Faf du Plessis on the bowling workloads and changes. On his bowling duties for the team, he said it was difficult replacing the injured Dale Steyn. Great Test series for our boys. #ProteaFire #AUSvSA pic.twitter.com/Y1HjB30BR4 Cricket South Africa (@OfficialCSA) November 27, 2016 &#8220;In saying that, it leaves an opportunity for someone else to step up. I think the guys have really worked hard and each one has stepped up in different stages throughout the series. We pride ourselves on bowling teams out and it was a phenomenal performance from each player in the attack, the Proteas player concluded. TNA Reporter
