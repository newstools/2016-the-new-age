Without a doubt Golden Arrows are enjoying their best form at the moment but coach Clinton Larsen has urged his players to be on their guard when they take on Africa s CAF champions Mamelodi Sundowns. The high-flying Abafana Bes thende will visit Sundowns in a Premiership fixture at Loftus Stadium in Pretoria tomorrow.Both teams are fresh from claiming victories at the weekend, with the Tshwane side edging Kaizer Chiefs 2-1 while Arrows defeated Highlands Park 1-0. Zimbabwean midfielder Danny Phiri scored the solitary goal which saw the Durban side move up to second spot on the table with 17 points, two points behind log leaders Bidvest Wits who have two games in hand. Larsen will be hoping for another three points against the reigning Champions League champions to consolidate their position or to top the log.However, the coach knows that beat ing the defending champions, who are desperate to catch the leaders, won t be a walk in the park. Yes, they are the best team on the continent so we will need to stay humble. We will keep our feet on the ground and work as hard as we did on Sunday against Highlands Park, Larsen said. There are no easy games in this league, we keep saying this as coaches, regardless of who or where you play, especially away from home it s tough. Though Larsen was happy over the victory over Highlands, he was not impressed with the way his side played in the first half. Coming into this game with the suspended Kagiso Dikgacoi and Nkanyiso Mngwengwe as well as Lehlohonolo Nonyane being injured and Clifton Miheso sick, it was always going to be a difficult trip for us. We had to shuffle the team around but are happy with the way our players adjusted, taking into consideration all the forced changes. Arrows will still be without Dikgacoi and Mngwengwe who are both suspended, however they have goalkeeper Maximillian Mbaeva and Nkanyiso Cele available for action.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
