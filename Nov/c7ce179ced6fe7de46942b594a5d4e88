The Democratic Alliance(DA) has on Tuesday received confirmation from Parliament that its motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma will be debated on Thursday.Acting Speaker of the National Assembly Lechesa Tsenoli confirmed in a letter to the DA&#8217;s Chief Whip John Steenhuisen that the motion was now part of Parliament&#8217;s schedule.In the letter Tsenoli indicates that speaker Baleka Mbete has, since a National Assembly Programme Committee meeting on 3 November, been in the process of consulting with the Leader of Government Business and Chief Whip of the ANC on scheduling of the motion.The Acting Speaker has confirmed that the Motion of No Confidence will be debated on Thursday, 10 November. #ZumaOrSA pic.twitter.com/TYGBHZx6o6 Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) November 8, 2016The motion has recently seen the DA consider legal action against Speaker Baleka Mbete after they accused her of delaying the scheduling of the motion.John Steenhuisen expressed his exasperation last week that DA leader Mmusi Maimane had at the time written 18 days ago to Mbete, informing her of the DA s intention to table the motion in terms of Section 102 of the Constitution and Rule 129 of the National Assembly.He said that the delay by Parliament to respond to the matter was untenable. The delay which has dogged this motion has been raised numerous times, to no avail, Steenhuisen said.The ANC in Parliament on Sunday indicated it would not take part in the DA s legal wrangling with National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete, ANC parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said. It s a matter between the office of the speaker and the DA, he said.DA leader Mmusi Maimane has been lobbying ANC members of Parliament to vote against Zuma next on Thursday.He said the DA did not ask for an impeachment motion because for it to be passed, it would require a two-thirds majority. A simple motion of no confidence relies on a simple majority, Maimane said.Asked if the DA should not wait until the Judicial Commission of Inquiry recommended by Thuli Madonsela in her state capture report had been formed and completed its work, he said SA and South Africans have lost confidence in President Zuma. That s why they are marching against him. And you must give an effect to that if you are a decent and an honest member of Parliament, Maimane said.&#8211;TNA Reporter
