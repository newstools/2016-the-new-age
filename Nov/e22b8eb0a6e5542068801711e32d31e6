THE status of older persons in the office of Premier Ace Magashule will be throwing a party for centenarian Sesenyana Lizzy Moeng tomorrow in Rocklands near Bloemfontein.The chief director in the unit of women, children and people with disabilities Carol Mokobe, said older persons played an important role in the development and upbringing of children because they shared their wisdom.Many are guardians for grandchildren and role models in communities. In this regard, we will be celebrating Moeng s 101 birthday, acknowledge her achievement for reaching this milestone and she is still strong enough to look after her children and grandchildren, Mokobe said.She said older persons should remain integrated in society, participate actively in the formulation and implementation of policies that directly affected their well-being and share their knowledge and skills with younger generations. We treasure the elderly because they support us with love and we shall continue to celebrate and acknowledge their contribution in building a caring society for all, Mokobe said.Last year, Tsalaemang Emily Thinane and Gadihele Dorah Gaobotse from Bloemfontein were among senior citizens who also celebrated their 100th birthdays.-BECKER SEMELA
