A Rustenburg firm, Sitona Holdings, has approached the Mafikeng High Court seeking a gagging order against one of its directors after he went public with fronting and racism allegations.The company, which has substantial interests in mining, labour and plant hire, went to court after The New Age expos , in which the company confirms the director was brought into Sitona for BEE purposes and was presentable .Walter Kinnear, the majority shareholder of Sitona was in court on Thursday seeking an order to stop Mike Seeletsa, who holds 2% of the company, to refrain from making allegations pertaining to alleged BBBEE fronting practices and racist practices .Sitona is being accused by Seleetsa of fronting and racism and the director wants action to be taken by the government through the BEE Commission.Last month, The New Age broke the story that Seeletsa had reported his partners, Kinnear and Gerrie Koekemoer, for using him as a front to fulfil empowerment regulations.Seleetsa wants the company punished for abusing black people . Now, on Thursday, Kinnear s affidavit submitted in court, wants Seleetsa gagged from talking to the media until the matter is resolved in the main application, which is yet to be heard in Mafikeng High Court, because coverage of the story was posing a threat to his business. It is common cause that in this day and age in which we have in the Republic of South Africa, allegations pertaining to BBBEE fronting practices and racism, if condoned in a particular business environment, constitutes a serious and grave crime, Kinnear s affidavit says.He says the mining companies that Sitona had contracts with had already raised a red flag after The New Age report. He says firms such as Samancor Chrome, Glencore, Phoenix Platinum and Maseve Platinum would not tolerate allegations of BBBEE fronting and racism being allowed by their service providers .The court gave Kinnear temporary relief and Seleetsa s lawyer, Johan Pistorius, said his client should not be gagged as this infringed freedom of speech. Yesterday, Seleetsa s lawyer, Johan Pistorius, said the gag order had not been granted as yet, as the judge required more time to read the documents and a decision will be pronounced before the end the current term of the courts.The Sitona matter has once again brought into spotlight the issue of fronting.If the allegations are proven correct, this will have a devastating effect on Sitona Holding. Fronting undermines the purpose of the state s BEE policies and prevents benefits from reaching those it is meant to reach.Fronting perpetuates the systemic exclusion of black businesses from the economy, Corruption Watch says.The BEE Commission, which is investigating the matter, is already dealing with 112 cases of fronting allegations and 22 are allegations of improper verification processes such as presentation of fraudulent certificates.Samuel Mungadze| samuelm@thenewage.co.za
