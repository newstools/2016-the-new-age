President Jacob Zuma will take former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&#8217;s State of Capture report on judicial review.In a statement on Friday, the Presidency said Zuma &#8220;has considered and also sought legal advice on the contents of the report as well as the remedial action to be taken. The legal advice given and which advice has been accepted by the President is to take the remedial action on review.&#8221;According to the Presidency, &#8220;the basis for the review will be set out in the review application.&#8221;Meanwhile during a Question and Answer session in the National Assembly on Wednesday, Zuma raised questions about the state capture report.The President particularly expressed misgivings about the remedial action set out by Madonsela which says Zuma should establish a Judicial Commission of Inquiry, which should be chaired by a judge which has been nominated by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng.&#8220;The manner in which the report makes recommendations affects some of us who are mentioned there,&#8221; said Zuma.&#8220;The manner in which the recommendation is, it is the President who has the right to appoint a commission. No one, no matter what position they hold, can instruct the President to establish a commission and even set the process through which he must go. It&#8217;s very funny,&#8221; said Zuma.According to the Presidency, Zuma&#8217;s legal team is currently working on the review application to be served and filed within the time periods prescribed by the law.&#8220;The Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 provides that any proceedings for judicial review must be instituted without unreasonable delay and no later that 180 days from the date that the reviewable action was concluded,&#8221; the Presidency said.
