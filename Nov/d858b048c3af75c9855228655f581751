Last week, an Indonesian delegation visited South Africa, seeking to enhance and further strategically develop relations between South Africa and Indonesia.The delegation, which included Maj-Gen Yoedhi Swastono from the coordinating Ministry of Politics, Legal and Security, father Gregorious Neonbasu a Melanesian anthropologist from the province of the East Nusa Tengarra, as well as Fran Albertz Joku, a respected elder from the province of Papua, toured Cape Town in an effort to learn more about the history and heritage of South Africa, as well as enhancing bilateral cooperation between the two countries.Historically, Indonesia and South Africa have a long history, dating back to the 1600s when Indonesian Sheikh Yusuf was exiled to the Cape of Good Hope for assisting the rebellion against the Dutch.Many say that Yusuf s arrival in Cape Town can be attributed to the establishment of the Cape Malay Muslim community in Cape Town. Indonesia supported the ANC during its struggle to liberate South Africa from apartheid and after the victory of freedom and liberation in 1994, the Indonesian consulate was established in Cape Town.The visit from the Indonesian delegation comes after a previous agreement between the South African and Indonesian government and cooperation under the strategy outlined in the New Asia-Africa Strategic Partnerships framework, to increase trade between the two countries.The South African and Indonesian government recently signed a bilateral cooperation agreement, which was signed in the Indonesian capital of Jarkata ahead of the AfricaAsia summit. Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies said: It is through the strengthening of the relations between the emerging economies that we can actually realise the number of objectives, which we are setting ourselves. These will enable us to develop our economies, create employment for our people, and raise their living standards. The agreement has been intended to promote agriculture, maritime and marine sources and trade exchange between the two countries. At present, trade between South Africa and Indonesia stands at $2bn (R27bn), and is the largest economy in southeast Asia with a GDP of an estimated $1 trillion.South Africa exports a wide range of commodities to Indonesia, including chemicals, wood pulp, iron, fruit and mechanical parts. International Relations and Cooperation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane said we need to advance economic and trade relations between Indonesia and South Africa.At the Africa-Asia summit last year, Minister in the Office of the Presidency Jeff Radebe said the success will be for further development of economic relations in our countries including South Africa so that we can deal with underlying socio-economic conditions that give rise to some South Africans attacking foreign nationals , which was said in regard to an ongoing campaign from the South African government to combat xenophobia against foreign nationals.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and former deputy minister of international relations and cooperation Marius Fransman have also made efforts to facilitate cultural cohesion and friendship between the two countries.Amid the successful visit of the Indonesian delegation to South Africa, concerns were raised about the high rate of deforestation in Indonesia, which has led to more than half of the country s biologically rich landscape being harvested and destroyed for pulp, paper and palm oil, as more than 2.4 million hectares of ancient forest is cleared each year.Indonesia consists of 18000 islands and the Indonesian population of 99 million are reliant on the ecosystem.Ecologists have said the Indonesian forest has immeasurable value and the destruction of the rainforest could amount to economic losses.The arrival of the Indonesian delegation came just a few days after the South African parliamentary vote to sign the Paris Agreement on climate change, for which there were no objections.When questioned about the alarming rate of deforestation in Indonesia, Swastono said it was a concern and that the Indonesian government is looking into the issue.Chelsea Lotz is a writer and commentator
