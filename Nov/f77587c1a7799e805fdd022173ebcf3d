Tshwane Metro Mayor Solly Msimanga on Thursday announced that his administration has submitted supplementary affidavits showing that the smart meter contract, entered into in 2013 by the city&#8217;s previous administration, was irregular and irrational.&#8221; The serious irregularities that have marred this contract from its very inception have material implications for the City s ability to provide sustainable electricity to our residents. &#8221; said Msimanga.&#8220;The PEU contract threatens to unnecessarily hemorrhage much-needed public funds that could be useful in addressing other priority areas I have identified for the administration moving forward&#8230;we have decided to file supplementary affidavits asserting that indeed the deal entered into by the former ANC administration under Kgosientso Sputla Ramokgopa was irregular, irrational and must be declared unlawful and set aside on that basis. continued MsimanagaBack in September the Tshwane Mayor announced a review of the contract entered into with PEU Capital Partners. PEU at the time said it welcomed the review of the contract it signed with the city in 2013.PEU&#8217;s deal with the City was terminated in May 2015, with the city saying the contract was unaffordable. According to Msimanga, since entering into the contract the City of Tshwane has paid R2.6bn to PEU.&#8220;This administration will not be complicit in the swindling of the City and its residents by remaining a defendant in this matter and it is our intention to extricate the City from this contract that threatens to bleed it of its resources,&#8221; said Msimanga.The Tshwane Mayor was also critical of PEU itself saying &#8220;the contract in its current incarnation forces the City to surrender much-needed revenue to a service provider which we do not need,&#8221; said Msimanga.&#8220;PEU supplied the City with equipment that did not meet the minimum requirements at a cost way above industry standards,&#8221; continued Msimanga.In May the City confirmed it had appointed Accenture South Africa (Pty) Ltd to replace PEU Capital as the service provider for its smart metering project.On Thursday Msimanga added that &#8221; the Accenture deal will only be taken after the substantive review application into the validity of the contract is concluded.&#8221;Then In July, the city was stopped from paying R950m to Peu, pending the review of the contract.Previously Charges were laid with the police against former Mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa and former municipal manager Jason Ngobeni.-Siphiwe Mchunu
