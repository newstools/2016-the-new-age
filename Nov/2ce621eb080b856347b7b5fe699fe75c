South Africa and China have agreed to maintain close communication on major issues such as cyber security, transnational crime, terrorism, international economic and financial governance.The two countries will also support each other in hosting the Brics Summit in 2017 and 2018. This was announced by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa who on Tuesday co-chaired the 6th BiNational Commission with the Vice President of the People s Republic of China LI Yuanchao at Tuynhuis.According to Ramaphosa, the Department of Trade and Industry and China s Ministry of Commerce signed a memorandum of understanding regarding cooperation on Special Economic Zones and Industrial Parks.A deal was reached on a framework agreement between the Department of Trade and Industry and the National Development and Reform Commission of the People s Republic of China for developing cooperation on production capacity.The Bi-National Commission has become the key vehicle for facilitating cooperation between South Africa and China and is thus the umbrella of all other bilateral mechanisms. The BNC provided the opportunity to assess where there is a need to further expand the areas of cooperation .Ramaphosa said the Bi-National Commission received and deliberated on reports of the sectoral committees on foreign relations, trade and investment, science and technology, mining, energy and education. It reviewed the progress made in South African-Chinese relations over the past three years and identified the way forward for the continuously expanding bilateral relations. South Africa and China agreed that President Jacob Zuma s successful state visit to China in 2014 had resulted in the adoption of the five-to-ten year strategic programme for cooperation .The programme highlighted the important spheres of cooperation, which included areas such as the acceleration of South Africa s industrialisation process, Special Economic Zones, marine cooperation, infrastructure development, human resource cooperation and financial cooperation. Both sides also acknowledged the historically important state visit of President Xi Jinping to South Africa in December 2015. The important agreements signed during that visit and the outcomes of the Johannesburg summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (Focac) were being implemented in a comprehensive manner. The Focac summit reinforced China s commitment to the entire African continent in addressing our developmental needs. In particular, South Africa has identified crucial projects that will change the lives of many South Africans. The two countries will maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges and continue to support and coordinate with each other on issues of strategic interests and challenges for both China and South Africa, Ramaphosa said.Together China and South Africa, as Focac co-chairs, would enhance the Focac mechanism that would positively impact on the lives of all South Africans. Both countries agreed that the sharing of cultural activities, including exchanges and knowledge-sharing with their counterparts elsewhere in the world, is an important aspect of our relations, Ramaphosa said.TNA Reporternews@thenewage.co.za
