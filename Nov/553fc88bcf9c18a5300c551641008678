Gauteng high court judge president Dunstan Mlambo has warned against organisations and ordinary citizens using the courts to dictate how the government should do its work.This was just before the judge struck off the roll an application by lobby group Helen Suzman Foundation to have National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams suspended without being given an opportunity to make representations to the president.The application against Abrahams was dismissed with costs.Early this month, the foundation sent a letter to President Jacob Zuma giving him six days to suspend Abrahams for incompetence after he charged and later withdrew charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Our view is that the applicants (HSF)minds were already made up when they sent that letter to the president. They believed he had no choice but to adhere to their demands. They were not willing to listen to a different answer, the judge said.After yesterday s judgment, Abrahams will remain in office until President Jacob Zuma rules on his suitability to head the NPA.During the arguments, the question: If the National Prosecuting Authority is a plane driven by incompetent pilots, why has it not crashed in the past 40 days? was the core of the arguments by lawyers opposing the application.They submitted that it had been about 40 days since Pravin Gordhan s charging and withdrawal of charges, yet the NPA was still functioning properly. It is remarkable that those at the centre of this are not part of this application. That it is just civil organisations here, he said.Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza was representing Gauteng director of public prosecutions Sibongile Mzinyathi&#8211;Dudu Dube
