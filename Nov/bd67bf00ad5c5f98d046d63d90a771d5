Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak warned Thursday violence would not be tolerated at a major anti-government demonstration planned for the weekend.Leading NGO and civil-society alliance Bersih called the rally in the capital to demand the scandal-tainted prime minister&#8217;s resignation.Bersih has urged its supporters to converge on Kuala Lumpur in its signature yellow T-shirts on Saturday.But the &#8220;Red Shirts&#8221;, a rightwing group aligned to Najib and his ruling United Malays National Organisation, has vowed to confront protesters.Police have warned that tear gas and water cannons could be used.&#8220;You cannot indulge in any kind of physical clash at all,&#8221; Najib said Thursday, according to the official Bernama news agency.&#8220;That s not going to be good for us and that s not the culture that we will want to be accepted as our way of life in Malaysia.&#8221;Najib, who is currently visiting Japan, added: &#8220;If one side wants to protest and the side that wants to protect the government is compelled to come out &#8230; but I don t want any physical clash.&#8221;Firebrand Red Shirts leader Jamal Yunos has ominously warned that &#8220;anything can happen, including violence&#8221;.The Red Shirts are widely dismissed as ruling-party thugs-for-hire who seek to suppress any moves against Najib over a huge graft scandal.The rally is set to be the culmination of a seven-week Bersih campaign in response to the scandal involving the prime minister and state-owned fund 1MDB.Najib is clinging to power despite increasingly damaging allegations that he took part in the looting of billions in state funds.In an almost two-minute video posted online Wednesday, former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has been campaigning to oust Najib, said the country was &#8220;in a state of panic&#8221; over the scandal.Najib denies wrongdoing and says his accusers need to &#8220;move on&#8221;, but last year purged critics and shut down domestic investigations.-AFP
