THE provincial government is working hard to improve the lives of residents and the economy in the Victor Khanye local municipality, which is one of the six municipalities comprising the Nkangala district municipality.The government says the improvements will be brought through the construction of an industrial park, rehabilitation centre and skills hub.Premier David Mabuza made the assurance during a meeting with business people in the municipality at the weekend following their grievances as a result of the unpleasant environment in the municipality that hinders businesses progress.There was also a complaint that young people in the town of Delmas and surrounding areas had turned to alcohol and drug abuse.Mabuza said they were certain that the availability of the rehabilitation centre would play a vital role in eliminating such behaviour. I have personally observed that the youth here are always high on drugs.To deal with this problem of alcohol and drug abuse, we are going to open a rehabilitation centre and have these youths rehabilitated. If it push comes to shoves, we will have to take them forcefully for rehabilitation because we cannot allow these children to destroy themselves.I want to create a safe and conducive environment for all of you to do business, Mabuza said.He said the skills hub and an industrial park would assist with job creation in the municipality.This would be possible because local mining companies had already agreed to contribute money in the establishment of a skills hub in order to train the youth so that they would be absorbed and work in the mining sector. I am playing with the idea of creating an industrial park. Since there are so many mining companies in this area,we want to create businesses and house them in that industrial park that would do services in the mines. That industrial park can house businesses in agriculture and whatever business that is available in the agricultural sector could be sourced from the same industrial park, including the basic services such as welding and painting, they should be housed in the industrial park which would serve as a hub for small and big businesses, Mabuza said.francen@thenewage.co.zaFRANCE NYAKA
