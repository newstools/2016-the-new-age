Donald Trump&#8217;s daughter Ivanka, accused of a potential conflict of interest as she helms her own brand while making frequent appearances with her president-elect father, is separating her business and personal social media accounts.In a &#8220;letter&#8221; that appeared Tuesday on her Twitter and Instagram feeds, the businesswoman&#8217;s team said that her existing @IvankaTrump accounts &#8212; which have 2.4 million and 1.9 million followers, respectively &#8212; will now be for &#8220;personal&#8221; use.All information related to her clothing and jewelry brands, meanwhile, will appear on @IvankaTrumpHQ accounts.&#8220;As a private citizen, with full awareness of her heightened visibility, she will broaden her efforts to take a stance on issues of critical importance to American women and families,&#8221; the statement said.&#8220;Our company&#8217;s mission is not political &#8212; it never was and it never will be &#8212; however, Ivanka, personally, has an increased opportunity to advocate for women and be a positive force for change,&#8221; it added.Ivanka Trump, The Trump Organization&#8217;s vice president of development and acquisitions, and her two brothers, vice presidents at the conglomerate, have been called upon to manage their father&#8217;s fortune and affairs during his tenure at the White House.She stirred controversy when images released by the Japanese government showed the 35-year-old and her husband, real-estate developer and publisher Jared Kushner, standing and chatting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe when he met with the president-elect at Trump Tower in Manhattan last week.She also participated in a telephone conversation when Argentina&#8217;s President Mauricio Macri called her father, although the head of Argentine diplomacy has assured that she and the president only exchanged pleasantries.Donald Trump has also indicated that his son-in-law, Kushner, who is largely absent from social media, could help broker a deal to bring peace between Israel and the Palestinians.Kushner is from an Orthodox Jewish family. The businessman and investor was a close adviser to Trump during the election campaign.-AFPP
