The Mangaung metro is growing at a rapid pace and the transport infrastructure of the city needs to be aligned with the needs of a growing community. As a result, preparations are under way for the development of a new rapid transport system called the Integrated Public Transport Network (IPTN).The city has already started with the development of new roads to make way for the new system and has invested R30m in the first phase.This phase started in 2014 and the project includes non-motorised transport facilities, walkways, cycle lanes, facilities for people with disabilities and special truck routes.The second phase of the IPTN will be a system similar to the Re Ya Vaya system used in Johannesburg to link some townships to the inner city and then to surrounding suburbs starting from the south in places like Soweto, to Joburg s CBD, then Alexandra and Sandton in the north.The recent signing of the memorandum of agreement between the Mangaung metro and the taxi industry is a positive gesture that shows commitment from all parties to improve the lives of residents of the city.The city s mayor, Olly Mlamleli, signed an agreement with members of the various taxi associations that operate within the metro on the implementation of the IPTN project in Mangaung.This project will see members of the taxi industry, through shareholding, become owners of buses that will be used in the bus rapid system.The taxi associations that formed part of the agreement include Motheo District Taxi Council, Botshabelo Amalgamated Taxi Association, Greater Bloemfontein Taxi Association and Thaba Nchu Long &amp; Short Taxi Association.Part of the negotiations with the taxi industry were that ultimately there would be the establishment of a new Bus Operating Company owned by taxi and bus operators in terms of their shareholding.The IPTN is one of the biggest projects the city has undertaken and is being managed from the office of the city manager and supported by all departments within the city. Mlamleli said the agreement was a step in the right direction that would take the city to another level with regards to service delivery. The new transport system includes the construction of bus ways, bus stations (open and closed stations), new bus depots for the buses, procurement of buses that cater for persons with disabilities and the removal of taxis and buses that will be affected by the implementation of the system, Mlamleli told residents who had gathered at the signing ceremony.She said the sealing of the agreement gave effect to the provision of the National Land Transport Act 5 of 2009 which seeks to establish an integrated public transport network towards integration of public transport services between modes. This collective partnership enables us to take full advantage of infrastructure development investment in our space. Mangaung can now be counted among the cities that have designed and implemented the IPTN comprising of the bus rapid transport and non-motorised transport initiatives, she said.The IPTN was essential from a social impact, service delivery and for community inputs, she said. By this, the city undertakes together with other roleplayers in the public transport industry, to provide safe, efficient and affordable public transport. That is why the IPTN is one of our developmental priorities. This demonstrates our commitment to improving our local transport network for the maximum benefit of all the citizens of Mangaung, she said.Mlamleli said in the coming five years the city would commence with construction of three bridges to link the Bloemfontein townships with the city as well as reduce increasing traffic jams. Mlamleli said the three bridges were part of the city s mega plans for infrastructure development.kamogelos@thenewage.co.za
