West Ham United will be without Diafra Sakho for Wednesday&#8217;s League Cup quarter-final at Manchester United after he injured his hamstring in the Premier League draw between the sides at Old Trafford on Sunday.The Senegalese striker, a key figure for West Ham in the last two seasons, has just returned to fitness after being out since the start of the season with a back injury and scored early in Sunday&#8217;s draw before going off in the second half.Manager Slaven Bilic said he would miss the return visit to Old Trafford and fears he faces another spell out.&#8220;We will have to wait for the results of the scan to see how many weeks we will be without him,&#8221; Bilic told a news conference.&#8220;It is a big blow because we know what he can give to us and he showed that against Manchester United on Sunday. I can only hope it is not going to be long.&#8220;To be sidelined again is awful for him but I am sure this injury will not be like the one that forced him to miss the start of the season.&#8221;Better news for West Ham is that injury-plagued striker Andy Carroll could be in line for a return having been out since August with a knee injury.&#8220;Andy has had a good recovery and has been training with us,&#8221; Bilic said. &#8220;If he progresses well and there are not any minor setbacks he will definitely be ready for Saturday and we will make a decision about the United game after training.&#8221;West Ham travel to United just two wins away from a first domestic cup final since losing to Liverpool in the 2006 FA Cup final.However, they are only one point above the Premier League relegation zone and host Arsenal on Saturday.&#8220;The league is always the priority but this is a big game and the cup competitions are important for us,&#8221; said Bilic who hinted at some team changes.&#8220;It will be a big thing to reach the semi-finals and that is why we are approaching the game in a positive way. It would give us a lot of confidence if we could win the game.&#8221;The teams drew 1-1 at the weekend.-Reuters
