A public television station in Morocco apologised again on Monday after uproar on social media followed its broadcast of an item on makeup to hide the bruises of battered women.The sequence &#8212; marking last week&#8217;s International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women &#8212; was transmitted by 2M on the morning magazine programme &#8220;Sabahiyate&#8221; to &#8220;show the type of makeup to use when a woman has been hit&#8221;.It depicted a woman with a swollen face, with the presenter telling viewers that she was not really injured, but that these were just &#8220;cinematic effects&#8221;.&#8220;Green is applied with a brush to camouflage the reddish part&#8221;, followed by &#8220;an orange corrector then yellow, then a foundation&#8221;, she said.She added that the aim was to &#8220;provide solutions to women who need such advice so they can continue with their daily lives and go to work&#8221;.Last Wednesday&#8217;s broadcast initially passed unnoticed, but after it was posted on the channel&#8217;s website, by Friday it had provoked a storm of reaction on social media and was then removed.&#8220;So 2M has decided to celebrate the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women with anti-bruise makeup!&#8221; was one comment.Another social media user noted: &#8220;Ladies, 2M has the solution if you get punched in the face by your husband, father or brother.&#8221;&#8220;Black eye? Bruising? No problem! 2M&#8217;s makeup artist has a miracle product!&#8221; wrote yet another.The channel&#8217;s management issued a statement on Friday calling the broadcast sequence &#8220;completely inappropriate&#8221;, and offered its &#8220;most sincere apologies for this error, given the sensitivity and seriousness of the subject&#8221;.On Monday, in a video posted on Facebook, 2M again said it was sorry.&#8220;We have always put women at the centre of our debates and have taken the defence of their rights to heart,&#8221; it said.&#8220;We apologise for broadcasting the makeup segment, the result of an error of judgment on our part, and beg your indulgence and understanding.&#8221;Also Monday, in a commentary on worldwide efforts during 2016 to stem violence against women, Human Rights Watch acting women&#8217;s rights division director Janet Walsh wrote that Morocco was &#8220;still discussing a draft domestic violence law&#8221;.The New York-based HRW has said that violence against women is common in the North African country.It said an official study in 2009-2010 found that almost two thirds of Moroccan women had been physically, psychologically, sexually or economically abused, and that of those, some 55 percent said they had suffered domestic violence.&nbsp;-AFP
