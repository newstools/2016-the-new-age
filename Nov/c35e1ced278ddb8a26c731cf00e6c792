The Magistrate further labelled Dlamini as dishonest because he was made aware that he was not honest with the court.Roux said: the evidence in his affidavit is not convincing. The applicant was not always friendly and honest with the court. When Dlamini made his first brief court appearance, the state argued that he is a flight risk and might flee to Swaziland.His lawyer Mongezi opposed the state s request, citing he had tests to write at Witwatersrand University(Wits). It was however revealed that Dlamini is not registered at Wits.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale
