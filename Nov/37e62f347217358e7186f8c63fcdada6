Magistrate Albertus Roux said: It would not be in the interest of justice to release the applicant on bail. The Magistrate further labelled Dlamini as dishonest because he was made aware that he was not honest with the court.Roux said: the evidence in his affidavit is not convincing. The applicant was not always friendly and honest with the court. Judge Mokgoatlheng however stated that the refusal of bail for Dlamini was wrong. Premise on which magistrate refused to admit appellant to bail is clearly wrong not sound in law, said Judge Mokgoatlheng.-TNA Reporter
