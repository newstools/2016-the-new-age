South Africa&#8217;s fast bowler Dale Steyn has undergone surgery and will be out for at least six months after breaking a bone in his shoulder in the first test in Australia earlier this month, Cricket South Africa said on Sunday.The 33-year-old Steyn returned home for the operation in Cape Town, which was performed on Thursday, and had a screw inserted in his right shoulder blade.South African team manager Mohammed Moosajee said he will be out for a minimum of six months before he can even attempt to bowl again.&#8220;It is crucial to give the injury enough time to heal and to make sure that he is completely pain-free before he starts bowling again. He will begin with his rehabilitation programme once the satisfactory bone healing has taken place. This is expected to be in a few weeks,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We are positive that he will make a successful return to international cricket.&#8221;Steyn, who is just four wickets shy of Shaun Pollock, South Africa&#8217;s most successful test bowler, suffered the fracture while bowling on the second morning of the first test win over Australia in Perth.&#8220;I felt this pop or thud in my shoulder and I was in a lot of pain&#8230; and went for an MRI and I&#8217;ve got a clean fracture in the bone that is inside my shoulder. It&#8217;s not pretty,&#8221; Steyn told Australia&#8217;s Channel Nine the day after suffering the injury.&#8220;I just felt something go. I did something very similar against England in December in a similar area but it wasn&#8217;t as bad. That was a stress reaction which is like a very hairline fracture, a small crack.&#8221;Steyn missed almost all of the series defeat against England after injuring himself in the first test in Durban last December.He returned to play in March&#8217;s World Twenty20 and took eight wickets in August&#8217;s test win over New Zealand. He has 417 test wickets at an average of 22.30.-Reuters
