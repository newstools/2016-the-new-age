South Korean prosecutors investigating a corruption scandal engulfing President Park Geun-Hye questioned the head of the country&#8217;s largest steelmaker as well as a top Samsung executive on Saturday.Posco chief executive Kwon Oh-Joon was grilled overnight about allegations surrounding the 2014 sale of the company&#8217;s in-house advertising unit.Kwon was the first head of a major South Korean conglomerate to be questioned over the scandal centred on Park&#8217;s close personal friend Choi Soon-Sil.The allegations are that one of Choi&#8217;s associates attempted to force the company that bought Posco&#8217;s advertising subsidiary to hand over 80 percent of its shares.Kwon, 66, returned home early Saturday after undergoing 12 hours of intensive questioning at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors&#8217; Office, Yonhap news agency said.Prosecutors are investigating allegations that Choi, 60, leveraged her personal ties with Park to coerce donations from large companies like Samsung and Posco to non-profit foundations which she set up and used for personal gain.She is also accused of interfering in government affairs, despite holding no official position.Park Sang-Jin, a Samsung Electronics&#8217; president for corporate relations, was also questioned Saturday about reports that Samsung Electronics may have funnelled as much as 2.8 million euros ($3.1 million) to Choi to bankroll her daughter&#8217;s equestrian training in Germany.Park was quizzed four days after prosecutors raided Samsung Electronics&#8217; headquarters in Seoul.The world&#8217;s largest smartphone maker has said it will cooperate with any investigations.AFP
