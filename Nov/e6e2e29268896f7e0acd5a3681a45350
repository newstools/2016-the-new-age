The South African Reserve Bank&#8217;s Monetary Policy Committee(MPC) announced on Thursday a unanimous decision to keep the repo rate unchanged at 7% per annum.According to Reserve bank governor Lesetja Kganyago, risks to the inflation outlook have increased moderately with core inflation to peak at 5.8% in the fourth quarter.The Reserve bank governor added that a possible interest rate cut was not discussed by the MPC.According to Kganyago, global outlook remains uncertain following Brexit and the outcome of US elections, where Donald Trump emerged victorious ahead of Hilary Clinton.&#8220;The high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic policies of the new administration is expected to persist for some time, creating a more challenging and volatile environment for emerging markets in particular. &#8221; said Kganyago.&#8221; The prospect of rising protectionism and its implications for world trade are also a concern &#8221; continued Kganyago.The MPC arrived at the decision by factoring in a possible US rate increase at the end of the year however Kganyago added that the MPC does not follow basis point for basis point what the US does with its interest rate.The prime lending rate will remain at 10.5%.TNA Reporter
