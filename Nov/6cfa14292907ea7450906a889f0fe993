Lawyers representing Oakbay Investments say they had no choice but to approach the courts when the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) refused, without reason, to give the company information relating to alleged dubious transactions amounting to billions.The company s lawyer, Gert van der Merwe, said there was no indication yet whether the FIC would oppose the application, but that it had until Friday to respond.In October, a document forming part of an affidavit by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan against Oakbay, alleged that between 2012 and early this year, Oakbay made more than 70 suspicious transactions amounting to R6bn. A list of the said transactions was published in the media.In an affidavit filed by acting CEO Ronica Ragavan, Oakbay argues it has a right to the information as its release created a public perception that it was involved in dubious and corrupt affairs. It is within the rights of the applicants to insist on the information in order to deal with this perception and to restore its integrity and good name, the court papers read.The company submits that it intends to deal with each and every so-called suspicious transaction, but is being prevented from doing so by the FIC s refusal to hand over information.Oakbay wants the North Gauteng High Court to order the FIC to give it access to the reports.The company argues that if released, the information will not prejudice any other person as it relates solely to it.The company also questioned why FIC gave the information to Gordhan but refuses to give it to Oakbay.Dudu Dubedudud@thenewage.co.za
