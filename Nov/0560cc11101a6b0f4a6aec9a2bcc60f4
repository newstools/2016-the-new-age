Communications head in hot water after comment about Power FM business anchorANOTHER banking executive is in trouble over a tweet that has been deemed offensive and her employer, Nedbank, says it views the matter in a serious light and is dealing with the issue as a priority.Esm Arendse, Nedbank s head of group communications, tweeted the comment during a brand workshop at a hotel in Sandton.People at the presentation said the comment was directed at author and Power FM radio host Victor Kgomoeswana, who had spoken about banks and their alleged racist tendencies.Kgomoeswana apparently raised Arendse s ire when he said banks didn t entirely understand their clients, especially blacks, because they just sell funeral policies but never encourage savings within that segment of society .Arendse s tweet, which was posted as Kgomoeswana was speaking, read: When ranting and raving lunatic fringe come dressed in a suit masquerading as expertise. And I paid to listen. She deleted the tweet but not before it had been screen-grabbed.Arendse is the second high-level banking executive to be in trouble over controversial tweets. Earlier this year Standard Bank economist Chris Hart resigned after having been suspended for a tweet deemed to be racist.Hart s tweet read: More than 25 years after apartheid ended, the victims are increasing (having a) sense of entitlement and hatred towards minorities. The post drew wide criticism on Twitter and Facebook, with users calling on Standard Bank to fire Hart over the racist undertones in the tweet.Yesterday, Nedbank said the matter was serious and was being addressed. Thulani Sibeko, Nedbank s group executive for marketing communications and corporate affairs, said: The issue you raised, we are already aware of it.We have noted these allegations and view the comments in a very serious light. Nedbank is already investigating the matter. Power 98.7 station manager Mpumelelo Mkhabela said yesterday: We are not aware of the event. We have no comment. Kgomoeswana, who hosts Power Hour, a daily business show, was not available for comment.-SAMUEL MUNGADZE
