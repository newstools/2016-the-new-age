President Jacob Zuma has referred the Financial Intelligence Center(FICA) amendment bill back to Parliament. I have given consideration to the Bill in its entirety and certain submissions regarding the constitutionality of the Bill.After consideration of the Bill and having applied my mind to it, I am of the view that certain provisions of the Bill do not pass constitutional muster.In terms of section 79 (1) of the Constitution I have therefore referred the Bill to the National Assembly for reconsideration for the reasons set out to the Speaker of the National Assembly, the President said in a statement on Tuesday.The FICA bill was passed by Parliament earlier in the year and it has been waiting for the President to sign it into law.Meanwhile, TransformRSA had urged President Zuma not sign the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill into law, saying that the bill was a dangerous piece of legislation for SA s democracy and sovereignty.The bill gives banks the power to perform due diligence tests on politically exposed people (PEPs) as part of their fight against terrorism, money laundering and corruption.However, the President had issues with the current bill because it gave FICA a right to invade a person&#8217;s privacy.&#8220;The President specifically raised concern with the provisions of the Bill relating to warrantless searches, which according to him fall short of the constitutional standard required for the provision not to unjustifiably limit the right to privacy,&#8221; the President said on Tuesday.The President further said he was of the view that even though the purpose to be served by the Bill was very important and pressing, all the provisions of the Bill however must be in line with the Constitution.Other organisations opposed to the Bill include Cosatu, the Black Business Council and the Progressive Professionals Forum.In May, Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini said if the legislation was meant to curb corruption, everyone, including banks, should be subjected to it.The Banking Association of South Africa (Basa), which represents the country s biggest banks, has urged Zuma to pass the bill. We have full faith in the Reserve Bank and we are happy with the Bill. We have to abide by international best practice on money-laundering, MD Cas Coovadia recently said.Another group that supports the Bill, the Council for the Advancement of the Constitution in SA (Casac) , wrote to Zuma in September urging him to sign the bill into law or refer it back to Parliament within 30 days if he had concerns.Casac warned Zuma could face legal action if he did neither.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan told Parliament the amendments were necessary to fight money laundering and financial terrorism.-TNA Reporter
