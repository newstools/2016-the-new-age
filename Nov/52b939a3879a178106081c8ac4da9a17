England have released striker Harry Kane from their squad for Tuesday&#8217;s soccer friendly with Spain, interim manager Gareth Southgate said on Sunday.Southgate said the 23-year-old, who has only just returned from an ankle injury, could return to his club Tottenham Hotspur immediately.Kane was an unused substitute in Friday&#8217;s 3-0 win against Scotland, a World Cup qualifier for which Southgate was keen to have him available.&#8220;Harry reported for us last week having not played a full game for some seven weeks but Tottenham were more than happy for him to come with us,&#8221; Southgate said.&#8220;It was never really my intention to start him in a game and I think it&#8217;s important that he gets a different training programme to what we&#8217;re going to follow over the next couple of days.&#8220;I&#8217;m really grateful to Tottenham for letting us have him for the qualifier.&#8221;Tottenham play West Ham United in the Premier League on Saturday and then travel to Monaco for a Champions League qualifier.-Reuters
