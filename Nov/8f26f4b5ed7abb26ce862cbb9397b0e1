As Mamelodi Sundowns hammered Highlands Park 5-0 at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium yesterday, one Brazilians fan wrote on his poster that Sundowns is so dangerous, only doom can stop us .The fact that Highlands Park suffered the humiliating result at the hands of defending Absa Premiership champions where Percy Tau ran amok, can only mean Gordon Igesund did not bring any Doom .In fact, Igesund conceded during the post-match interview that instead of coaching, he just sat there admiring how exquisitely Sundowns played and how strong their bench looked.Bringing an insecticide, which a local pastor has been claiming conjures miracles, to a match where African Champions were simply in the mood could have never worked.This is because Pitso Mosimane s men went for the jugular as early as the first minute.The intention to make it rain goals was made absolutely clear when Tau dispossessed Augustine Mbara, running with the ball from close to the halfway line until he fired a grass-cutter that beat Tapuwa Kapini to make it 1-0.Highlands struggled to get into the game and that saw Kapini pick up the ball from his own net some six minutes later when Thapelo Morena made a brilliant run, laying a pass to an advancing Anthony Laffor, who fired home to make it 2-0.It became all Sundowns from then on and Tau, who walked away with his third successive man of the match award, found Sibusiso Vilakazi unmarked in the 29th minute, helping him fire another grass-cutter to increase the lead to 3-0.Tau got his second assist of the day when he started a counter-attacking move and found Themba Zwane who slotted in a fourth for Sundowns, giving Mosimane s side a comfortable 4-0 half-time lead.More of the same came from Tau in the second half, and this time, the midfielder forced Rudi Isaacs to put one in the back of his own net in the 56th minute.The goal completed the Brazilians rout.The win was Sundowns fourth in a row and lifted them to eighth on the log with 13 points from six league matches.They next travel to Cape Town Stadium to face Ajax Cape Town on Wednesday night.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANEmmasekepem@thenewage.co.za&nbsp;
