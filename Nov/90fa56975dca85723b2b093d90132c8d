Convicted drug dealer Radovan Krejcir and four others are expected to appear in the High Court in Johannesburg on Thursday.Krejcir faces nine charges along with co-accused Bulgarian Lybohir Grigorov, Mfaniseni Memela, Nkanyiso Mafunda, and Siboniso Miya.They allegedly shot and killed Lebanese national Sam Issa near his home in Bedfordview in October 2013.The State alleges Issa was killed because he and Krejcir argued about R500 000 Issa had lent Krejcir for a bail application in another case.Krejcir claims his mother had sent him bail money and that Issa owed him R500 000.On Monday, an alleged member of convicted drug dealer Radovan Krejcir s gang, Thabiso Ledwaba, and three other suspects appeared in the Randburg Magistrate s Court for possession of an unlicensed firearm and live ammunition, a hijacked vehicle and police equipment.Ledwaba has been on the run since March after escaping from the Palm Ridge Magistrate s Court while awaiting sentencing for a string of charges. A reward of R100000 was offered by the Hawks for information leading to his whereabouts.Ledwaba and three other suspects were apprehended on Friday when two Johannesburg metro police officers spotted a grey BMW 3 Series at the Core Shopping Centre, Sunninghill.-TNA Reporter
