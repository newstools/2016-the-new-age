The anti-corruption protest had barely begun when it was brought to an abrupt end, baton-wielding police firing volleys of tear gas and charging at a group of hundreds gathered in Nairobi&#8217;s centre.Thursday&#8217;s police action was as predictable as it was effective, quickly scattering the protesters, many of them wearing red T-shirts with the slogan &#8220;Act On Corruption Now Or Resign&#8221;.The message was aimed at President Uhuru Kenyatta who last month blamed others for runaway corruption saying he had done all he could to rein it in.&#8220;What does he mean there&#8217;s nothing he can do? It irritates me when he talks like that,&#8221; said a 30-year-old protester who, instead of giving her name, gave her Twitter handle, Mpalelo. &#8220;He can fire people! He can hold people to account!&#8221;Before the tear gas billowed across Nairobi&#8217;s Freedom Corner, the protest organisers had addressed around 300 people from the top of a memorial to Kenya&#8217;s Mau Mau fighters, who battled British colonial authorities in the run-up to independence.They sang songs, blew whistles, held placards reading &#8220;Jail The Corrupt&#8221; and &#8220;Pay Back The Money&#8221;, and listened to speeches.The latest in a series of scandals to hit the government involves alleged theft from the health ministry. For Bernard Baridi, a 27-year old student, that was the final straw.&#8220;When you attack health you attack the heart of every citizen. Innocent lives are lost every day because of lack of medicine, facilities. It is something we cannot allow,&#8221; he said.Among the protesters many said they were there to support the president, not defy him.&#8220;We gave him the mandate, the power, to fight corruption,&#8221; said Martin Kavaya, a 39-year-old who runs a programme for unemployed youth in Nairobi. &#8220;We are not against him, we are here to give him the power to act, to let those people be prosecuted.&#8221;&#8220;Whatever we are doing, we are trying to support him in a different from,&#8221; Kavaya said.Soon after, as the police moved in and the crowd was driven away, it was clear their support was not wanted.&nbsp;-AFP
