After the defeat to South Africa this weekend, Senegalese coach, former player and captain of the national team Aliou Ciss said finding balance is difficult.He said getting the balance is continuous, unlike in the case of South Africa who have more players based locally. Between 2015 and 2016 many things have happened, players will come and go, I have to select a lot of different players to make a solid group, he said before the two teams clashed in Polokwane.The man, who captained the National team that reached the quarter finals of the 2002 World Cup in South Korea, will need his attacking players to have a big part to play in the team, regardless of the chopping and changing in the team.Mame Birame Diouf, who played for Manchester United and now plays for Stoke City, Lazio forward Kieta Balde and the ever impressive Sadio Mane who is banging in the goals at Anfield is the talisman for the team.Mane, who has scored 6 goals in the 10 English premiership appearances for Liverpool, is the player that holds the hopes of the Senegalese national team on their way to Russia.The team had won their opener against Cape Verde at home, playing at the Stade Leopold Sedar Senghor stadium, Dakar. Goals from Keita Balde and Moussa Sow helped to a cosy two goal win.But Cissie said that it&#8217;s not only the front line that has ammunition: we don t only score goals with our strikers, many players score. Their next game will be against Burkino Faso at Home on November 28 .TNA Reporter
