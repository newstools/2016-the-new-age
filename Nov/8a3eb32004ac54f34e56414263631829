Desiree Ellis will attempt to lead Banyana Banyana to their first Africa Women s Cup of Nations title in Cameroon from Saturday, something she failed to achieve as a player twice in the past. Ellis was named caretaker coach after Safa decided not to renew Vera Pauw s contract after the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Ellis failed to win the championship in 1995 and in 2000 as captain when they finished as runners up. Now she will be at the helm of Banyana in Cameroon starting on Saturday against Zimbabwe. We ve been runners up four times, I was runner up as a player and it will be fantastic if we can finally win it, Ellis said. We know it s not going to be easy, but we will go there with the mind set that we can do it. We will go with the mind set that we believe. When we played Equatorial Guinea in the final match of the Olympics qualifier, we drew at home and I know many people didn t give us a chance, but we had so much belief that no matter what they threw at us in a stadium full of their supporters we had that belief and we won. Having to prepare differently now as a coach compared to her days as a player, the 53 year old said she knows what is expected to win the tournament and what it will mean for her and the nation. The feeling is still the same, I am excited and nervous, but the work is a million times more. When you are done with your coaching, there is nothing more you can do when the players take to the field. We sit on the bench and we have to trust them on the field because they are all capable of doing the job. I think it will be fantastic to win it as a coach and it will be great for the sponsors and Safa if we bring this title home for the support that they have given this team. Ellis will also hope that in form striker Thembi Kgatlana carries her form into the continental competition.nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
