Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman is facing eight weeks on the sidelines after injuring his knee and ankle while training with France this week.&#8220;Coman will be out for two months,&#8221; Bayern said in a statement on Friday after the 20-year-old suffered a torn capsule in his left ankle and torn ligaments in his knee.He was injured while preparing for France&#8217;s World Cup qualifier against Sweden on Friday.There was some good news, though, for Bundesliga leaders Bayern who are chasing a record-extending fifth consecutive title.Spain defender Javi Martinez has made a quicker recovery than expected and is set to return to training next week following the adductor muscle injury he sustained early last month.&#8220;It is even possible he will be at the disposal of coach Carlo Ancelotti for the match at (Borussia) Dortmund on Nov. 19,&#8221; Bayern said.The Bavarians lead the Bundesliga on goal difference from promoted RB Leipzig after 10 games.Bayern have also secured a spot in the Champions League knockout stage with two group matches to spare.&#8211;Reuters
