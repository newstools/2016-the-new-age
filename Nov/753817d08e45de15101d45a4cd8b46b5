Forum of Journalists founder Piet Rampedi has on Wednesday accused the Citizen newspaper of being basstein of media racism, inequality, exploitation and institutional culture of racism perpetuated against black journalists.Rampedi&#8217;s utterance&#8217;s follows the news of the suspension of the Citizens Editor Stephen Motale last week. Motale was suspended because of the alleged personal vendetta he has against former Finance minister Trevor Manuel.Motale&#8217;s suspension comes after the paper ran a series of articles about the Hawks investigation into the then finance minister&#8217;s role into the irregular awarding of SARS tenders, and when He (Manuel) was called to give his side of the story he responded in a nasty manner towards the journalists who called him.In responses to Motale&#8217;s investigation into the matter the company&#8217;s executive directors ordered the publisher to offer Motale a golden handshake to leave because his services were no longer needed , but reports stated that he refused the handshake saying that he wont be bought to keep quiet about these un-savoury developments.Meanwhile,Rampedi said Forum of Journalist will reaffirm the rights of black journalist to exist and also be able to practice their craft without fear, favour or prejudice. We are not being done a favour for being journalists, we went to school like other white journalist and we refuse to be treated like we&#8217;ve been done a favour he said.Rampedi said it was time for owners of media houses like Citizens to acknowledge black journalist and start treating them fair. The main thing we want to highlight to the public is that they must know that media transformation is a myth and that the editorial interference is riffle especially in the privately owned organisation, Rampedi said.Rampedi also alluded that media houses like ENCA, Radio 702, media24 editorial interference were riffled there, but all the big companies deviate attention to media house like the South African Broadcasting Authority (SABC).He made an example of media houses who were suppose to be competitors,but chose to collude to push certain narrative. I tell you if you come from outside the country and pick up all the publication, one would think they all managed by one editor in chief, Rampedi said.In addition an organiser of forum of Journalist Rampedi said that the main agenda of this owners is to defend and perpetuated the socio economic and political status quo of the country. He further said the media owners who are currently owning 80% of media that their interest are defended, their socio political interest are defended.He further reiterated that the job of the media in the country was to publish stories without fear, favour and prejudice irrespective of social standing, Rampedi also took a swipe on SANEF accusing the organisation of failing to defend the suspended Citizen editor Stephen Motale, because of his wrong skin colour and that he didn t think like the editor and leadership of SANEF.The Forum of Journalists is scheduled to march at the citizens office, and Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and Black First Land First (BLF) organisation and hand over a memorandum of understanding to the Citizen.-Sipho Jack
