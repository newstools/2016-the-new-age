Despite the leak of the Grade 12 mathematics question paper two at Giyani High School and surrounding areas, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga and provincial education MEC Ishmael Kgatjepe remained confident that examinations would run smoothly until the last day.Motshekga appealed to Grade 12 pupils to focus on their examinations and not to be distracted by negative news about irregularities. This examination is your gateway to your future. As a department we will not rest if this vital national asset is tampered with, Motshekga said.She said a ministerial investigation team had been established to probe how pupils in Giyani had access to the mathematics examination questions before the exam last week.She, however, disclosed that preliminary investigations revealed that the paper was leaked by a former Giyani High School pupil who was now based in Gauteng.The source of the leak had already come forward to confess and other pupils were doing the same, Motshekga said. The minister said the ministerial investigation team, which will work closely with officials in the provincial education department, would report to her on the findings within six weeks. The paper, which was not in the same format as the final examination, was shared among pupils via WhatsApp.Sources said the unusual excitement displayed by a group of pupils at Giyani High School after writing mathematics question paper one caused invigilators to suspect foul play. Cheating and other irregularities in Grade 12 examinations could lead to imprisonment or banishment from studies, the department warned.The Grade 12 examinations taking place in 1699 centres across Limpopo are scheduled to end on November 29.Montsho Matlalamontshom@thenewage.co.za
