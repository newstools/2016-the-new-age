PROVINCIAL treasury head Simiso Magagula urged government employees to exercise caution when they spend their money over the festive season.He was addressing employees attending the office of the premier s financial education summit at the Chief Albert Luthuli Central hospital in Durban.Magagula said whenever they spend money over the Christmas holidays, they should remember January, which is only a few days away.He said people had a tendency to splash all their hard-earned bonuses over the holidays, only to be confronted by debt in January when they start the new year.The summit was part of the treasury s ongoing campaign to get government employees to clamp down on runaway spending habits and inculcate a culture of saving with their personal income. We want you to live on a budget. Make budgeting a family affair, Magagula said. Know that your income equals expenditure. Moderate your spending.If you can t postpone your desires, you have a problem because you will slide into debt. He also advised government employees to save their money in reputable financial institutions like banks and avoid pyramid schemes. Many government employees who have financial challenges have resorted into resigning to cash in their pension money. This is not a good decision. That is why we emphasise that people must save for a rainy day, Magagula said.Mzwandile Gumede from the premier s office, said the government would continue organising similar financial education summits to ensure that government employees were financially literate.He asked employees to make use of their employees wellness units in their departments.The National Credit Regulator s Zonke Majola said there were a lot of people, including government employees, who were in debt because they did not handle their finances well.nokuthulan@thenewage.co.zaNOKUTHULA NTULI
