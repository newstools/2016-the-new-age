Sunderland manager David Moyes is hoping his willingness to give youngsters a chance in his first team will attract some of the finest young talents in the game to the Premier League club&#8217;s academy.In a bid to inject energy into his ageing squad, Moyes has fielded 10 under-23 players in his first-team this season, including defenders Paddy McNair, Donald Love and Jason Denayer, and midfielders Didier Ndong and Adnan Januzaj.&#8220;Everton had an academy which produced young players, Manchester United had an academy which produced young players, and Sunderland have an academy which has produced,&#8221; Moyes told British media, referring to his previous two English clubs.Sunderland&#8217;s academy have produced several Premier League players in recent years, including goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, winger Duncan Watmore and midfielder Lynden Gooch as well as Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson.&#8220;I want it to inspire young players to think, &#8216;If I go to Sunderland, the manager might put me in the team there. Maybe it&#8217;s better than going to one of the big clubs where maybe the manager won&#8217;t put me in the team.&#8217;,&#8221; Moyes added.&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to use that as a motivation to the parents and the young players out there to say, &#8216;Come to Sunderland&#8217;.&#8221;Sunderland, who are bottom of the league, will look to pick up back-to-back wins for the first time this season when they host third-bottom Hull City on Saturday.&#8211;Reuters
