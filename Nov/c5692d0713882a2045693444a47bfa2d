Nederburg, the exclusive premium wine partner of Team Dimension Data for Qhubeka, is working with the non-profit organisation to establish a bicycle assembly facility in the Western Cape, endorsed by the provincial government.The facility was launched at a recent event held at Nederburg in Paarl.MEC for economic opportunities Alan Winde told the audience at the event of the province s commitment to cycling as a sport to play its part in stimulating economic growth in the region.The Team Dimension Data for Qhubeka pro-cycling team, affectionately known as Africa s Team , pedal for a worthy cause.They raise funds and awareness for Qhubeka (which means to progress ), the organisation that mobilises for socio-economic progress by distributing bicycles to needy South Africans in exchange for work done to improve the environment, community or academic results.Bikes allow riders to carry more books, more goods for sale and more medicines and other supplies they can distribute among communities.Since its inception in 2005, Qhubeka has distributed bicycles to more than 70000 deserving South Africans.Qhubeka has an existing bicycle assembly facility located in the North West. The facility at the Nederburg winery in Paarl is the first in the Western Cape and is expected to be in full operation by early February.Eight women from the Paarl East community, which surrounds Nederburg, will be selected to work in and manage the facility.They will receive full training in assembling bicycles.The majority of the bicycle parts, complying with Qhubeka s specifications, are all of the highest quality and imported from the US and Asia, with some components made by manufacturers in South Africa.The facility at Nederburg will have the capacity to assemble a minimum of 5000 purpose-built bicycles each year.The women employed at the facility will each receive a bicycle, to give them freedom to travel, and they will also be financially remunerated.D -Mari Shaw, Nederburg s global general manager, said: The aim is to give back to communities as an investment in the future in much the same way as Nederburg, in its own capacity, is bringing skills to South African winegrowers and wine makers. We believe Nederburg is a South African brand that reflects the new dynamism of the country s wine industry, considered one of the most exciting New World wine-producing countries by opinion leaders in the UK and the US. The establishment of the bicycle facility at Nederburg forms an integral part of our commitment to continue building the future of the South African wine industry and its communities. Nederburg also pledges to sponsor a minimum of 345 bicycles over the next year.The beneficiaries will include those from Paarl East s social development initiative, as well as projects such as the Wildlands Conservation Trust programme and the Vision Afrika woodwork project. With so many lives to be changed, we encourage individuals to engage and participate in helping to make a difference to South African lives. Nederburg will be sharing the stories of those who benefit from receiving their new bicycles, Shaw said.TNA Reporterprovinces@thenewage.co.za
