The move by the Department of Correctional Sservices to transfer Oscar Pistorius to Atteridgeville Correctional Centre, under the Kgosi Mampuru II Management Area, has been criticised by the South African Prisoners Organisation for Human Rights (SAPOHR). The Atteridgeville Correctional Centre accommodates offenders sentenced for 0-6 years and has rehabilitation and development programmes in place for offenders. It was after very careful consideration of all important factors, that the management decided that Atteridgeville Correctional Centre was the best place to accommodate Pistorius, said Department of Correctional Services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo.The department said since his incarceration, Pistorius had to be placed at the Remand Detention Centre which is used to accommodate awaiting trial and sentenced offenders who need full-time hospitalisation or healthcare. This was done in order to accommodate his disability needs. The Remand Detention Centre does not have rehabilitation and development programmes as it is strictly designed for remand detainees, said Nxumalo. SAPOHR spokesperson Golden Miles Bhudu called the move white supremacy . The department is bending under severe pressure from Pistorius s legal team. This is clearly preferential treatment towards a cold-blooded murderer who killed an innocent person, Bhudu said. He said that deserving offenders are neglected in order to allow for preferential treatment and that he would like to have his organisation inspect the facility.news@thenewage.co.za
