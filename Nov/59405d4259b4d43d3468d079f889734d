THE Communication Workers Union (CWU) has accused SA Post Office CEO Mark Barnes of double-speak by offering voluntary severance packages as a ploy to reduce the workforce.Briefing journalists in Johannesburg yesterday, CWU president Clyde Mervin accused Barnes of reneging on his word since he joined the state-owned entity. He said the union was aware that Sapo was intending to lay off workers. The post office recently offered workers voluntary severance packages. About 850 workers have left the system and they are saying that is not enough, they want to trim the post office. When Mark Barnes joined the post office he told the government that I am not here to retrench workers . What we are seeing now is a different tune, giving workers voluntary severance packages amounts to retrenchments. Mervin vowed to throw a spanner in the works of Sapo s plans to trim staff in an effort to cut costs. We are told that there will be engagements around retrenchments and we will challenge that. Presently there s an issue of post bank. We said that it should be a people s bank, but business people have a different interest, which also creates problems, he said.CWU general secretary Aubrey Tshabalala said the union was mulling a decision to strike at Telkom. This after the union in September decided to suspend its industrial action after union members went on strike for more than a month. We need to emphasise that since the day of the strike suspension there has been an onslaught on workers and the union. We are promising Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko and chairperson of the board of directors of Telkom Jabulane Mabuza that the CWU is now at the final stage review of our decision to suspend the strike. In various regions, we have gathered a mandate to go back on strike. Our national executive committee will convene at the end of the month to resolve on a date. -Bonolo Selebano
