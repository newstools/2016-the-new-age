I thank all those who voted for us, particularly for the two awards best gospel artist and best gospel song. This proves that original songs are appreciated as the album has been one of the fastest selling albums, Dr Tumi said.The former medical doctor who has been praised for injecting a new life in the gospel industry through original compositions also encouraged his peers to write their own songs or get others to write for them. It is not right that gospel artists relay on recycled music. That is being lazy. Contrary to popular belief, we have proven that original music can actually sell and win you awards. It is indeed an honour and an amazing feeling to witness God at work, Dr Tumi said.Mthethwa took to Twitter to appreciate his: Thank you for supporting me and always buying The music we produce!!
