Chippa United coach Dan Malesela feels the Fifa international break was what they needed to sort out their problems. The Chilli Boys have not registered a win in their last five matches despite their promising start to the season.The last time they recorded a victory was on September 28 when they defeated Baroka FC 4-1 in the league and since then they lost to Golden Arrows and drew against Bloemfontein Celtic as well as Platinum Stars before losing 1-0 to Bidvest Wits. Following that poor run, they have dropped down to eighth on the Absa Premiership log standings after two victories, three draws and two losses.And Malesela is planning to get them back to winning ways when they host in form Cape Town City at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday. The Fifa break gave us an opportunity to go back to the training ground and find solutions, Malesela said. We are fully focused on the next challenge. We need to knuckle down and show the hunger to win games again. We lacked a bit of effort against Bidvest Wits and at the end that was the difference between ourselves and them. We have a responsibility to defend the Chippa United emblem and take this project to greater heights.We have reminded the players of their bit on the field of play. Malesela is aware that it won t be easy against a highly confident Cape Town City, a side who ve registered two successive victories. We are playing at home and our objective when we take the field is to win and it will not be different on Saturday. nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
