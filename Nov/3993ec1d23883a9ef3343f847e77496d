The African National Congress Youth League(ANCYL) on Tuesday said the national minimum wage should be R5000 and has called on all stakeholders to reconsider the current wage proposal.The comments of the Youth League come days after Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa announced recommendations made by the panel of experts tasked with setting the amount for the wage at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac), that the minimum wage would be R3 500 per month a figure which has polarised opinion since it was announced.The ANCYL while saying it appreciates the move towards consensus on the principle of a minimum wage across the country, they are unhappy with the amount currently on the table and more research should be conducted before committing to the R3 500 figure.&#8220;We wish to advise stakeholders to first conduct a study of living conditions and expenses of the least paid workers rather then looking at what employers say can pay workers,&#8221; said League spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize in a statement.&#8220;The most affected here are general workers, domestic workers, security guards and cleaners. These sectors are highly populated by the youth who some of them are parents, heads of households and look after many dependants,&#8221; continued Mkhize.Meanwhile the proposed figure has received mixed reactions across South African Society.In contrast to the Youth league, the ANC welcomed the announcement. We believe this goes a long way to giving effect to the electoral mandate to the ANC government to introduce a national minimum wage. The panel s report provides a clear way forward for the conclusion of a social compact between social partners under the guidance of Nedlac.&#8221;Parliament s labour portfolio committee has also welcomed the announcement.Portfolio committee chairperson Lumka Yengeni said as an entry-level this amount would save the most vulnerable workers from further exploitation.However, the Gauteng chapter of the Young Communist League of South Africa (YCLSA) described the proposal as an insult and urged the ANC to withdraw its support.The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said: The NUM is not in a position to accept or reject the national minimum wage proposal. The NUM will pronounce its decision later this week. Trade Federation Cosatu will be discussing the minimum wage proposal at its CEC meeting which kicked off on Monday.-TNA Reporter
