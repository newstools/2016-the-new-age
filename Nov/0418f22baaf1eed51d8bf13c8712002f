MISS South Africa Ntandoyenkosi Kunene is ready to make the nation proud at the Miss World pageant in Washington DC on December 20.Yesterday, the Mpumalanga-born beauty hosted a star-studded farewell party at the Maslow Hotel in Sandton.The 23-year-old thanked all those who rallied behind her for the duration of her reign as Miss SA. Being Miss SA has always been a dream of mine but never did I imagine that I would be going to the Miss World contest, she said.The qualified teacher said she was comforted by her body of work which she claimed had reached millions of children as well as the ability to impart her knowledge in any way possible to young people across the country. For me teaching is not only about being in class physically but through my work and the motivational talks that I give. I want to leave a footprint that other aspiring Miss SA winners can follow, especially for the young girls who are trying to follow their dreams, she said.Kunene subsequently unveiled her traditional gown that she will be showcasing on the Miss World stage. It is designed by JJ Schoeman. Kunene will be jetting off to the US on November 25 for a three-week long preparation.-NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
