Damian Lillard kicked off the season with a 39-point night and eight games into the campaign he isn&#8217;t showing any signs of slowing down.When the smoke cleared on Tuesday night, backcourt teammates Lillard and CJ McCollum carried the Portland Trail Blazers to a 124-121 victory over the Phoenix Suns at the Moda Center.Lillard scored 22 of his 38 points in the fourth quarter while McCollum had 18 of his 33 points in the first quarter for the Trail Blazers, who improved to 5-3 and won their third straight game.&#8220;Dame was clutch,&#8221; Portland coach Terry Stotts said. &#8220;He made his free throws. We were struggling without him. Seemed like he made every big play he had to.&#8221;Lillard was five of nine from the field, two of four from three-point range and 10 of 10 from the free-throw line over the final 12 minutes.&#8220;Once it got to that point, players got to play,&#8221; Lillard said. &#8220;You have to just get it done. That&#8217;s what I did.&#8221;Portland also got 20 points from Moe Harkless, who also grabbed six rebounds.Eric Bledsoe scored 17 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter and Devin Booker tallied 23 for the Suns.The Suns erased an 18-point first-quarter deficit and tied the game at 93-93 with just under eight minutes remaining. Lillard scored 20 of his 22 fourth-quarter points after that.McCollum had a hot hand from the beginning as Portland surged to a 33-15 lead on 14-for-15 shooting in the game&#8217;s first seven minutes.McCollum made all seven shots, including three from three-point range, and had scored 18 points at that point. The Blazers wound up with a 42-25 lead after one quarter.&#8220;You see a guy going like that, it&#8217;s my job to feed him,&#8221; Lillard said. &#8220;He had a big first quarter. We rode that out and, as he cooled off, that&#8217;s when I started to get more aggressive and find my way.&#8221;Bledsoe was smoking in the fourth quarter, sinking five of seven from the field and six of seven from the line as the Suns hung in there.&#8220;We never give up,&#8221; Booker said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good team over there. Every time we play (the Blazers), it&#8217;s going to be a war. They got the edge tonight, but next time we&#8217;re going to be ready.&#8221;&#8211;AFP
