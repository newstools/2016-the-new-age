Klate is the most decorated fooballer with 13 major trophies five League titles and eight cups, the most recent being the MTN8 cup title when they defeated Mamelodi Sundowns 3-0 at the Mbombela Stadium.The 31-year-old said that it was a bit disappointing to miss the world cup in 2010 after being left out of the squad even if he was player of the season.The player does however say that he is happy that he is getting Bafana call ups at a time where his two sons can realise the importance of playing for the national side.&#8220;The only start I got in the team was in 2005 when Stuart Baxter was still the coach,&#8221; he said.&#8220;Obviously I have to take things in my stride. The past is the past I just need to move on with the future and for the good of the country,&#8221; added Klate.The Port Elizabeth born said he has never worked with coach shakes Mashaba in a camp situation, so it&#8217;s going to be the first time for him. He said he wants to go there and grasp what Mashaba wants him to do, to follow his instructions.&#8220;If you look at their players it brings to mind, Sadio Mane at Liverpool, he is absolutely on fire in the premier league, so its going to be a very difficult task. But I think we have a weekend of preparations. we have to go there play with the right desire play with the right attitude,&#8221; said Klate.
