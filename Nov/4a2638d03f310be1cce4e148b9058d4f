Amazulu coach Joey Antipas s future is in doubt after his side suffered a 2-0 loss to National First Division rookies Real Kings at the Sugar Ray Xulu stadium in Durban at the weekend. The KZN derby had plenty of drama, with the hosts seeing Sbonelo Khubone receive his marching orders, while AmaZulu also had the duo of Sibusiso Magaqa and Lungelo Dlamini sent off to take early showers.However, the fans who braved the rain were treated to some fine goals. Kings piled pressure on Usuthu and were rewarded when midfielder Philani Gumede headed home, while defender Sello Motsepe turned the ball into the net in the dying minutes of the game. The defeat, the fifth under Antipas, sees Usuthu drop to eighth spot with 13 points while Kings moved up to seventh place with 14 points from 10 games.The Usuthu management are rumoured to have approached NFD specialist Serbian Heric Vladislav with the view of taking over after the powers that be have got rid of the Zimbabwean coach who started his spell well enough but fell victim to three straight losses last month. The fans were angry after one of the recent defeats, a 1-0 loss to Witbank Spurs; they took out their frustrations on team manager Japhet Zwane, with the police having to intervene.Meanwhile, Thanda Royal Zulu extended their lead at the top of standings after their seventh victory out of 10 matches. They were ahead through a 20th minute penalty and stretched the lead after the break, before Pogiso Mahlangu pulled a goal back.
