It seems like Luvhengo Mungomeni will have to put in extra effort to impress Gordon Igesund if he is to earn a contract with Highlands Park. Igesund gave the 31 year-old right back a chance to prove he could be an asset to the PSL rookies when he fielded him in the Gauteng Champion of Champions tournament on Sunday at Tsakane Stadium.Mungomeni s performance at the tournament was not enough for Igesund to decide if he will bring the former Mamelodi Sundowns defender on board. The coach is planning to give Mungomeni, who has been without a club since parting ways with Moroka Swallows at the end of last season, more time to prove himself. I still have to look at him, he is down there and I am going to have a good look at him and then decide whether I sign him or not. Right now there is nothing, Igesund said.The two have worked together before when Igesund was the coach of Moroka Swallows four years ago. During Igesund s tenure at Swallows, Mungomeni was one of the regular players in the starting lineup and captained the team in the absence of Lefa Tsutsulupa.Mungomeni is not the only player who was given the chance to impress Igesund during the tournament as it was the same for a host of fringe players. It was a good platform to give fringe players a chance and I did that, Igesund said. There was no player in the squad who played in our last competitive match. I needed to see who can make it to the senior team, who can stand out for me and who can really go the distance with me and it gave me a good idea going forward and to see whether they are ready to play in this team. sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
