Unless the public assists the police to bring the perpetrators to book, this type of sabotage will continue to impact the lives of hard working breadwinners adversely,&#8221; said Walker.The operator has provided Golden Arrow bus services which operate between Plumstead and Cape Town, with also a supplementary Prasa bus shuttle.Metrorail advised commuters disembarking Pinelands/ Ndabeni to travel through to Cape Town where there will be a mutual shuttle service.Walker stated that the rationale behind the shuttle concept ensures reliability. It allows us to run trains at regular frequencies; albeit fewer trains than our normal schedule but has the advantage of providing greater predictability and reliability for commuters,&#8221; said Walker in a statement.On Monday, train delays were experienced in some lines of up to 4 hours.-KEITUMETSI MOTLHALE
