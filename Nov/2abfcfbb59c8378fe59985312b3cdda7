Banyana Banyana may have made things difficult for themselves in their quest to lift the Women s Africa Cup of Nations title in Cameroon.Following their goalless draw against Zimbabwe on Saturday, Banyana face a must-win-encounter against host Cameroon tomorrow in their second match in Group A.Cameroon defeated Egypt 2-0 in the opening match and are log leaders with three points after one match.The South Africans, who dominated the match but failed to score a goal, will need to beat Cameroon to keep their hopes of making the semifinal and final alive.But that won t be easy considering the fact that Cameroon will be playing in front of a partisan crowd with the stadium expected to be full to capacity again.However, Banyana have been in that situation before when they defeated Equatorial Guinea in their 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics qualifier in October last year.They played the return leg away in front of an almost sold out stadium and came out tops, winning that match and qualifying for the Olympics.Now they need to do that against host Cameroon as a defeat and a Zimbabwe or Egypt victory will see their chances of making progress in the group stages evaporate.Interim coach Desiree Ellis admitted that the squad need to work on their finishing ahead of their second match tomorrow. All we can do is keep working hard. We tried our best but the goals just didn t come our way. We could have played another 20 minutes and still not managed to get the ball in the back of the net, Ellis said. We will keep on working hard and hopefully things will change in our next match. Thembi Kgatlana, who scored a brace in Banyana s 3-0 beating of Zimbabwe in the friendly match before the tournament, missed countless chances. She will hope for an improved performance tomorrow in Yaounde.Banyana enjoyed good preparations as they defeated both Zimbabwe and Egypt 3-0 and 3-1 in their friendly matches, but struggled to convert one of the many chances they created on Saturday.They will need to improve on that if they hope to get the better of Cameroon.Neville Khozanevillek@thenewage.co.za
