He was welcomed with boos from the packed Adelaide Oval crowd with South Africa struggling on 44/3 but left to applause after a dazzling unbeaten century and an incredible act of cunning captaincy that denied David Warner to open the batting.In a stroke of genius, Du Plessis surprised everyone when he declared South Africa s day one first innings on a competitive 259/9 to deny Warner, who had just returned to the field after treatment, the opportunity to open the batting for the Aussies.Warner was ruled ineligible to bat for Australia for the opening six minutes of the home team s innings because of his time off the field.Du Plessis, who scored 118, admitted after the match that he thought about setting the trap when he overheard Australian captain Steve Smith register his concern about Warner s availability with umpires Richard Kettleborough and Nigel Llong. I was aware of it, Du Plessis said afterwards. I saw them speaking to the umpire and I put my ear a little closer towards them and as soon as I heard that he was in trouble with the time I ran off. Du Plessis quick thinking and innovation was hailed worldwide with Australian Test legend Shane Warne showering praises and saying it was another big tick for his captaincy. I reckon he has worked that out. He knew that David Warner stayed off the field for too long and he has declared at 9/259 than try to eke out some extra runs. Australia have missed a trick and South Africa are right on the ball. Aussie quick Josh Hazlewood said after the day s play that he expected Warner to apologise to his teammates over the incident. The guys were a little bit annoyed, especially Smith and probably Usman Khawaja who had to go out and bat. He went off for some treatment towards the end and was off for obviously too long and that messed the timings up so he couldn t bat straight away. Khawaja and Matt Renshaw resumed this morning with Australia on 14/0 and trailing by 245 runs&#8211;MAHLATSE MPHAHLELE
