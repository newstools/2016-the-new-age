The scary thing about Kagiso KG Rabada is that he is going to get better.At just 21, he has a minimum of 10 years of international cricket ahead of him in which he could establish himself as a global superstar.Rabada led the Proteas to a convincing 177-run victory over Australia at the Waca Ground in Perth yesterday with almost a full session to spare to give South Africa a 1-0 lead in the threematch Test series.Following his match-winning heroics, Rabada also achieved something of a rarity by winning over the usually hostile former Australia players.Pundits such as Shane Warne, Michael Clarke and Mark Taylor could not hide their admiration for Rabada after he claimed his fourth five-wicket haul of the year as the Proteas recorded their third successive Test victory in Perth over their rivals.Ian Healy, who said Rabada produced the best bowling he had ever seen , went on to compare the South African to legendary Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram, known as the King of Swing.The defeat was Australia s first home Test defeat since the Waca match against the Proteas in 2012 and their fourth loss in a row following the 3-0 series loss in Sri Lanka. The result puts Australia under plenty of pressure heading into Saturday s second Test at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, Tasmania.Rabada has taken 34 wickets in six matches this year, one of which was the weather-ruined game against New Zealand in Durban.He is now in seventh place of the world s leading wicket-takers this year and has played fewer matches than anybody else. His dismissal of Australian captain Steve Smith in the second innings was only the 100th wicket of his first-class career.Reflecting on the victory, Proteas stand-in captain Faf du Plessis described it as the best Test match of my career and heaped praise on Rabada. I am incredibly proud of him, Du Plessis said. I have a lot of respect for anyone who puts up their hand and does the hard yards. He just wanted the ball. Every time I asked him if he was tired or done, he said: No, you re not taking the ball out of my hand. That is a sign of a champion bowler for me someone who wants to be in the fight the whole time.
