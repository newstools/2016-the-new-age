Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Monday made an Election Eve show of political force at a massive rally in Philadelphia &#8212; with her president husband Bill, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle at her side.Clinton urged the roughly 40,000 people gathered near Independence Hall &#8212; where the Founding Fathers adopted both the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution &#8212; to reject her &#8220;loose cannon&#8221; opponent Donald Trump.&#8220;There is a clear choice in this election, a choice between division or unity,&#8221; Clinton, 69, told the rally.&#8220;Between an economy that works for everyone or only those at the top, between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk.&#8220;Make no mistake, our core values are being tested in this election,&#8221; she said, delivering her campaign pledge to be a president for all Americans.&#8220;Tomorrow, we face the test of our time.&#8221;Clinton took the stage after Obama, who galvanized the crowd by explaining how his former secretary of state was uniquely placed to succeed her as the nation&#8217;s commander-in-chief.&#8220;You have bet on me. I was always grateful for that. I always had the better odds, because I always got to bet on you,&#8221; Obama said.&#8220;I am betting that, tomorrow, you will reject fear and choose hope,&#8221; he added.&#8220;I&#8217;m betting that the wisdom and decency and generosity of the American people will once again win the day and that is a bet that I have never, ever lost.&#8221;Clinton was headed to Raleigh, North Carolina for the final stop in her marathon last day of campaigning, while her Republican rival &#8212; whose New Hampshire rally unfolded while she was on stage in Philadelphia &#8212; was headed to Michigan.The Democrat has had a narrow but consistent lead in opinion polls as she strives to become America&#8217;s first woman president, but her battle with the 70-year-old Manhattan billionaire has tightened in recent days.And the campaign has been bruising &#8212; she has been dogged by allegations that she put US secrets at risk on her private email server while at the State Department and the race remains perilously close in a handful of key states.Support for Trump dropped after footage emerged of him bragging about sexual assault and at least a dozen women came forward to accuse him, but polls have grown closer as the big day approaches.Rock legend Bruce Springsteen warmed up the crowd, hailing Clinton for her &#8220;vision of an America where everyone counts.&#8221;-AFP
