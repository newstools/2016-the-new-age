Kopanong local municipality in the Free State has failed to implement recommendations from the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), following an investigation which found it violated residents rights by failing to provide access to sufficient water fit for human consumption.The revelation was made by the provincial manager of the SAHRC Free State Office, Buang Jones, who confirmed to The New Age that the municipality had not adhered to the commission s recommendations .The New Age made several attempts over more than a week to get a response from the municipality s spokesperson. A response was promised by midday last Friday but failed to materialise.Jones said an inspection conducted in April 2016 to determine the municipality s compliance with recommendations revealed that much still needs to be done since 2014.The SAHRC recommendations come from a complaint the DA provincial leader, Patricia Kopane, brought to the commission in 2012 on behalf of residents of Frayville, Ipopeng, Fauresmith and Jagersfontein which fall under the jurisdiction of the Kopanong local municipality.She claimed the municipality had failed, among other things, to provide residents with an adequate basic water supply, provide residents with access to clean water and to administer measures aimed at ensuring that the right to water is realised .Following a two-year investigation, the commission found the municipality violated the rights of residents to both water and health by its failure to provide access to sufficient water fit for human consumption , reads part of the report.In its report, the SAHRC noted contractors were appointed in November 2012 to construct a reservoir and pipeline from Jagersfontein to Fauresmith as part of Phase 2 of the water supply scheme.However, Jones said, the construction has not yet been completed, which has resulted in interruptions in the supply of tap water to the residents of Fauresmith .Among the recommendations by the SAHRC is for the municipality to provide an operations and maintenance plan detailing how it would run supply efficiently within three months.The latest inspection revealed water supply water interruptions occur and residents of Fauresmith must phone the municipality and request that water be delivered by truck (but) there is no set time for water delivery, which results in some residents not being available to access this water , Jones said.According to the report the municipality was directed to convene regular feedback sessions every three months on the supply of water to residents. This is also not being adhered to Jones said, and the municipality does not communicate with the residents of Fauresmith regarding when interruptions in water supply will occur or when the problem will be resolved .Jones said the water truck was unable to provide sufficient water for all the residents of Fauresmith, which results in some residents having to wait for a number of hours while the water truck returns to Jagersfontein to be refilled.DA Free State spokesperson Nomawethu Sbukwana criticised the municipality for failing to abide by the SAHRC s recommendations. The DA is not surprised by the municipality s non-compliance because it is in the nature of the ANC-governed municipalities not to respect Chapter 9 institutions.According to the commission, a letter was sent to municipal manager Lebo Moletsane in April, highlighting the observations made during the inspection and also the municipality s non-adherence to the recommendation.Jones said that to date the commission had not received any response from the municipality but that the commission reserved its right to subpoena the mayor and municipal manager if necessary.The DA said that it would ask questions in the council and should it not be satisfied with the responses, would once again write to the SAHRC requesting it enforce its recommendations.Siphiwe Mchunuprovinces@thenewage.co.za
