The notion of celebrating excellence was one of the reasons the founders of the Free State Press Forum decided to organise the first ever Free State Media Awards that will take place on November 19.The awards are intended to celebrate those who have performed admirably and be a motivation for all media practitioners in the province to seek to improve in the craft of journalism. We want to raise the bar of journalism, one of the organisers, Selloane Khalane, said. The awards will promote excellence in the media fraternity both in the private and the public sectors and it will serve as a gauge to see where are we in the province in terms of journalism, she said.Khalane said the awards will be held in Bloemfontein and entries were open for all journalists from commercial and local media houses to government and private sector communicators.The awards are also intended to encourage knowledge and excellence. Winners will secure bursaries so that they may improve to excel in their jobs.They also give journalists the motivation to work harder.According to Khalane, the other importance of the awards is to validate the work of the journalists and show how important their role is in society, which is to inform and educate the people they serve. At the forum we believe that journalists are watchdogs of society as it should be and not lapdogs. And with these awards we hope that the role will once again be inculcated, she said. The forum saw a need to recognise journalists by celebrating their work to ensure that the mandate of journalists, which is to be the watchdog of society, is never taken for granted. Journalists play an integral part in our daily lives as they are mostly the source of information and they sometimes work under tremendous pressure from deadlines. The awards will be supported by the Free State government and other entities.The forum was founded by Khalane along with Kamogelo Seekoei and Matli Mohanoe. It was launched in May.The forum will facilitate developmental courses for journalists, especially those who work for small media houses that do not have large resources to support their staff.Basetsana Makhalemele and Sisana Masithelaprovinces@thenewage.co.za
