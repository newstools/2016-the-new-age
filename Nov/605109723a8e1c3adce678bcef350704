&nbsp;The theft of Eskom s infrastructure, which includes copper cables, overhead lines, transformers and conductors, remains a serious concern for the power utility, Dileep John, head of the power utility s Operation Khanyisa, said yesterday.He said Eskom, along with entities such as Transnet, Telkom and municipalities, is plagued by syndicate-driven criminals. Copper theft costs the economy between R5bn and R7bn a year. Replacing stolen copper cables costs Eskom in the region of R2bn a year, John said, adding that the fight against infrastructure theft is being addressed by means of intelligence-driven investigations by the Hawks, which encompasses aggressive policing of the scrap metal market for stolen goods. In the 8 988 cable theft incidents reported between 2012 and 2016, 1159 arrests were made, John said. The courts are also taking this crime seriously and significant sentences are being handed out.A joint industry working group, formed by Eskom, Transnet, Telkom, the SAPS, the National Prosecuting Authority and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, continues to contribute positively in the fight against this crime.John said initiatives by Eskom included replacing copper conductors with aluminium; placing unique markings on all Eskom aluminium conductors, replacing all normal bolts on pylons with anti-theft bolts, engraving support lattices on steel pylons with Eskom s name on the steel and installing alarms on overhead lines.John said that the Criminal Matters Amendment Act, which came into effect this year, states that the minimum sentences for first-time copper thieves is three years and the maximum is 30 years.Sello Rabothata|sellor@thenewage.co.za
