President Jacob Zuma has promised more than 4000 Gauteng residents affected by flash floods a lasting solution for the killer Jukskei River. He called on all three spheres of the government (local, provincial and national) to work on different plans to assist all victims of floods, not only in Alexandra.Today marks exactly seven days since Everite Chauke, three, was swept away by the raging floods, that claimed about seven lives and destroyed homes and infrastructure. Everite s father, Shadrack Chauke, led Zuma, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen and Gauteng Premier David Makhura to the scene where he lost his little daughter. I was relaxing in bed, my wife was cooking and my daughter was playing, my wife then woke me up, telling me that water was coming inside the house. Noticing the level of the water, I climbed on the tree with my daughter cooking and my daughter was playing, my wife then woke me up, telling me that water was coming inside the house.
