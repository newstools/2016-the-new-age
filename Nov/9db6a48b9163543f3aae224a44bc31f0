FROM the dusty streets of Glencoe,to the vibey township of Umlazi, six new and upcoming designers have been handpicked by the KwaZulu-Natal Fashion Council (KZNFC) to showcase their fashion mastery talents at some of the leading stores in the country starting this week.The lucky designers are Rachel Molefe of Motherboard Project, Nokwanda Ngcobo of the 8th Wander,Marcus Mkhasibe from MM, Afro Amanno s Musawenkosi Sebeko and Eullue s Samuel Mosala in partnership with Eulender Cele.The group first went through a 21-steps to retail training programme earlier this year. From that platform,the designers went through vigorous training and were mentored at a fashion incubator called Igoda.Here they were provided with skills to maximise the growth, development and integration of the value chain of the clothing sector.The designers have brought about a whole new genre of talent, from the traditional to the modern to the ultra-hip. KZNFC s Palesa Kwitshana said: We need to connect the dots with industry, designers, retailers and business incubators.We can explore how we can work together and create value for South Africa and our provincial economy. Coupled with Africa s heritage and history we believe our province and its skilled and creative fashion designers can become the pioneers in luxury African fashion. The KZNFC, formed in 2009, was created to deal with challenges the clothing and textile industry faced such as a lack of resources, funding and a lack of promoting local designers with local goods. There is more to the KZNFC than just clothes. It is about job creation and empowerment. Fashion affects related industries such as jewellery, leather,footwear, hair and make up, Kwitshana said.Chairperson of the KZNFC board, Zola Shabangu, said: Raw talent has become refined and skilful young men and women have become confident to debut on the world stage. We are poised to provide skills to these designers to take their garments from the machine room floor to the shop floor. Designer duo team Mosala and Cele said participating in the programme had helped them sharpen their skills and taught them business skills.Ngcobo said before being exposed to the incubator, she owned her own studio but did not have access to equipment and was operating without any mentoring.nokuthulan@thenewage.co.zaNOKUTHULA NTULI
