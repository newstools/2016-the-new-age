Brazil coach Tite warned his side to be wary of Peru&#8217;s attacking threats, Christian Cueva and Paolo Guerrero, when the two teams clash in World Cup qualifying in Lima on Tuesday.Cuevo matched Guerreo&#8217;s qualifying tally of three goals by scoring in the 4-1 win away to Paraguay on Thursday, a win which moved Peru within three points of one of the region&#8217;s four qualifying spots.&#8220;Cueva, Guerrero, they are players that are&#8230; important,&#8221; Tite told reporters on Monday.Five-times world champions Brazil top the 10-team South American standings on 24 points from 11 games, 10 clear of Peru, after they beat arch rivals Argentina 3-0 at home on Thursday.They also beat Peru by the same scoreline last year but midfielder Fernandinho adopted a cautious tone, with Peru only losing once at home in five qualifying matches.&#8220;Peru is at home with the players that it has. We respect them a lot and know the qualities that they have,&#8221; he said.&#8211;Reuters
