Angolan refugees, some of whom have lived in South Africa for 20 years, have about two months left to apply for permanent residence or be deported back to their home country.This was an order made by the Western Cape High Court after a lengthy litigation process dating back to 2013 when the Department of Home Affairs announced it was revoking refugee statuses as Angola was no longer a war zone.The department said the circumstances that recognised Angolans as refugees no longer existed, therefore SA no longer had an obligation to protect them.As of that time, the Angolan refugees were given two years to work and study in SA while preparing to go back home.When their cessation permits were no longer valid they automatically became illegal immigrants.According to the Legal Resources Centre, which took the matter to court on behalf of Scalabrini Centre of Cape Town and a number of Angolan nationals, as part of the order, all Angolans who have held Angolan cessation permits are now able to submit applications for permanent residence and are exempted from paying the usual application fee.This was an agreement reached between the refugees and the Department of Home Affairs. The negotiated settlement allows for former Angolan refugees falling into this category to submit further documents to the Department of Home Affairs in order to attempt to regularise their stay in SA and apply for permanent residency, the organisation said.Welcoming the court order, Scalabrini Centre said an entire generation of children born to Angolan parents have grown up in SA and this was the only country they had ever known. Although by now all ACP permits have expired, the police and home affairs have agreed not to arrest, detain or deport any Angolans who have an ACP permit. Angolans in possession of these permits are encouraged to carry their permits and a copy of the court order with them at all times. The deadline for applications is January 20.Dudu Dubedudud@thenewage.co.za
