The ANC Women s League said South Africa was experiencing the downturn in the global economy which led to joblessness.The DA, however, said it regretted that 16000 residents of the Free State had lost their jobs in the past three months and questioned the ANC s economic policies and failure to create jobs.Statistics South Africa released its quarterly labour force survey on Tuesday and revealed that unemployment figures in the province had gone up with figures reaching 34.2%, up 1.9% from the previous quarter.Out of a provincial labour force of 1.186 million people, 405000 people are unable to find a job and 85000 of them have completely given up on looking for work.Stats SA reported that the number of employed persons increased in seven of the nine provinces between the second and third quarters.The largest employment gains were observed in Gauteng (126000), the Eastern Cape (93000) and the Western Cape (49000), while the Free State and the North West recorded employment declines of 16000 and 15000 respectively.Things did not look good in the province s only metropolis either, as the organisation reported that between the second and third quarters of this year, employment levels increased in all metropolitan municipalities, with the exception of Mangaung where the number of employed declined by 7000. Quarterly increases in the official unemployment rate were observed in four of the eight metropolitan municipalities, with Mangaung recording the largest increase of 2.2 percentage points, Stats SA said.Not only did people have to contend with poor service delivery, they also found it increasingly more difficult to secure jobs, it said. The scourge of unemployment in the Free State continues to rise as the ANC-led provincial government s misguided economic policies and poor governance continue to hamper economic growth in the province, DA leader in the legislature Roy Jankielsohn said.In a statement, the ANC Women s League (ANCWL) said it had noted Stats SA s report.The ANCWL said the figures were worrisome as various studies had shown that unemployed women were facing a greater risk of domestic violence.It said that according to the studies, economic dependency was one of the reasons why women were being subjected to and endured violence.The league said South Africa was not immune to the global economic challenges that required all parties, including the government and the private sector, to work together to address the challenge of unemployment.The positive outcomes of addressing unemployment, it said, would yield positive spin-offs in addressing domestic violence in the country, which some women and children were subjected to on a daily basis.KAMOGELO SEEKOEIkamogelos@thenewage.co.za
