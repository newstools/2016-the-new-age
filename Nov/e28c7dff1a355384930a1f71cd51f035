Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has been invited to give a status report on policing-related issues to the portfolio committee on police next Wednesday.The chairperson of the portfolio committee, Francois Beukman,aid yesterday recent reports about investigations involving the South African Police Service and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) had not gone unnoticed.The portfolio committee, which plays an oversight role on both SAPS and Ipid, wanted urgent clarification on these matters. We need assurances that the executive is dealing with the matters at hand, Beukman said.It was vital, he said, that the portfolio committee be thoroughly briefed on matters in the public domain to enable it to make an assessment of these matters and make appropriate recommendations where necessary. We need stability in our law enforcement agencies at all times and we cannot allow a situation where public confidence in these institutions is eroded by inter-agency conflicts, Beukman said.He said the public expected law enforcement agencies to focus on the fight against crime and, as such, should always make that their number one priority.Meanwhile, two important information sessions that will impact the lives of millions of South Africans, young and old, as well as the economically most vulnerable will take place in Parliament. Today the Department of Basic Education will brief the education portfolio committee about preparations for school readiness for 2017.The briefing will focus on enrolments and pupil-teacher support. Tomorrow the South African Social Security Agency, which pays out R10bn a month in social grants to 17 million poor South Africans, will appraise the social development portfolio committee about its preparedness to take over the payment of social grants in April next year.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
