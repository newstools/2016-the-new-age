Comedian, erstwhile talk-show host and life-long car obsessive Jay Leno is putting his name to a range of products for cleaning and detailing.Developed in partnership with AP51, the cleaning and detailing line has taken eight years to perfect. Branded &#8220;Jay Leno&#8217;s Garage&#8221; after the comedian&#8217;s immense car and motorcycle storage facility and the web series and subsequent TV show the garage has spawned, the range will initially launch as a seven-piece kit.However, it will eventually grow into a larger range of individual products and items including individual waxes, soaps, and dressings.Leno and AP51 are quick to point out that the tie-in isn&#8217;t a gimmick and that every product is about delivering best-in-class results while remaining easy to use.&#8220;We&#8217;ve poured our blood, sweat and tears into formulating products that meet Jay&#8217;s standards. It was a tough bar to reach. Most car-guys would only dream of showing their beloved baby at a show like Pebble Beach&#8217;s Concours d&#8217;Elegance, [where professional detailing is a necessity] but Jay has upwards of five cars in his collection that have not only shown, but won at that event,&#8221; said Jeremy Porrazzo of AP51.-Relaxnews
