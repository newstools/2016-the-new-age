Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) said it is concerned about allegations that State Security Minister David Mahlobo is involved in a illegal rhino horn trading syndicate and have urged him to &#8220;come clean&#8221; on the matter.The remarks follow the airing of a documentary on news channel Al Jazeera which alleges a link between Mahlobo and Chinese national Guan Jiang Guang who is part of the syndicate.&#8220;With the mandate of the State Security Agency (SSA) being to provide the government with intelligence on domestic and foreign threats or potential threats to national stability among others, and the South African government now treating the poaching of rhinos as a threat to national security, we are of a firm view that Mr Mahlobo s alleged association with illegal rhino horn traders undermine the integrity of the very department he is heading,&#8221; said Popcru in a statement.For his part David Mahlobo has on Monday called for a police investigation to clear his name following allegations that he has links to a illegal rhino horn smuggling syndicate.&#8220;Mahlobo has called on Mpumalanga Police Commissioner to immediately investigate all allegations made against him,&#8221; said Ministry of State Security spokesperson Brian Dube.In the documentary rhino-horn trafficker Guang claims to have a close relationship with Mahlobo and shows pictures taken with the Minister at his Mbombela Spa as proof of their close ties. He further alleges that Mahlobo is a frequent visitor to his establishment.Minister Mahlobo admits to visiting the spa however denies any wrongdoing associated with rhino poaching.&#8220;Guang apparently stated that he had some sort of friendship with Minister Mahlobo and that the Minister on some occasions attended to his private residence as well. This is not true,&#8221; reads the statement by Mahlobo.&#8220;Minister Mahlobo is not a friend of Mr. Guang and has never visited him at his residence. The photo that appeared on Al Jazeera and in the Sunday papers is a photo taken when the Minister was being treated at a manicure table and Guang requested a photo to be taken. This is clear from the photo itself,&#8221; continues the statement.The Minister has asked, along with an investigation into the allegations made against him, for Police to take action against Guan for illegal rhino poaching activity.Mahlobo further requests Police to look into claims by Guan that he employs illegal immigrants and circumvents immigration laws.The Minister has also said he would be looking into charging news station Al Jazeera with defamation following broadcast of the documentary. It is extremely reckless and mischievous for an internationally renowned broadcaster like Al Jazeera to be broadcasting such misleading content despite our response, said Mahlobo.&nbsp;TNA Reporter&nbsp;
