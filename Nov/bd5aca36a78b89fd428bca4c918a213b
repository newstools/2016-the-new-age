While many football personnel don t enjoy the Fifa international break as they believe it breaks the momentum, Polokwane City striker Thobani Mncwango appreciates its interruption this time.Mncwango believes it came at the right time for City as it give them a chance to fix all the mistakes they have been committing since the beginning of the season.City s start to the season under coach Luc Eymael hasn t been particularly poor but Mncwango feels they could have done better.The Limpopo outfit occupy seventh spot on the PSL table with 10 points after eight matches.They are six points behind log leaders Bidvest Wits and in the top eight, a place the club is mandated by the bosses to finish the season in.Mncwango, the club s top goal scorer last season, is convinced if it wasn t for minor but costly mistakes they would be in an even better position.Whether Rise and Shine have managed to get their house in order or not will be seen when they visit struggling Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr Molemela Stadium on Sunday. The break gave us a good chance to fix our mistakes. Before it, we were struggling to concentrate towards the end of the game, Mncwango said. There are a few matches that we lost or drew because we couldn t give 100% focus in the last few minutes. One of the games City threw away was last month when they allowed Orlando Pirates to equalise in the final minutes of the match which ended 1-1.Also last month, they allowed Baroka FC to get an equaliser in a 2-2 draw with the Absa Premiership rookies scoring during the referee s optional time. We have sat down with the coach and spoke about that, we even worked on it during our training sessions.I believe we have managed to fix the problem. Siwelele are two spots away from the relegation zone and are under the leadership of interim coaches Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka. Celtic have been struggling but we can t take that as an advantage because they also had time to fix things, Mncwango said. They are determined to change their situation so it will be a tough game for us because we are away.. Sithembiso Dindisithembisod@thenewage.co.za
