The binational agreements between our national governments create huge opportunities for business to business partnerships as well as collaboration between sister cities and regional governments, Makhura said.He said the GPG was ready to play its collaborative role under the guidance of the national cabinet. Gauteng is open for business. Our businesses and firms have capabilities and the resources to contribute to the industrialisation of Namibia, SADC and the continent, he said.SA has always been Namibia s top trading partner for both imports and exports. The two countries have 71 signed agreements and memoranda of understanding.In 2015, some of the top products Gauteng exported to Namibia included vehicles, electrical machinery and equipment, iron and steel, mineral fuels, pharmaceutical products and furniture among others.Last year, the provincial government adopted an overarching Gauteng City Region International Relations Strategy to coordinate and take a focused approach to international relations to promote both the social and economic objectives of the province s transformation, modernisation and reindustrialisation programme.The strategy has a particular focus on Africa and aims to execute the provincial government s developmental mandate, while enhancing the province s global competitiveness, in particular as a preferred gateway to the rest of Africa.With its strong focus on the SADC region and Africa, Makhura believes that the strategy will increase trade inflows over the next few years.
