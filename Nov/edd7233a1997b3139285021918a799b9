&nbsp;Kaizer Chiefs midfielder George Lebese feels the new formation being used by coach Steve Komphela will result in limited game time for him at the club.In the last two matches, against Free State Stars and Mamelodi Sundowns, Komphela used three central defenders coupled with wingbacks Ramahlwe Mphahlele, Tsepo Masilela or Sibusiso Khumalo, who also served as attacking wingers.This has left Lebese out in the cold and to add salt to the wound Chiefs lost both matches. It s the decision of a coach to decide whether to play wings on the side or wingbacks, Lebese said. In our recent games, he played wing-backs and that s why the wingers haven t been getting game time. It is a bit of a change to the formation where the coach has to sacrifice one midfielder and it happened to be me. I need to work harder and if given the opportunity; I will work to stay in the team. The formation has been criticised by many, including Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane who implied that the Chiefs personnel were not equipped with the right tools for it to work.Since the change in system, Chiefs have conceded four goals in two matches, but Lebese feels the formula is working despite not getting the results. I think because we are playing with three central defenders, our wing-backs turn into wingers, he said. It has been working but we haven t been getting the results. Hopefully I will get a chance to play against SuperSport United. Ahead of the match against SuperSport United at FNB Stadium tomorrow, the 27 year old said Chiefs need to get back to winning ways following the string of poor results. Chiefs have not won a league match since they defeated Ajax Cape Town 2-0 on October 15. We need to get the confidence back and for the supporters to have that trust in us because they have been very impatient with us since we started losing, Lebese said.
