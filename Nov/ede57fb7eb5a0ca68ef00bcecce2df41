THE Free State High Court in Bloemfontein on Thursda sentenced a 42-year old man from Sasolburg to 36 life sentences.The convict, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victims, was sentenced after he was found guilty of 36 counts of rape, 16 counts of sexual assault, 540 counts of possession of child pornography, 108 counts of distribution of child pornography and 228 counts of creation of child pornography.Judge Jake Moloi sentenced the accused to 36 life sentences for each count of rape, an additional 10 years for having sexual intercourse with a minor, five years for each count of sexual assault, 15 years for possession of child pornography, 15 years for distribution of child pornography and 20 years for the creation of child pornography.The man was also found in possession of 200000 photos of children and a number of videos of several children being raped. Director of public prosecutions in the province, advocate Xolisile Khanyile, welcomed the sentences. We hope that the sentence will have a deterrent effect to would-be offenders and the NPA is very pleased with the sentence. Justice has really been served. It s just unfortunate that young children were violated like this by someone they trusted, Khanyile said. During the trial, the court heard that the accused raped his sevenyear-old daughter 13 times between July 2009 and March 2012.In August 2011, he began raping his other daughter, who was six years old at the time, and he went on to rape her nine times until May 2014. He also raped his daughters friends, aged between five and eight, who slept over at his place after getting permission from their parents.State prosecutor advocate Ena Liebenberg asked the court to impose a hefty sentence because the accused had violated his own children.She also said the accused was a danger to society. The public is outraged by this rampant scourge and it is the duty of the court to impose harsher sentences in order to deter further criminal conduct, Liebenberg said.During sentencing, Moloi said that child rape made the accused s actions even more serious as he had failed to protect those in society who were the most vulnerable and helpless. He ordered that all the sentences run concurrently with the 36 life terms.-BECKER SEMELA
