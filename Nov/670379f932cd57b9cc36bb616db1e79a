Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says the Constitution is the only solution to the country&#8217;s challenges. She was speaking at the Chief Albert Luthuli Memorial Lecture in KwaZulu-Natal, Durban. The theme for this year addresses the role of the Constitution in fostering nation building and social cohesion in society.Mkhwebane says religious studies and early school curriculum should include constitutional examination. Our Constitution remains the only guiding light. It can deliver us to the Proverbial promised land. Preachers send their entire lives encouraging and persuading us not only to read but also to study the bible.&#8220;Why can&#8217;t we use the same preachers and teachers to teach us the Constitution so that we can live this particular document? I believe more should be done to inculcate constitutional studies in our curriculum especially at a very young age, she says.However, renowned poet and author, Dr. Wally Serote, questions whether the Constitution represents so-called Bantu South Africans and diversity. Does it enable and empower the nation to engage and seek expression and resolve the issues of poverty, unemployment, discrimination and the expression of the Bantu South African voice? Should it be a constitutional requirement or amendment which leads to the expression or the reconciliation and development programme of the soul of the Bantu South Africans to find expression? -SABC
