The role played by farmers with disabilities in the food security production and agricultural growth will for the first time be appreciated by authorities during a ceremony at Bolivia Lodge outside Polokwane today.Agriculture and rural development MEC Mapula Mokaba-Phukwana said the awards were aimed at showcasing the potential by farmers with disabilities whose conditions did not discourage them from participating in farming and food production. Agriculture is a diverse economic opportunity and for a long time we have not given due recognition to one of the distinguished, deserving category the farmers with disabilities, Mokaba-Phukwana said. We are only using this period of Disability Month to acknowledge their contribution but it is worth mentioning that their involvement takes place continuously. Mokaba-Phukwana said the award ceremony would be preceded by a summit to give various invited role players in the agriculture industry a platform to share economic activities, with particular focus on agriculture for disabled farmers.It is not clear how many disabled farmers were producing commercially in the province because of the slow pace of transformation in the sector.Subsistence farmers who were disabled were mostly women who used hand implements, some on wheelchairs to plant vegetables.Those who run livestock such as cattle or poultry but have disabilities relied on workers to take care of their stock. The government and farmers unions are yet to come up with an updated register of disabled farmers who were actively involved in farming.montshom@thenewage.co.za
