Oliver Tambo was more aware than any other ANC leader how much of a thorn in the flesh of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe, the Cubans, Swapo and others the South African Defence Force was.He knew that despite the significant weakening of the apartheid economy by the time of negotiations in the early 90s, their military strength remained among one of the several factors that made it possible for the South African government to negotiate from a position of strength.Tambo knew that despite regional animosities, no African army at the time posed a serious or immediate challenge to South Africa s military might and its domestic enemies were not organised or equipped enough to confront the power of the state.From the 60s into the 90s South Africa made its presence felt in South West Africa (Namibia) and Angola, Rhodesia, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Zambia, Transkei and surrogate operations and attacks on liberation and other organisations opposed to the South African government and then there was that attempted coup in the Seychelles.Tambo knew that the heart of a lion that all South Africans had and their sheer numbers was enough to destroy the apartheid government but it would come at an unacceptable loss of life.Then the transformative moment came and the country began to explore a different path to freedom. White South Africans and black South Africans began a conversation about building a new nation. As Floyd Shivambu said, quoting Thabo Mbeki, peace could never trump justice.Fw de Klerk, whatever his sins, was a critical element that was necessary for leading his followers to the tables of peace.Of course, the fact that today, Julius Malema says justice trumps peace (when he says, with his illusions of grandeur, that if he became president he would arrest De Klerk) reveals his lack of knowledge.The 1993 Constitution ended with an epilogue entitled National Unity and Reconciliation.It stated, among other things. This Constitution provides a historic bridge between the past of a deeply divided society characterised by strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustice, and a future founded on the recognition of human rights, democracy and peaceful coexistence and development opportunities for all South Africans, irrespective of colour, race, class, belief or sex. Today the ANC wants all SA s citizens to transform South Africa into a non-racial country.The ANC has acknowledged the conditions that gave birth to the EFF as a matter of reality. During this period, the EFF has moved to blaming our negotiated settlement, Nelson Mandela, the ANC, and white South Africans for this perceived slow change.The EFF is being contradictory, calling for an undoing of the 1994 project, citing it as a deal with the devil which only promised a continuation of the subjugation of black people and white superiority.Malema has occasionally called for the taking up of arms, for land invasion and calling for the outright assault of white South Africans, but not yet . Student activist Mcebo Dlamini clearly shares these sentiments.What then is giving Malema such confidence today to recklessly and engage in war talk almost on a daily basis? It is of course the very ANC he despises that helped create this space that allows his political immaturity to thrive without consequence.It s much easier to be reckless with your radical rhetoric when everyone else around you is committed to peace.The ANC has always rejected as a false sentiment the assertion that the steps taken at the beginning of democracy as part of the process of ending white minority rule constituted an act of treachery.The ANC asked itself then and every day whether there are things that make up the national interest to which all can adhere, regardless of racial or partisan interests.It is building in those measures that we have come to have a country that works so well, despite the brutal past only 22 years ago.Malema is, of course, still young and the young are usually prone to foolishness and the latest fads.Yonela DikoYonela Diko is the ANC Western Cape spokesperson
