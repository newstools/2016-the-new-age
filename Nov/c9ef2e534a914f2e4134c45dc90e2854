Stereolabs has unveiled the Linq, a new augmented reality headset that promises a particularly spectacular experience.In a video demo posted online, a gamer can be seen shooting enemy robots invading his office. The result looks seriously impressive.Even more spectacular than virtual reality, augmented reality also referred to as mixed reality sees gamers interact with virtual reality elements inserted into real-world environments. In this respect, the Stereolabs device turns gamers&#8217; own living rooms or offices into gaming spaces, or even virtual battlefields.The mixed-reality experience is made possible thanks to technology in the onboard ZED 3D camera, which can digitally analyze and map real-world environments, detecting walls, objects and people in the room. According to its designers, the technology is incredibly effective both indoors and outdoors.Linq is even promising wireless operation with no lag. A first kit for developers should be available in 2017, compatible with Windows and Linux.There&#8217;s no word yet on price, but it&#8217;ll probably come close to the cost of a home games console, according to Engadget. A consumer version of the device is expected to land at a later date.Until now, the leader in the world of augmented reality has been Microsoft&#8217;s Hololens. Previously only available in the US and Canada, the AR glasses are due on sale from November 2016 in six other countries (Germany, France, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand).Hololens sells for $3,000USD but the current model is aimed at developers and professionals rather than general users.Augmented reality and its spectacular possibilities will no doubt be one of the major trends in the tech world for 2017, whether for gaming or for day-to-day applications.-Relaxnews
