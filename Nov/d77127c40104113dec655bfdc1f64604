We are people of CR17 and are disciplined! Papikie Mohale (@mohalepapikie) November 24, 2016As a member of the tripartite alliance with the ANC alongside the South African Communist Party (SACP), the announcement is a significant endorsement for Ramaphosa&#8217;s bid to take over from Zuma next year.Previously the ANC called on structures to desist from making premature pronouncements on the succession matter.&#8220;We are mindful that we are not voting structure of ANC but we represent workers,&#8221; said Ntshalintshali.Ntshalintshali added that the CEC supports the proposal for the ANC to &#8220;explore possibilities of avoiding slates and contestations&#8221; during its next conference.#COSATU CEC resolves to support Cyril Ramaphosa to take over the reigns as the next president of the ANC pic.twitter.com/JaI6LWA4Hk @COSATU Today (@_cosatu) November 24, 2016Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini added that the decision to support Ramaphosa was taken because &#8220;he fulfills the characteristics of a good leader.&#8221;Dlamini also said that the federation was an influential member of the coalition despite not being a voting member of the ANC.Meanwhile Ntshalintshali said the federation had decided to make a definite call for support for a candidate taking into account that it was not a junior member of the alliance.&#8220;The CEC made it clear that Cosatu is not a junior partner in the Alliance and therefore it should not allow any alliance partner to instruct it on what it must do,&#8221; said Ntshalintshali.&#8220;We shall work to ensure that such attempts do not persist from any of our alliance partners because if this is not properly managed it has the potential of leading to the disintegration of the alliance and in undermining its unity and cohesiveness,&#8221; continued Ntshalintshali.Cosatu joins mine workers union NUM which in June during its National Executive Committee took a resolution at its Central Committee meeting to endorse Ramaphosa as the next ANC president.&#8220;This is not only based on the tradition of the ANC, but also on the suitability of the candidate. We firmly believe that debates on this issue should be organisational and people must stop swearing at others as that only serves to show how intolerant we are,&#8221; NUM said in a statement.-Siphiwe Mchunu
