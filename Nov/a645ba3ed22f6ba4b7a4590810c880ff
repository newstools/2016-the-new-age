If one is single and waiting to mingle, they usually have a ready list of desirable as well as undesirable traits that they want or don&#8217;t want in their prospective partners. And armed with that, they look out for Mr or Ms Right. According to recent research, there are particular personality traits that men and women don&#8217;t want in their partners, and consider them deal-breakers. Long-term deal-breakers Studies done on young single people have revealed that when it comes to long-term relationships, what puts off people most are traits like dishonesty and lying, issues with handling anger and emotions, and serious things like being casual about multiple partners. Also, issues of being an inattentive, uncaring person or someone who has addiction problems might be a deal-breaker for many. Short-term deal-breakers When it comes to short-term relationships, most men and women feel that an unclean, unhygienic and disheveled look ranks high in the list of deal-beakers. Health issues like sexually transmitted diseases are no-nos and so are traits like being a racist, lazy or careless. Men and women are also wary of partners who seem to be emotionally too needy.
