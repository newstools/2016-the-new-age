Free State Stars reserve side coach David Vilakazi says the victory over Cape Town City in the Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) will bring much needed confidence to the team. Ea Lla Koto s MDC outfit defeated City 2-0 at Makhulong Stadium on Saturday. An early goal from Thabo Maphakisa after a mistake by City goalkeeper Luca Comitis and a second half strike from Charles Kampi was enough to hand Stars their third victory in six matches.Vilakazi was not thoroughly impressed by the performance of his boys but he is happy to have won the match. He said the victory gives Stars a good chance to challenge for the title now as they are in the top eight with 10 points. It is good for us, we needed the win badly, Vilakazi said. Our aim was to grab maximum points in order to move up to at least 10th on the log. This win gives us so much confidence going forward. Fortunately for us, the same boys play in our ABC Motsepe team so the break did not really affect us. We were a bit sluggish but the most important thing is that we managed to score the two goals. City coach Craig Roslee said conceding in the opening minute derailed their plans for the match. We conceded a goal in the first 20 seconds of the game, that must be a record. After that we became very nervous because the boys didn t want to commit another mistake, Roslee said. I wasn t happy with our overall play. I thought our passing was very poor and that is something that we pride ourselves on. I don t think we were competitive enough overall.
