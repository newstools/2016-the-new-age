African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe has on Tuesday described the Democratic Alliance&#8217;s(DA) upcoming no confidence motion against President Jacob Zuma as a growing sign of arrogance by the opposition.&#8220;To think that they can convince members of the ANC to vote along with their motion we interpret as a sign of growing arrogance on the part of the DA,&#8221; said Mantashe.Mantashe was speaking during a press conference where the party was reporting back following their National Working Committee (NWC) meeting which was held on Monday.#Mantashe: ANC members must resist the temptation to play to the gallery by supporting motions opposed to the advancement our revolution MyANC (@MYANC) November 8, 2016He further dismissed the impending no confidence debate saying the DA had caused the motion to lose its meaning due to bringing it up repeatedly.&#8220;The DA has made this an annual frivolous ritual which has no chance of success,&#8221; said Mantashe.Earlier on Tuesday the DA announced it had received confirmation from Parliament that its motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma will be debated on Thursday.Acting speaker of the National Assembly Lechesa Tsenoli confirmed in a letter to the DA&#8217;s Chief Whip John Steenhuisen that the motion was now part of Parliament&#8217;s schedule.Mantashe called on the ANC in Parliament to come together and vote against the motion brought by the DA.&#8220;ANC MP&#8217;s must not support motions brought against ANC members,&#8221; said Mantashe.The DA is no stranger to raising a motion of no confidence only to have it shot down with relative ease by the ruling party.Most recently, the party&#8217;s motion was defeated by the ANC 225 to 99.ANC MPs have repeatedly dismissed the DA&#8217;s motions as frivolous. Last year a similar motion was predictably defeated by an ANC majority when a total of 221 members voted against it and 113 were in favour.The ANC in 2012 blocked then DA Parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko&#8217;s motion altogether from being debated in the national Assembly.-TNA Reporter
