Ford and Lego have taken the wraps off a new Speed Champions&#8217; set that recreates the GT cars that clinched the chequered flag at the world&#8217;s most famous endurance race in 1966 and 2016The new set features a 1966 Ford GT 40 and its hi-tech modern day counterpart as well as corresponding Lego Minifigures, a Lego chequered flag and even a trophy.&#8220;This was a dream project &#8211; with a lot of pressure. The Ford GT40 is one of the most iconic race cars of all time, and the new Ford GT is just incredible,&#8221; said Craig Callum, head of design, LEGO Speed Champions. &#8220;Designed for children, but with grown-ups fans in mind too, we know these models will be closely scrutinized for authenticity.&#8221;A host of Ford cars have already been captured in Lego brick form but with this latest set, the company is hoping to influence career choices of the future as well as continuing to preserve its performance achievements.&#8220;This kit is a powerful way to tell our Le Mans story, and will hopefully inspire the race drivers, engineers, and designers of the future,&#8221; said Dave Pericak, global director, Ford Performance.Unfortunately, the new Speed Champions set won&#8217;t be going on sale until March 2017.-Relaxnews
