Congolese Prime Minister Augustin Matata Ponyo resigned Monday to make way for an opposition figure to take his place following talks aimed at averting a political crisis.&#8220;I have offered my resignation as well as those of the members of my government&#8230; to respond to the spirit and the letter of the accord,&#8221; said Matata as he left a meeting with President Joseph Kabila, referring to the deal struck after a political dialogue boycotted by the main opposition parties.-AFP
