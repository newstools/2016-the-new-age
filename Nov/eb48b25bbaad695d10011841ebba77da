Durban residents should brace themselves for more bad weather following Monday s thunderstorms in the city and surrounding areas.The South African Weather Service is expecting weather conditions to deteriorate over the next few days with lightning and thunderstorms expected to create havoc across the province.While the next few days will start off with cool and sunny conditions, forecaster Wiseman Dlamini said the conditions were likely to deteriorate as the week progressed, resulting in heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms.The extreme weather conditions have in recent weeks left a trail of destruction across the province with more than a 1000 people left homeless after their homes were destroyed by storms.In Nongoma, local resident Mbekeni Gina lost two children after his home was struck by lightning a week ago. We have in the past experienced unnecessary loss of life in communities living near rivers. We urge motorists to drive carefully and to avoid crossing low-lying bridges, cooperative governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said.The department has prioritised the rollout of lightning rods in incident-prone areas and communities are encouraged to buy these rods which have a radius of 100m.Clive Ndou
