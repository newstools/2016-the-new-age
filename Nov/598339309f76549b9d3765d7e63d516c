The new OnePlus 3T claims to power through a whole day&#8217;s use from just half an hour of charge time.This puts the smartphone up there with those offering the longest-lasting battery lives, an important factor when it comes to choosing a new phone.This enhanced version of the OnePlus 3 has a 2.35 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 6GB of RAM and up to 128GB of onboard memory. It comes with the manufacturer&#8217;s in-house Dash Charge technology, promising super-fast charging and claiming to be faster and safer than competitor versions.The battery capacity has also been upped to 3,400mAh, gaining 13% on the current OnePlus 3.More and more smartphones now promise batteries that can last out the day with ease. At the top end of the market, the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge (3,600mAh) can run for two days without being charged, for example.The same goes for the Huawei Mate 9 (4,000mAh). In comparison, Apple announces 15 hours of battery life on Wi-Fi for the iPhone 7 Plus (2,900mAh).It&#8217;s also possible to find lower-end models that can run for two days on a single charge, depending on the type of usage. The Asus Zenfone Max (5,000mAh), the Moto Z Play (3,510mAh), the Acer Liquid Z630 (4,000mAh) and the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2,900mAh) are a few examples.Note that while the battery capacity in milliampere hours (mAh) is a key figure when it comes to ensuring running time, this must be paired with power efficient components in the device to ensure long-lasting power.One device that stands out in the field is the Oukitel K10000, which can easily last for five days without recharging thanks to its 10,000mAh battery.However, this is pretty much the only advantage this heavy and bulky smartphone has to offer. It perhaps serves as proof that good battery life shouldn&#8217;t come to the detriment of everything else.The OnePlus 3T is due out November 22 in the USA priced from $439.-Relaxnews
