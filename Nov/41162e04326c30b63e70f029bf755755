Kristaps Porzingis scored 27 points as the New York Knicks defeated the Chicago Bulls 117-104 to make it a triumphant return for Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah on Friday.Porzingis, controversially benched during New York&#8217;s defeat to Detroit earlier this week, added five rebounds to lead the scoring for the Knicks at the United Center.Carmelo Anthony was close behind Porzingis, contributing 25 points and seven rebounds.But the linchpin of the victory was the returning Rose, who joined the Knicks in the close season in a blockbuster trade after eight seasons in Chicago.Rose finished with 15 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds in the win. Noah had 16 points, nine rebounds and four assists.&#8220;It was fun, I&#8217;m a competitor, I compete,&#8221; a satisfied Rose said after a win which improved the Knicks record to 2-3.&#8220;The game was big because we&#8217;d dropped two games. We needed to figure out how to win.&#8220;We&#8217;ve all got individual skills but figuring out how to win games, we&#8217;ve got to put our skills aside to get the win. I think that&#8217;s what we did tonight,&#8221; Rose added.Noah had also made the same switch from Chicago to New York in the close season after nine years with the Bulls.Noah drew cheers during introductions while Rose was greeted by cheers as well as a few jeers.Both exchanged warm greetings with ex-teammates.&#8220;There&#8217;s no bad blood between nobody with the franchise or nobody on that team,&#8221; said Rose, whose relationship with former teammate Jimmy Butler was under scrutiny last season as Chicago under-performed.&#8220;I wish everybody well,&#8221; Noah said adding that while he was frustrated in his last season in Chicago, &#8220;the things I remember the most are good memories from everybody.&#8221;Chicago star Dwyane Wade led the overall scoring, pouring on 35 points and 10 rebounds in a losing effort.Butler weighed in with 26 points, but Nikola Mirotic was the only other Bulls player to make double figures.The defeat leaves the Bulls at 3-2 after the opening five games of the season.&nbsp;AFP
