Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is concerned that her predecessor Thuli Madonsela s move to leak a recording of her state capture interview with President Jacob Zuma could compromise the trust that the public has in her office.The presidency and the office of the speaker of the National Assembly lodged complaints over the issue, prompting Mkhwebane to open a case at Brooklyn police station in Pretoria.The spokesperson for the public protector, Kgalalelo Masibi, said Mkhwebane had only requested an investigation into the alleged leaks to establish if they amount to a breach of Section 7 (2) of the Public Protector Act. In order to maintain the credibility of the public protector and for the people to trust the institution we need to safeguard whatever evidence such people, including whistle-blowers, give to us, Masibi said.He denied reports that Mkhwebane had laid charges against Madonsela as reported by a local Sunday paper.The paper said that she had pressed criminal charges against her predecessor for giving the recording to a local TV news channel.Earlier this month, Madonsela admitted to leaking the recording of her interview with Zuma and said she had absolutely no regrets as the truth had to be told.She said she released the audio to show that she gave the president a chance to answer her questions.-MTHOKOZISI DUBE
