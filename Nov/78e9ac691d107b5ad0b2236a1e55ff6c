Shares in Samsung&#8217;s drug-making unit soared almost six percent on their market debut Thursday, after one of South Korea&#8217;s biggest ever initial public offerings that raised nearly $2 billion.Samsung Biologics, a contract manufacturer of biotech drugs for global pharmaceutical firms, soared 5.88 percent to 144,000 won ($125) in Seoul, putting its total value at nearly 9.5 trillion won.The firm was set up by the South Korean conglomerate in 2011 as part of a multi-billion-dollar drive to find new growth avenues including healthcare and green energy over the next decade.The highly anticipated IPO is the second largest in South Korea&#8217;s history, raising 2.25 trillion won ($1.96 billion), which the unit says will be used to expand production capacity and invest in research and development.The firm makes biopharmaceutical drugs for major firms including Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche at plants near Seoul.Bio-drugs, unlike chemically synthesised drugs, are made of organic, live substances such as plant or animal cells and are more complex to research and manufacture.Construction unit Samsung C&amp;T and the flagship Samsung Electronics together hold a 75 percent stake in Samsung Biologics after the share sale.The firm has been in the red for years with a net loss of 75.7 billion won in 2015 as it invested heavily in its two existing plants and a new facility slated to open in two years.Completion of the third plant is expected to make the company the world&#8217;s top contract drug manufacturer in terms of production capacity, said Woo Chang-Hee, analyst at IBK Investment &amp; Securities.The global biopharmaceutical market is expected to grow to $488 billion by 2025, compared with $164 billion in 2012, due to the world&#8217;s ageing population, Woo said.-AFP
