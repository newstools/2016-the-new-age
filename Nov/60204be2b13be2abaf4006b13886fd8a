Neymar scored his 50th international goal as Brazil thrashed Argentina 3-0 to tighten their grip on South America&#8217;s 2018 World Cup qualification campaign and leave their arch-rivals struggling to reach the finals.Barcelona superstar Neymar outshone club-mate Lionel Messi in Belo Horizonte &#8212; the venue where Brazil were humiliated 7-1 by Germany in the 2014 World Cup semi-finals.Argentina are outside of the qualifying places. But Messi insisted that the two time World Cup winners could still get through to the Russia finals.Neymar&#8217;s landmark strike was sandwiched by a spectacular effort from Liverpool&#8217;s Philippe Coutinho and a second-half finish from China-based midfielder Paulinho.Brazil have now won five straight qualifying games under new coach Tite, who took over after Dunga was sacked in June because of Brazil&#8217;s failure to get out of the Copa America Centenario group stage.Brazil now have 24 points from 11 games, one clear of second-placed Uruguay who have 23 points.The Brazilians are six points clear of third-placed Colombia and seven points clear of Ecuador and Chile, who are level on 17 points after 11 games.Argentina languishing outside the qualifying places in sixth with 16 points.The two-time world champions &#8212; who have taken just two points from their past four qualifiers &#8212; now face a crucial game at home to Colombia next Tuesday which they must win to avoid falling further off the pace.&#8220;We&#8217;re down but we&#8217;re still alive,&#8221; Argentina captain Messi said. &#8220;We have to forget the situation we&#8217;re in and start thinking about Colombia. If we get a result against Colombia it will make things look a lot different.&#8221;Argentina manager Edgardo Bauza admitted he had not expected to lose so heavily.&#8220;It&#8217;s a hard defeat. I did not think we would lose 3-0, I thought it would be an even game,&#8221; Bauza said. &#8220;But when they got their second it was all over.&#8221;Uruguay meanwhile stayed firmly on Brazil&#8217;s shoulder with a 2-1 defeat of Ecuador at Montevideo&#8217;s Estadio Centenario.The Uruguayans took the lead on 12 minutes when former Liverpool defender Sebastian Coates bundled in a corner from close range for his first international goal.Espanyol striker Felipe Caicedo then rounded off a sweeping Ecuador counter-attack to equalise just before half-time.But Uruguay responded immediately, Diego Rolan stabbing home a low finish on the stroke of half-time to restore the home side&#8217;s lead.&#8211;AFP
