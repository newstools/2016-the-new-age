AFTER performing a sold out show in Cape Town this past weekend, British reggae band UB40 will take their music to the Durban Botanic Gardens on Thursday.Britain s most successful reggae band of all time will wrap up their Red Red Wine tour with a one-time performance at TicketPro Dome on Saturday.The Grammy nominated band has for the past few months been on a tour that encompassed countries such as the Netherlands, the UK and Australia.In a message, leader of the band Ali Campbell said they looked forward to wrapping up the tour in South Africa. We ve had an outstanding couple of years on this world tour, what a way to finish it in South Africa, come and party with us, Campbell said.In 2008, frontman Ali left the original band, and was soon followed by keyboardist Mickey Virtue and Astro, real name, Terence Wilson. They regrouped in 2013 to form the breakaway UB40 band.Ali said he was still estranged from his co-founding brothers, Robin and Duncan, since the acrimonious 2008 disbandment.The trio touched down in Cape Town and took fans down memory lane, performing Red Red Wine, I Got You Babe and many others. With more than 70 million albums sold to date, UB40 is considered the most successful and influential reggae band in the world.-SIYABONGA SITHOLE
