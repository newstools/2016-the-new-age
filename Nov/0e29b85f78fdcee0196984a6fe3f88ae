Gold Fields is acquiring a 50% stake in Gold Road Resources Gruyere gold project for $350m.The company will a take a stake in cash and a 1.5% royalty fee on Gold Fields share of production after total mine production exceeds an approximate value of $15m.Gold Road is pioneering development in Australia and owns buildings covering 5000km in the region, which is historically under-explored and highly prospective for gold mineralisation.In addition to its retained 50% interest in Gruyere, Gold Road will continue to explore for similar-scale deposits on its 100% owned North Yamarna tenements and its 50%-owned South Yamarna tenements. Gold Fields and Gold Road will establish a 50:50 joint venture to start construction next year. Gold Fields chief executive Nick Holland said that the rationale for the acquisition was that Australia was a key part of their business and the largest cash generator. Gruyere will add life, margin and cash flow into what is already a strong region for Gold Fields and which has proven its ability to integrate new operations with ease, Holland said.Gold Road said that the company might also consider future capital management initiatives due to the transaction s financial flexibility.Gold Fields is already one of the largest gold producers in Australia. This transaction provides Gold Fields with exposure to an emerging goldfield in Western Australia, further enhancing the group s position in the region.Gruyere will add life and cash flow to a strategically important region for Gold Fields. Gold Road managing director and chief executive Ian Murray said that this partnership further strengthened their balance sheet and allowed them to significantly de-risk Gruyere and pursue growth plans much sooner than we may have under alternative funding options.The deal is subject to approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board.Thelma Ngoma|thelman@thenewage.co.za
