Since the inception of the broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) concept there has been an ongoing debate on who is actually benefiting, with people claiming that it benefits only a few politically connected individuals while the rest are left out. It has also seen a significant number of black people being used as fronts by some white companies who have exploited the loopholes that are or were open to abuse. The New Age s senior business writer Sello Rabothata posed a few questions to the acting commissioner of the B-BBEE Commission, Zodwa Ntuli, to explain what this all means and what the commission is doing about it.Who benefits from B-BBEE?What is B-BBEE?. Can you explain in layman s terms what the reasons were behind its formulation and what it hopes to achieve and when. How long has it been in existence?B-BBEE refers to a policy intervention that aims to close the economic gap between the rich and poor in South Africa by ensuring that black people become owners of productive assets of the economy, run and manage their own businesses, acquire equity stakes in existing businesses, are appointed to decision- making positions of businesses and can access market through preferential procurement.This means that black people, who were previously excluded by apartheid, must have access to real economic opportunities to participate fully in the economy of this country.This will assist the country to achieve the inclusive economy, and boost the economic growth, It is a constitutional imperative.The B-BBEE Act was introduced in 2003 and amended in 2013. Before it was amended, there were many problems with its implementation which resulted in B-BBEE benefiting a few well- connected individuals, even though the policy intentions were never that.The B-BBEE Commission started operating in April 2016, created specifically to help with the implementation, and eradicate fronting practices.How does one get involved? People are saying this benefits only a few well-connected individuals and don t know how ordinary people can benefit.There are five elements to benefit from, they are ownership, management control, skills development, supplier and enterprise development and socio-economic development.In simple terms, if you are an employee, you will benefit through skills development in that entities are required to spend 6% of their payroll to develop their own staff members, and other external people such as unemployed youth, to help them to grow and improve employability, or equip them with skills required to create and run their own businesses.If you are a small business, get yourself on the central supplier database to benefit from government work as the government must give preference to black-owned entities.Further, all measured entities are creating new supply databases to include black businesses as suppliers.On the other hand, they develop enterprise development schemes to invest in creation of new black enterprises to add on their supply chain.There are more opportunities for market access created by the B-BBEE requirements, training and enterprise support.The criticism that B-BBEE benefitted a few well-connected individuals is valid because only a few people who knew about these benefits accessed the bulk of the opportunities for themselves. That is how it was implemented before, which was wrong.With the B-BBEE Commission monitoring implementation, we trust that this will shift, and that B-BBEE will benefit all South Africans.So, instead of offering shares to an individual because of their connections, maybe companies must start offering shares to their own employees and create more value.What happens at the road shows. What concerns do the attendees raise most and what advice is given to them so they can implement the lessons learnt? How are the different levels structured?The one problem we identified is that the public does not have full knowledge of what B-BBEE is all about and, as a result, they are unable to take up the benefits that flow from it.Often companies will approach employees and tell them they will make them shareholders, without telling them that this is because of B-BBEE.Employees would be made to sign some form and, because of them being made shareholders, the B-BBEE status of the company changes to a better level.What companies however do not often do, is give the employees the financial benefit that must come with the shareholding, or allow them to participate in decisions of the company. Employees would just get some bonus or minor increase, when the company is reaping huge profits using the employees.Therefore, road shows are made to get the public to know about B-BBEE, the benefits, the opportunities, and to identify practices that merely take them for a ride. Issues raised mostly highlight that more awareness is needed.People perceive that some politicians and people connected to such politicians have hijacked B-BBEE, and deny the majority of black people the benefits.People still raise concerns about how procurement processes are manipulated under the guise of B-BBEE to give the government work to friends and cronies.These are realities that people have to face, and there is a need to change this picture to bring back confidence in B-BBEE.In terms of case studies, a number of companies seem to have crossed the line by trying to get around the do s and don ts of the code of practice and others have tried to legitimise fronting. How were these found out and what steps have been taken against them?Because B-BBEE was not properly monitored over the years, it allowed for a breed of unscrupulous and unethical individuals who pass ed themselves off as consultants and advisors.These people have made themselves experts and offer advice to many companies on how to break the law without getting caught.The main victims of these are employees, small businesses and community members.These companies create trusts or schemes and claim beneficiaries are black, and these trusts are then said to be black shareholders in companies, when in actual fact these are just vehicles to front black people.We monitor the market and we also receive complaints. As at September 30 we had 134 submitted, 84% of which relate to fronting. We are now close to issuing findings on some of these complaints, and these will be made public.We believe that our findings wilt start to change behaviour, not only of entities found guilty, but also of those that may be thinking about fronting.We have also issued 22 letters to verification agents that appear to be acting in a manner that is not acceptable.We also ordered some consultants (Net Value Holdings and Axidex and Innoven) to cancel sessions, which in our view were promoting sessions that were contrary to the B-BBEE objectives.On white-owned companies looking for black partners, how do potential black partners get involved and what should they be careful of to avoid being used in what could amount to fraudulent deals?Firstly, companies must develop their B-BBEE strategy and plan, outline what they want to do. For instance, on ownership the company must decide up front whether it wished to just sell equity to a new black partner, or whether it will create ownership scheme for its employees, or a combination of both.A proper due diligence on the options must be conducted to ensure that the options are implemented with utmost diligence. Then the companies can then implement its plan.Secondly, whatever the initiative, the company must have good intentions and negotiate in good faith. If the conditions of the B-BBEE initiatives only benefit the company, or are less favourable to the black person, that will constitute fronting.Therefore, it must not be done just to tick the box, but must be in a way that helps the company and black people realise the value.Thirdly, companies must choose their advisors and verification agents very well. An advisor that tells you how to best circumvent the Act is not the right one.The advisor must tell you the best way to implement the law to achieve the objectives.A verification agent that gives a company scores for why is not proper B-BBEE is a liability to that company, and a huge risk.Lastly, companies must not leave B-BBEE to consultants entirely, it must be part of the business. When you look for B-BBEE partners, apply your mind fully.There are entities such as Seda, who have databases of black businesses, and companies may approach them for assistance where necessary.?On the part of black people, the first thing they must know is that B-BBEE is not an avenue for quick financial benefit, but for empowerment of black people to participate in the economy effectively. When entering into a B-BBEE ownership deal and you are not sure, please contact us before signing on the dotted line.Black partners must ensure they read the documents given to them to sign, as most tie them and just make them indebted to the company for the rest of their lives without the corresponding benefits.A real B-BBEE ownership deal will be the one that gives you control over your shareholding, ability to exercise such control through your voting rights, the ability to derive economic benefit from the deal, and the ability to ultimately pay off the debt against which the shares were acquired.We offer prior advice to companies and individuals for free. They can always contact us for advice on B-BBEE.sellor@thenewage.co.za
