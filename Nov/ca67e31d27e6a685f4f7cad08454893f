Donald Trump&#8217;s election looms large over the race for president of America&#8217;s oldest ally France, where mainstream candidates all style themselves as uniquely qualified to prevent the far-right from causing a similar upset.On Thursday evening, right-wing candidates will take part in the last of three debates ahead of the first round on Sunday of a primary to pick their nominee, who is in turn widely expected to win next year&#8217;s election.Trump&#8217;s accession to the White House and what it might mean for National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen&#8217;s chances are expected to feature prominently in their exchanges.Prime Minister Manuel Valls admitted during a visit to Berlin on Thursday that it was &#8220;possible&#8221; that Le Pen could win next year&#8217;s election and warned against ignoring the &#8220;danger&#8221; of the far-right.If Le Pen reached the second round runoff in the election, &#8220;the balance of politics will change completely&#8221;, the Socialist premier said.In that second round, polls currently show she is likely to face the winner of the mainstream right-wing primary.Le Pen is polling at around 25-28 percent on the kind of nationalist, anti-immigration message that won over millions of US voters and convinced Britons to vote to exit the European Union.While the polls show Le Pen being defeated by the centre-right candidate in the second round of the election in May, she has gleefully brandished Trump&#8217;s shock victory as proof that &#8220;nothing is set in stone&#8221;.&#8211; &#8216;Hear the anger&#8217; &#8211;Both former president Nicolas Sarkozy and ex-prime minister Alain Juppe claim to be the best-placed to keep Le Pen out of power, in Sarkozy&#8217;s case by borrowing some of the FN&#8217;s ideas on immigration and Islam, and in Juppe&#8217;s by trying to unite French voters against her.Sarkozy, who is trailing Juppe in the primary, has pledged to curb immigration and intern suspected Islamist radicals following a wave of jihadist attacks.Like Le Pen, Sarkozy saw the US result as a sign, seizing on Trump&#8217;s victory as proof of a &#8220;rejection of group-think&#8221;.&#8220;How many Brexits, how many American elections, how many lost European referendums do you need to finally hear the anger of the people?&#8221; asked France&#8217;s 2007-12 president, who has attempted to reinvent himself as an anti-establishment candidate.With Trump in the White House and Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin, a tough leader will be needed to defend French interests, he argued.&#8220;There will be no room for impotence, weakness and renunciation,&#8221; he said, in a swipe at 71-year-old Juppe, whom he accuses of being &#8220;soft&#8221;.Frederic Dabi of pollsters Ifop said he was &#8220;very hesitant about the possible influence of Trump&#8217;s election on voting behaviour&#8221; in France.Rather than turning the French race on its head, he said it had &#8220;reinforced existing strategies&#8221;.&#8211; &#8216;I&#8217;m not Hillary Clinton&#8217; &#8211;Juppe, who has started to slide in polls, has rejected comparisons between himself and Trump&#8217;s ill-starred Democratic rival.&#8220;I&#8217;m not Hillary Clinton,&#8221; he insisted, calling French politicians who tried to make hay from Trump&#8217;s win &#8220;ridiculous&#8221;.The man with the longest CV in French politics has cast himself as a bulwark against both Le Pen, whose party topped the vote in last year&#8217;s regional elections, and Sarkozy.&#8220;Dividing for the sake of it is a dangerous game,&#8221; he told supporters at a rally in Paris on Monday.Warming up for Juppe on Monday, the leader of the allied centrist UDI party cast Sarkozy as the Gallic Trump.&#8220;We don&#8217;t want someone who flirts every day with the themes of the far right,&#8221; Jean-Christophe Lagarde declared. &#8220;France does not need a mini-Trump in the Elysee.&#8221;&#8211; &#8216;Hope&#8217; &#8211;The left meanwhile is staring at a possible replay of France&#8217;s last political earthquake &#8212; when FN founder Jean-Marie Le Pen defeated the Socialist candidate for a place in the 2002 presidential run-off that was won by Jacques Chirac.Fourteen years later, the left is again in tatters after a string of desertions from the side of the spectacularly unpopular President Francois Hollande.On Wednesday, Hollande&#8217;s former star economy minister Emmanuel Macron became the latest to repudiate his mentor, announcing a bid to become president even though Hollande himself has yet to say whether he will seek a second term.Deploring the &#8220;democratic crisis in Western societies&#8221;, 38-year-old ex-banker Macron said he would be the candidate of &#8220;hope&#8221;.Faced with terrorism, global warming and growing inequality, &#8220;we cannot respond with the same men and the same ideas,&#8221; he said.-AFP
