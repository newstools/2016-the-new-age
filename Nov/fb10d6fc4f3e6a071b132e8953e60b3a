The demand on Gauteng s transport system was growing at an unprecedented rate due to the massive population growth in the province.Unveiling his department s key projects in Pretoria yesterday, roads and transport MEC Ismael Vadi, said this was mainly due to increasing population, attributed to migration. Our population growth rate is the highest of all provinces in the country.The 2016 mid-year population estimates published by StatsSA in August estimates the provincial population at 13.5 million, implying that an additional 2.5 million people have since been added to the province since the last census, he said.Vadi said that three projects valued at more than R20m, would enable the department to accelerate transport service delivery in the province. One, the accurate mapping of minibus taxi routes in Gauteng. The lack of accurate taxi route networks has been the source of serious and violent conflicts in the minibus taxi industry. The minibus taxi network also represents a very large asset base that has not been quantified, which this process will help address, he said.He said the information would be used to help disseminate information about minibus taxi routes to the current and prospective users, including tourists. Also developing a master plan for the improved roll-out of new-look integrated transport services centres to house public services such as driver licensing and training centres, vehicle testing centres and transport operating license administrative bodies. The development of the transport norms and standards book for the province is based on scientific research. This will help communities in the province to hold government accountable for transport service delivery, he said.Other on-going programmes between the department and the CSIR include the rationalisation of the old subsidised bus services in the province.This includes the routes in Mamelodi, Meyerton and Kathorus that were rescinded by Putco in 2015 and subsequently taken over by AutoPax on a temporary basis.CSIR manager for transport system and operations Dr Mathetha Mokonyama said the projects would be completed within the next 10 months.Peter Ramothwalapeterr@thenewage.co.za
