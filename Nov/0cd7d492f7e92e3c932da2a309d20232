When her house burnt to the ground a few years ago, Ronell Koopman was devastated and was forced to start afresh.Koopman s children were in the house when the fire broke out but were able to vacate the house before it was engulfed in flames and everything destroyed.Koopman was telling her story to residents during the Safer Paraffin awareness campaign in Kimberley at the weekend.The campaign was a collaborative partnership between the department of trade and industry, the National Consumer Commission (NCC), the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications (NRCS), the National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) and the Sol Plaatje local municipality.Koopman s story was expected to have a positive impact on the behaviour of people living in Galeshewe.There was also a practical illustration of how a shack fire normally erupted. The fire department was on the ground and took the opportunity to give shack dwellers a real life experience while also educating them about the impact of fire on their lives.Moses Khangale from the national Department of Cooperative Governance, Traditional Affairs and Human Settlements said research indicated that most fires were caused by paraffin stoves. Khangale said the paraffin stoves themselves did not adhere to regulatory standards and were built with combustible material.He said 1 800 households in Warrenton, Galeshewe, Kimberley were visited to check on the standards of stoves people used. He said that officials confiscated 850 noncompliant and illegal paraffin stoves during the visits. Nthati Siphiri, the divisional fire officer of safety at the Sol Plaatje municipality urged residents to avoid using noncompliant stoves. The problem with these stoves is that if they are lit inside an enclosed shack will produce carbon monoxide, cause headaches and cause someone to suffocate. The nature of these stoves is that they need air to circulate, he said.Siphiri also urged parents to keep paraffin stoves away from the edges of tables and remove paraffin bottles from the reach of children.He said compliant stoves had a NRCS number on the product to show that it was tested and approved unlike non compliant ones. These stoves pose a risk to the safety and socio-economic well-being of the communities, he said.The acting chief executive officer of NCRS Edward Mamadise said it was quite disturbing that there were so many suppliers who continue to prey on the ignorance of vulnerable and poor consumers. They do this through selling paraffin stoves that are substandard and do not perform in line with the set of quality requirements. As the national regulator, we aim to stop these noncomplaint goods before they reach the market and ultimately the consumer. We do this by placing our inspectors at ports of entry and manufacturing plants to lock out these noncompliant products before they can reach the market, Mamadise said.NCC commissioner Ebrahim Mohamed said both the NCC and the NRCS had over the past three years done inspections which indicate that noncompliant paraffin appliances were quite popular among households because they were cheaper than the compliant ones.He said the inspection reports showed that the noncompliant appliances were not manufactured locally and that they were illegally imported into the country. We are also here to warn businesses to stop selling noncompliant appliances to our people, be it paraffin driven or electrical, and to make them aware that it is a violation of the law for which they can be criminally prosecuted if they persist with these sales. Consumers have the right in terms of the law to receive goods that are reasonably suitable for their manufactured purpose, that are in good working order and that are free from defects, Mohamed said.nomusam@thenewage.co.za
