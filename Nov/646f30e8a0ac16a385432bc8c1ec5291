Brazil&#8217;s once hugely popular leftist president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, mourned Fidel Castro&#8217;s death on Saturday as equivalent to losing a brother.In an emotional statement on his website, Lula called the Cuban revolutionary leader the &#8220;voice of struggle and hope.&#8221;&#8220;His spirit of combativeness and solidarity nourished dreams of liberty, sovereignty and equality,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the darkest moments, when dictatorships dominated the biggest countries in our region, the courage of Fidel Castro and the example of the Cuban revolution inspired those who resisted.&#8221;&#8220;With his death, I feel as if I have lost an older brother,&#8221; added Lula, who founded Brazil&#8217;s Workers&#8217; Party and served two terms as president, but now faces prosecution for alleged corruption.Brazil&#8217;s center-right President Michel Temer, who came to power this year after the bruising impeachment of leftist leader Dilma Rousseff, issued a brief statement calling Castro &#8220;a leader of convictions. He marked the second half of the 20th Century with his firm defense of ideas that he believed in.&#8221;Rousseff, an ally of Lula, was more effusive, calling Castro &#8220;one of the most important contemporary leaders and a visionary.&#8221;&#8220;Progressive dreamers and militants &#8212; all of us who fight for social justice and a less unequal world &#8212; are sad this Saturday, 26 November,&#8221; she said in a statement. &#8220;The death of comandante Fidel Castro, leader of the Cuban revolution and one of the most influential politicians of the 20th century, is a source of mourning and pain.&#8221;-AFP
