PUBLIC consultation is one of the key regulatory tools required to improve transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of regulation as it was done across the Free State the whole of last week.The public consultation session was held for the National Gambling and Liquor Amendment bills.While in Bloemfontein on Wednesday and in Kroonstad on Friday, director of gambling policy and law at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Nkoatse Mashamaite said it was the duty of every South African citizen to participate in policy formulation.He said that the main reason for the consultation session was to present the two bills in order to solicit comments and inputs from the South African public, especially those who might not have had the opportunity to submit their written comments. The main reason for this nationwide drive is to get public input on the bills and to conduct education and awareness on benefits and harms associated with gambling.The government is constitutionally required to involve the public in policy formulation in order to ensure that the laws approved have considered views from all affected. He said that public comments and inputs were required to address issues such as implementing measures to combat illegal gambling, forfeiture of unlawful winnings, implementing education and awareness strategies.Mashamaite said this was ensuring socio-economic effects of gambling are considered before approval of limited pay-out machines, among otherthings. The director for liquor law and policy at the DTI, Clementine Makaepea, said the public consultations on the National Liquor Amendment Bill were meant to solicit input regarding aspects such as the restriction of advertisements of liquor and increasing the drinking and purchase age from 18 to 21 years, among others.She said that both bills were published in the Government Gazette and that the submission of written comments was open for 45 calendar days specifically closing on November 14 and public consultations closing on December 15. The comments will be consolidated, analysed and incorporated in the bill document, Makaepea said.-BECKER SEMELA
