The African National Congress(ANC) has on Tuesday welcomed the Constitutional Court&#8217;s dismissal of the Democratic Alliance&#8217;s application to declare South Africa&#8217;s decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) invalid.&#8220;The application was nothing more than just yet another concerted effort by the DA to defend imperialism and the continued subjugation of Africa under the guise of &#8220;promoting human rights,&#8221; said ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa in a statement.Last Month following Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha confirmation of Cabinet s decision to withdraw from the ICC, the DA indicated it would file an urgent application for direct access to the Constitutional Court to challenge the constitutionality of the decision.Kodwa criticised the DA for bypassing political processes by heading to the courts in an effort to co-govern the state.&#8220;They actively seek to co-govern with the elected executive by using courts as platforms for pursuing mostly political positions. The dismissal of their application is thus a positive rejection of their dangerous attempt at drawing the judiciary into ideological and political contests that do not violate constitutionality,&#8221; said Kodwa.The ANC spokesperson defended government&#8217;s decision to withdraw from the ICC saying &#8220;the withdrawal from the Rome Statute is not unrelated to a growing effort to establish an African Union judicial platform to pursue peace and justice in the continent.&#8221;&#8220;It is a crucial part of a self-conscious act on the part of Africans to accelerate the establishment of pan-African institutions that must guarantee and enforce justice on human rights matters,&#8221; continued Kodwa.Last week Masutha published the proposed Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act Repeal Bill that if passed, will end all authority the ICC has over South Africa.Having signed as a member of the Rome Statute in 1998, South Africa had adhered to the rules until 2015 when Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir visited Johannesburg on the invitation of the African Union (AU).A court application by lobby group, Southern African Litigation Centre, led to a high court order calling for the government to arrest al-Bashir. He is wanted by the ICC for war crimes committed against the people of Sudan during the civil war.However, SA opposed the court application on the grounds that it cannot arrest a sitting President.-TNA Reporter
