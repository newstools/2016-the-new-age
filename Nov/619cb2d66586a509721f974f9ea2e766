Fresh from being nominated for the Fifa Puskas award, Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana has also made the cut for CAF player of the year. Kekana was yesterday revealed as one of five finalists for the prestigious award for players based in Africa alongside teammates Khama Billiat, Denis Onyango and Keagan Dolly.Rainford Kalaba of TP Mazembe is the only non-South African on the list. Regarding the Puskas award, the powerful Sundowns midfielder cracked the nod alongside Barcelona s duo of Lionel Messi and Neymar as well as Athletico Madrid s Saul Niguez. Other nominees include Spain star Mario Gaspar, Wales forward Hal Robson-Kanu, Marlone of Brazil, Venezuela s Daniuska Rodr guez, Finland s Simon Skrabb and Mohd Faiz Subri of Malaysia.Kekana follows in the footsteps of former teammate Katlego Mphela, nominated for his goal against Spain in the 2009 Confederations Cup and Siphiwe Tshabalala for his strike against Mexico in the opening match of the 2010 Fifa World Cup. No African has ever made the top three, named after former Real Madrid and Hungary talisman Ferenc Puskas. I am proud of myself. This is not something that happens often where African players get nominated by Fifa, especially in this category, Kekana said. It is a special moment for me and the country. The other goals are good, but I have watched mine again and I feel it deserves to be a Puskas winner.We were playing away against Cameroon, a big football country. I have put in a lot of work so that was not something that just came off. Kekana will lead his side at Loftus Versfeld stadium against Golden Arrows in their league match tonight (7.30pm).mmasekepem@thenenewage.co.za-Mmasekepe Matsebane
