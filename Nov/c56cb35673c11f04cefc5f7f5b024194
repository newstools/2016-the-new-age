A Congolese journalist working for state media was shot dead Monday night at his home in the centre of the country, Congo&#8217;s National Press Union (UNPC) said Wednesday.&#8220;We condemn the death of Marcel Lubala of RTNC (Congolese National Radio and Television) who was struck down on Monday night as he slept peacefully with his family,&#8221; said UNPC president Joseph Boucard Kasonga Tshilunde.Lubala was the 16th journalist in 10 years to be slain in Democratic Republic of Congo, the UNPC president said.Tshilunde also said he was &#8220;deeply troubled&#8221; by the fact that the murder took place when &#8220;only the police carries out night patrols in the city of Mbuji-Mayi&#8221;, capital of Eastern Kasai province.An overnight curfew was slapped on Mbuji-Mayi late September following fierce clashes between police and supporters of a local chief killed the previous month in the neighbouring province of Central Kasai. Around 100 people died in the clashes.A source close to the Eastern Kasai governor said a series of robberies had taken place during the curfew and that police could be behind the journalist&#8217;s death.Early this month a local media rights group, Journalists In Danger (JED), noted in its annual report that targeted attacks against Congolese journalists were on the increase.&nbsp;-AFP
