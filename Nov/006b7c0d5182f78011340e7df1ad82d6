ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe described yesterday s meeting with disgruntled party stalwarts and veterans as robust and candid .Speaking on the outcomes of the meeting outside Pretoria, Mantashe said the party s stalwarts did not shy away from raising their concerns on the leadership of the ruling party.He said they agreed to have a follow-up meeting before year-end. We want to give the first day of the NEC to the veterans, then continue the rest of the NEC over two days. We are quite happy with the meeting (it) was candid, open (and) difficult sometimes but it s important for the health of the ANC, he said.Mantashe said the public utterances made by the ANC stalwarts were not in the best interests of the movement. The question of what is said publicly is quite important. Things that normally and ordinarily get resolved get spoiled in the process of announcing things prematurely to the media, he said.ANC veteran Wally Serote said the ANC NWC made a concession on the stalwarts request for a consultative conference. Yes, we are discussing it. It s on the table (and) we are discussing the modalities for it, Serote said.Serote echoed Mantashe on the frankness of the discussions held There were difficult moments, we agreed on many issues. We agreed that we ll be guided by the culture, tradition and values of the ANC and that is extremely important for us, he said.Serote also said veterans and stalwarts who signed an open letter calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down could not be regarded as holding the views of the collective. As a group of veterans we have never called for the president to resign. If they utter them they do so in their personal capacity, he said.Bonolo Selebanobonolos@thenewage.co.za
