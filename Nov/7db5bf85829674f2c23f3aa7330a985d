African National Congress (ANC) in Johannesburg region will on Wednesday brief media to dispel claims that the ANC administration in the city, did nothing during its tenure as government. ANC in Joburg said Mashaba cancelled a critical project that was aimed at changing the lives of the people in the city. Mashaba did not only cancel critical projects, he also alleges that the ANC administration did nothing to deal with corruption, ANC Joburg said in a statement. The party also said the reason why Mashaba cancelled his State of the City address was because he had nothing to report to the people, because since he took office he had not delivered to the people of Johannesburg as per his acceptance speech. Former Mayor Parks had previously asked Mashaba not to cancel his flagship projects. However, Mashaba had promised not to can all projects but would instead try to implement them for six months to see if they will produce any results. I had a meeting with senior heads of departments and I said to them, we&#8217;re not dropping anything. Give me three to six months and let us implement these policies to see if they will yield any positive feed back, Mashaba said. In September Mashaba committed to put the brakes on the development of any new bicycle lanes until every road in Johannesburg has been tarred. I was concerned to note that R70m has been set aside for the development of bicycle lanes and I intend putting a halt to this project, said Mashaba.The new Mayor also took a swipe at his predecessors in the council accusing them of misusing council funds. There was R5bn in unauthorised, irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure over the last administration s term in office and this will simply not be tolerated under the new administration and any case of wrongdoing will be exposed and punished, Mashaba said.-Sipho Jack
