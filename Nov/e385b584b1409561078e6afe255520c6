Fifa monitoring committee chairperson Tokyo Sexwale has continued his bid to resolve the football impasse between Israel and Palestine.Sexwale had separate meetings with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the past two days.The objective of the discussions was to provide both leaders with an update of the work of the monitoring committee regarding the contentious question of Israeli clubs playing in the settlements.Also on the agenda was the issue of the movement of people and football goods in and out of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza.Sexwale, who unsuccessfully ran for the Fifa presidency, met with Netanyahu at the latter s office in Jerusalem and proceeded to have another meeting with Abbas in his Ramallah office.Also present at the meetings was Sexwale s delegation as well as members of either the Israel Football Association (IFA) or the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), who are members of the monitoring committee, including PFA president Jibril Rajoub and IFA general secretary Rotem Kamer. We were heartened with the spirit of commitment to resolving these difficult questions by all sides, Sexwale said. We shall be providing further reports to the Fifa Council in January based upon certain key essential principles including commitment to finding resolutions based on Fifa principles, the application of Fifa decisions within various confederations even-handedly, the utilisation of football as a bridge building endeavour to bring joy amongst the people of the world, paying due regard to questions of internal agreements and most importantly to ensure that the door of politics is firmly shut outside of sport. The visits also saw Sexwale and his delegation conduct in-depth discussions with the Israeli Minister of Culture and Sport Miri Regev in Jerusalem and Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, head of the Israeli opposition in the Knesset, Isaac Herzog, and Jerusalem mayor Nier Barkat.The indefatigable Sexwale will head to Zurich to brief his bosses, Fifa president Gianni Infantino and Fifa secretary-general Fatma Samoura, who have both committed to visiting the region at the appropriate time in the near future. Sexwale has committed to continuing with his role as head of the monitoring committee.The committee was established based on the decision by the 65th Fifa congress last May after the Palestine FA withdrew its proposal for suspension of the Israel Football Association.KGOMOTSO SETHUSHAkgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
