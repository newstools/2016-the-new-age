Philip Morris International, the world&#8217;s largest international tobacco company, could eventually stop selling cigarettes, its chief executive told the BBC on Wednesday, as it launched its alternative product IQOS in the UK market.The company&#8217;s IQOS smokeless cigarette which is already on sale in over a dozen markets including Japan, Switzerland and Italy, heats tobacco enough to produce a vapor without burning it. The company believes that makes it much less harmful than cigarettes.&#8220;I believe there will come a moment in time where I would say we have sufficient adoption of these alternative products &#8230; to start envisaging, together with governments, a phase-out period for cigarettes,&#8221; Andre Calantzopoulos said in an interview on BBC Radio 4.&#8220;I hope this time will come soon,&#8221; he added.&nbsp;_REUTERS
