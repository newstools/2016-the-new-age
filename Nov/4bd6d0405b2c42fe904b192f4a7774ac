An undisclosed amount of money has been set aside by the provincial department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs for the renovation of the main offices of the Dipaleseng local municipality in Balfour.The municipality accommodates towns such as Siyathemba, Greylingstad, Grootvlei, Val and Willemsdal and falls under the Gert Sibande district municipality.Last year, a number of violent protests were also seen in the local municipality as residents demanded to be incorporated into Gauteng due to poor service delivery and other related issues.The renovation of the offices followed the promise made by the department during the announcement of its budget for the 2016-17 financial year.Cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC Refilwe Mtshweni said the completion of the project was set to be completed in March next year. Mtshweni made the announcement after she led a sod-turning ceremony in Balfour last week as a symbol of the starting of the project.She said the renovation of the offices would also improve facilities and restore the dignity of the municipality through the provision of viable services. Improvement for the efficiency of the municipality to manage its affairs is at the core of the renovation. This multimillion-rand project is aimed at face lifting and expanding the office facility by improving its institutional capability to deliver proper and satisfactory services to the local community of Dipaleseng. Municipalities, as the third sphere of government, are central to the delivery of basic services such as water, sanitation, electricity, road construction, processing of vehicle licences, registration of property and indigent individuals , Mtshweni said.France Nyakafrancen@thenewage.co.za
