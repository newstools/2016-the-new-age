Police officers in various parts of the province have been urged to remain committed in the force and ensure that they are always fully serving community members with pride and dignity.They have also been asked to avoid as much as possible, from putting the police force s name in disrepute.Community safety, security and liaison MEC Pat Ngomane issued the warning when he presided over the MEC s Excellence Awards Ceremony at the Elangeni Lodge outside Malelane at the weekend.The awards were aimed at acknowledging the police stations that were meeting the expectations and identifying those still underperforming and in need of intervention.Ngomane said the province had no space to accommodate lazy police officers and it was never too late for such officers to pull up their socks. These awards are about the people and communities that we are serving. That is why we should continue to treat them with the seriousness that has associated with the awards over the years. We named them MEC s Excellence Awards as they are about excellence in the services that the police stations and the department are delivering to communities, Ngomane said.He also warned officers who jeopardised the police force s mission in the fight against crime by colluding with criminals. These awards are expected to assist in driving home messages that there are many police men and women who are committed in their work. Let us therefore not over-generalise the few individuals whose levels of integrity are at times low and often to the detriment to our communities. If we continue to paint everybody with the same brush, hardworking and honest officers who some are recipients of the MEC s Excellence Awards today will be discouraged, Ngomane said.The ceremony saw the Ermelo cluster policing commander Brig Lizzy Mtungwa walking away with an award on behalf of the Ermelo police station which was recognised as the best overall performing police station in the province.Provincial police commissioner LtGen Mondli Zuma was also presented with a good performance award at the same event.francen@thenewage.co.za
