THE South African Football Players Union (Safpu) wants to intervene in the Kaizer Chiefs and Itumeleng Khune row following the player s decision to sign an endorsement deal without obtaining permission from the club.The Bafana Bafana goalkeeper became one of South Africa s highest paid players when he signed a new deal with Chiefs in July 2015 and it seems his contract prohibits him from signing with new personal sponsors without authorisation. A Sunday newspaper reported two weeks ago that Khune is facing legal action from the club after signing a deal with Danup yogurt. Khune basically breached his contract of employment with Chiefs by signing an endorsement deal without the authorisation of the club, said an anonymous source as quoted by the publication. He is the property of the club and he can t go around endorsing products that are not aligned with the club without the blessings of the club. Safpu acting president Tebogo Monyai said they had been trying to get hold of Khune to offer assistance. I immediately called him after seeing the report. Khune had just played the Telkom Knockout game against Free State Stars and he said he couldn t talk at the time. He promised to set a time after doing duties for Bafana Bafana. As the union we are prepared to help him in whatever way we can, Monyai said. Endorsement contracts remain a contentious issue for local players. Three years ago, Bafana players Steven Pienaar, Katlego Mphela and Siphiwe Tshabalala launched a lawsuit against South African Breweries, claiming they had been exploited by the company. The trio claimed SAB used photos of them in a billboard advert to promote alcohol unlawfully, without even paying them a cent in compensation. But Safa argued that the national squad members had no right to endorse any products without consent from the association and so they had no right to claim damages. news@thenewage.co.za
