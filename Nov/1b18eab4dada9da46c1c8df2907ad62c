Wits University is considering taking action against some of its officials who allegedly failed a rape victim at the campus by not meeting the institution s commitment to provide a safe space for complainants of gender-based harm.This comes after vice chancellor Prof Adam Habib received a report conducted by gender activist Nomboniso Gasa, on the officials conduct when the matter was reported last month.A female student, who was allegedly raped last month and then tried to commit suicide, lived at the same campus residence as the perpetrator.The Wits SRC alleged that some officials were not sympathetic and did not act immediately after the matter was reported. Some officials did not demonstrate sufficient empathy and care and failed the complainant by not meeting the university s commitment to providing a safe space for complainants of gender-based harm, Habib said.He said the report recommended that the university consider sanctioning officials who failed to abide by university processes.Gasa urged the university to avoid a stituation where a complainant and the person against who she had lodged a complaint, continue to reside in the same residential block. The report particularly recommends that measures be immediately implemented within residences to ensure that these lapses are not repeated, Habib said. It recommends that those decisions, operations and structures within residences are appropriately student-centred and gender-sensitive. The investigation into the rape complaint is still ongoing and it would be concluded by the end of this week.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
