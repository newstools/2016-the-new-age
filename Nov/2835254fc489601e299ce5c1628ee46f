Formula One team boss and majority shareholder Frank Williams has left hospital after recovering from pneumonia, his daughter and deputy principal Claire Williams said on Thursday.The 74-year-old, whose team won seven drivers titles and nine constructors&#8217; championships between 1980 and 1997, has been tetraplegic and in a wheelchair since a car accident in France in 1986.&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased and happy to say that he is now back home, back at the factory with us. He came out of hospital on Monday,&#8221; Claire Williams told reporters after announcing the team&#8217;s 2017 driver lineup of Finland&#8217;s Valtteri Bottas and Canadian teenager Lance Stroll.&#8220;He contracted pneumonia after the Italian Grand Prix at Monza and has been in hospital since the start of September. It was a slow recovery but&#8230;he&#8217;s pretty much back to the old Frank we know and love.&#8221;Williams founded the team in 1977 with Patrick Head and has said he has no plans to retire, keeping a close eye on sponsorship and business dealings. Williams Grand Prix Holdings are listed on the Entry Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.&#8211;Reuters
