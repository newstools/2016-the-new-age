The ANC is a reservoir of popular power and dialogue is its historical strength.The ANC has been accused by its members and ordinary citizens as an organisation that has been growing in egotism. It has been discomforting for others in senior leadership to take this brand of popular condemnation. The frontline leaders have taken such reference in person and not as an organisation.This resulted in some of the leaders hypocritically calling for a closing of ranks among ANC cadres, thereby treating authentic brotherly critique with hostility. A retreat into self through the closing of ranks simply aggravated the perception or conception of an ANC that was indeed arrogant and reneging from long-standing traditions of the organisation.Yet it is the past and present group of leaders that have characterised the ANC as the leader of society and not only its card-carrying members.Not so long ago, President Jacob Zuma addressing the Gauteng ANC manifesto launch at the FNB Stadium prior to the local government elections this year, urged all members of the organisation to accept the candidate list process outcomes. He reminded those in attendance that the ANC is the leader of society and its members had to lead by example for society at large.Oliver Tambo, speaking at the 48th national conference of the ANC in 1991 in Durban, said: Even as we provided leadership, we were always conscious of the fact that the ANC was the people s parliament. This conference sought to assist the ANC to revive itself along the founding principles of the organisation and the ideals of the Freedom Charter.ANC the realm of large civicBy the notion of people s parliament Tambo meant the ANC offered a public and democratic platform for constructive engagement by its members and those of society. He was deliberately inclusive. It is within this context that the ANC constantly mobilises society and does not limit itself to its card-carrying members come national election time in South Africa. That is where it derives its popular mandate and mass endorsement to govern our country as designated by the democratic Constitution, an antithesis of the status quo ante.Both the notion of the ANC as leader of society and people s parliament vindicate acknowledgment that the organisation, besides its internal modus operandi, is heavily interlocked with society, the realm of the large civic.Opportunistic disengagementThe leadership cannot, when challenged, seek disengagement from the realm of the large civic and remind all and sundry that it has its own narrow modus operandi to tackle that which concerns all interested in its well-being or ruinous-being. The quest of accountability and re-kindlement cannot be dismissed with charges of society being meddlesome. Such a posture defeats Zuma s assertion of an ANC that is a leader of society.Linked to this were the concerted attempts to ridicule parts of the large civic who ventured to remember that as stalwarts 101 the ANC to them was a people s parliament where they could echo their frustrations and even give blessings where there is visible intent to prop up those in charge.It is in this context that the calls for a meeting with President Zuma by the Stalwarts 101 should have been understood. Any posture that charged the stalwarts 101 , who are an important component of society and mature part of ANC s history, in seeking Zuma s audience as presenting intrusive conduct prostitutes Tambo s version of ANC being a people s parliament and Zuma s version of it being a leader of society .The recent gathering at St George s Pretoria between the national working committee of the ANC and the Stalwarts 101 breathes Tambo s wisdom and distinctive leadership. It must have taken out the bargaining chip from the internal centrifugal forces that prey on divisions and factionalism.As the parties found common ground and commitment to meet more, the voices of discord and forces of dissonance became weakest and they shall be the most dangerous in upsetting cohesiveness for the sake of our future.The stalwarts belong, broadly speaking, to the society the ANC at all times sought to lead. They belong to it in two quantities.Firstly, as part of the aggregate whole of people living together organised or in some instances disorganised as a community under the vision of the Freedom Charter.Secondly, as a consciously organised assemblage that transmits a particular interest consistent with the dynamics of conflict and convergence inherent in the national democratic revolution.So whichever holds true, the Stalwarts 101 qualify for an audience with the leadership of the ANC at a higher level.Not being active in branches is not a crime of such a society but an indictment on the leadership in its opportunistic expedition to close ranks and retreat into itself.Dialogue: the ANC s historical strengthIt is through appreciating the strength of dialogue and using it to discharge its responsibility to lead society that the ANC agreed to meet a group of around 60 Afrikaner delegates in 1987 in Dakar, Senegal. The ANC never viewed this grouping as unqualified to engage with it. In actual fact this kind of interface changed people like Van Zyl Slabbert and Dr Alex Boraine into models of modern day patriotic Afrikaners. Indeed those it met were also prominent personalities like the Stalwarts 101, the latter with better struggle credentials.Nelson Mandela, while in prison in the 1980s engaged with Dr Niel Barnard head of intelligence and his team in punting the idea for negotiated settlement. These interactions did not diminish the reality that both represented two different political worlds which for their existence needed their interaction for the sake of our future.The mutual suspicion that one was captured by the East and another by the West did not serve as a hindrance towards an interface for a common future. The suspicion between a pro-Zuma group and the Stalwarts 101 about each undertaking a foreign agenda is just a reincarnation of history s trust deficit.Overall, there must have been a realisation that both parties were victims of the phenomenon of social distance, which manifests into a dialogue of the deaf and suspicious. The assertion that Ahmed Kathrada, Gertrude Shope, Cheryl Carolus, Barbara Hogan, Murthy Morobe and Wally Serote have no struggle credentials would have probably been exposed for naivety upon introduction. Overall, the meeting between the national working committee and the Stalwarts 101 was an important development in tackling the ANC s declining mass endorsement.The exchange on a consultative conference is steeped in the ANC s wealth of history as the 1985 Kabwe national consultative conference in Zambia exhibits. This conference, among other things, strengthened the presidency of Oliver Tambo to interact more with other forces to ensure that the ANC was a leader of society.The ANC must understand the society it wants to lead is characterised by pluralism and its membership base, which is part of society, does not constitute the electoral popular constituency and a closed door approach is not in its favour if it s to be a people s parliament.To refurbish its credibility and revive its legitimacy the ANC leadership cannot promote political insecurity and retreat to its membership base and structures only. Its strength in the large civic lies in an unregistered popular electoral constituency.After their first interface with the national working committee, Wally Serote of the stalwarts said that as a collective they have never called for Zuma s resignation.In contrast, which is also positive, is that the president in his address to a cadres forum in Pietermaritzburg indicated willingness to comply if the leadership of the ANC were to say step aside. No one is entitled to any position. In the aftermath of dialogue of the deaf the internal centrifugal forces are the real defect to any seed of common cohesive trek. As the social distance begins to be dense and Tambo s common sense consultative conferences reign, the centrifugal energies will crumble apart while the incumbents must guard against centrism not to bastardise internal mechanisms.In this context, Zuma could live by his dictum of step aside if the leadership says so for the sake of our future.Tankiso Mike Fafuli is an advisor to the NUM president and writes in his personal capacity
