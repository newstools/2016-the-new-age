Suspended African National Congress(ANC) Western Cape Chairperson Marius Fransman on Friday called on the party&#8217;s Secretary General Gwede Mantashe not to use the office for factional battles.Fransman told ANN7 on Friday that the office of the SG was being biased and that if you didn t support a certain group of individuals you will be victimised. If you are against regime change you will be dealt with but if you are for regime change you will be spared, he said.The party&#8217;s National Disciplinary Committee (NDC) on Thursday suspended Fransman&#8217;s from the ANC for five years.Fransman was found guilty on &#8220;two counts of misconduct &#8211; abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand and for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute.&#8221;The suspended WC ANC leader on Friday however accused Mantashe of using his office to push his political career. There is a huge problem of inconsistency. I will not be quiet if the office of the SG is used for factional battles, Fransman said.Fransman said attacks that are against him were vicious and he is planning on appealing his suspension.On the issue of documents, Fransman said the NDC lied when it said it had given all the necessary documentation to him. He reiterated his innocence saying that he would stand on the side of justice. There has been people that have come to me and told me that they have been paid to lie about me. Those who know me,know very well that i will never abuse women, he added.ANC&#8217;s communications manager Khusela Sangoni said she would not comment on allegations made by Fransman but however urged him to raise any concerns through the right channels.Meanwhile, political analyst Tshepo Kgadima on Friday said Fransman should have held a higher ground by answering the procedural irregularities he was highlighting through his legal council.Kgadima added that since the expulsion of the then ANCYL leader Julius Malema, the ANC had not really managed to deal with the out come of the Disciplinary actions in an amicable manner. You can&#8217;t selectively discipline people, if you look at the charges of Malema, they were lesser than the one of Fransman but he received a harsher sentence, Kgadima said.Kgadima said he is not surprised that at this stage there will be people who will be purged, building up to the national congress.-Sipho Jack
