Other ministers in this cluster will also reply to questions in the House.The question about the inevitable period of conflict, which was asked by the DA s Belinda Bozzoli, is one of a few about tertiary education that he will have to answer.Apart from looking ahead to 2018, Nzimande will also be required to speculate about the challenges awaiting universities, technical and vocational education and training colleges when students turn register next year.From the EFF comes a question and an accusation aimed at Nzimande. According to the party, his department learnt nothing from the specified protests of 2015 .Now it wants to hear from him what plans the Department of Higher Education has put into place to ensure there was consensus between it, universities and students to minimise protests in the 2017 academic year.His Cabinet colleague, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, will have to account for the leak of matric exam papers in Limpopo in 2015 and this year. She must answer whether there were gaps in the manner in which the question papers were secured from the moment they were compiled until the day they were written.Motshekga will also be expected to respond to a question about whether her department plans to recover money from teachers who acquired positions through fraudulently acquired qualifications.Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula will be taken to task over this year s Comrades Marathon and Olympic Games.He will have to explain why it took more than five months to finalise the payment of performance incentives to the five South African athletes who took the top three positions in the iconic Comrades and more than three months to pay performance incentives for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games athletes as part of the Ministerial Excellence Recognition programme.Mbalula will also have to enlighten the House on his plans to fight doping in sport at university level.The constitutional grounds, if any, for the visit of National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams to Luthuli House for a meeting will have to be furnished by Justice Minister Michael Masutha.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
