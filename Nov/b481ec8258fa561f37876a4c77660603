An indictment has been issued by a US grand jury for a former Autonomy executive accused of inflating the British software firm&#8217;s financial performance before Hewlett-Packard paid $11 billion for it in 2011.Former Autonomy chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain of Britain was charged with fraud and conspiracy crimes carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.The indictment issued in San Francisco federal court on Thursday calls for Hussain to surrender at least $7.7 million he made from his shares in publicly traded Autonomy when it was bought by HP in what turned out to be a disastrous deal.Beginning in October of 2009 or even earlier, Hussain and others engaged in a scheme to inflate Autonomy&#8217;s financial performance to earn bonuses, gain prestige, drive up the share price, and get more money from a buyer, according to the indictment.The scheme included false entries in books and records, as well as &#8220;intimidating, pressuring, and paying off&#8221; people who criticized or complained about its accounting practices, the indictment said.In late 2012, HP reported a write-down of $8.8 billion, including more than $5 billion it attributed to inflated data from Autonomy, which it acquired the prior year.The California-based computer titan demanded US and British authorities investigate Autonomy, saying &#8220;accounting improprieties&#8221; led to an &#8220;overvalued&#8221; acquisition price, which forced HP to take the huge write-down in value.HP added that it had launched an internal investigation &#8220;after a senior member of Autonomy&#8217;s leadership team came forward.&#8221;As a result, HP said it believed &#8220;that Autonomy was substantially overvalued at the time of its acquisition.&#8221;HP has also filed a civil suit. Autonomy executives have denied any wrongdoing.AFP
