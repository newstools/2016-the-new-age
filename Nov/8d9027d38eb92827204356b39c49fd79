Plans to remedy Joburg ratepayers billing woes are set to get a revamp from next year when the city s billing regionalisation initiative kicks off.Billing regionalisation will allow ratepayers to choose on which day of the month they prefer to pay their municipal accounts.It is believed that the initiative will combat inaccurate bills which often come as a result of estimations rather than accurate consumption. According to the city s spokesperson, Kgamanyane Maphologela, the city was streamlining its billing operations which would result in improved billing accuracy. The billing regionalisation project essentially means the customers will be billed per the region of their residing areas. It also means the customers will be able to know exactly when the city will come to their area to read their meters, Maphologela said.The system which is set to be launch from February 1 next year is expected to ultimately improve customers experiences. Joburg residents have often been critical of the city s billing system which saw them stuck with inflated bills. The billing schedule is open all working days of the month, consisting of 21 portions. Each portion caters for each regional township in the city, which strains the physical meter reading that impacts on billing accuracy, Maphologela said. Now we want to reduce the number of many portions and rather focus on each region and improve the quality of meter reading, he said.Johannesburg s MMC of finance Dr Rabelani Dagada has also previously identified by-laws allowing for three or six-month estimations as the cause for billing problems residents experienced in the past.Once the billing regionalisation project kicks off, ratepayers will have the option to choose their rate due date between the 15th and the 28th of each month. Also, where ratepayers don t choose their due dates, the due date will default to 15 days after billing.Ratepayers wishing to choose their own due dates can phone the call centre at 0860 562 874 or send an email to duedates@joburg.org.za.Maphologela said another advantage of the project was that, customers would be able know exactly which region within the city their suburbs fall under and the dates when the meter readers would visit their areas to read the meters by tracking this on the city s website.Earlier in the year the city had managed to grow its revenue collection to R42bn and also committed to installing smart electricity meters across Joburg at a cost of R1.2bn.The city of Joburg has asked that ratepayers with billing queries log their complaints via the call centre or by going to a walk-in centre. An 8002 query number will be issued and most queries require a turnaround time of 30 days.SIPHIWE MCHUNU news@thenewage.co.za
