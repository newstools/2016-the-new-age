Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF) leader Julius Malema s case has been postponed to June 5 next year.The EFF leader appeared briefly before Magistrate Mziwonke Hinxa at the Bloemfontein Magistrate&#8217;s Court over utterances he made two years ago while addressing his supporters at a rally.Malema was served with two summons by the National Prosecuting Authority(NPA) for contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act for instructing members of the EFF to occupy any vacant land wherever it may be found.Malema&#8217;s lawyer Tumi Mokwena on Monday began proceedings by asking the court for postponement to be able to give Malema time to challenge the matter brought before him.Advocate Mokwena asked for the matter to be postponed for 8 months if the state wouldn t challenge the application.During the last court appearance in Newcastle Magistrate Court last week, Malema&#8217;s attorney asked court to set the trial date after the High court ruling on the unconstitutionality of the Riotous act to which State prosecutor Jabulani Mlotshwa agreed.On top of facing a charge of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act, Malema has also been criticised for making racist comments, with AfriForum now exploring legal options.Addressing party supporters on Monday outside the Newcastle Magistrate s Court, he said he wanted to disturb white people s peace, that all land in South Africa belonged to black people and that it should be taken from whites without compensation.Malema also said that he was not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now .Meanwhile earlier on Monday Malema&#8217;s driver was arrested for clocking at 187km/h in Parys in the Free State. He was caught speeding on their way to Bloemfontein for the court appearance.However the party&#8217;s chairperson Adv. Dali Mpofu refuted claims that Malema was arrested for speeding saying that it was only wishful thinking on the part of the media. Its not him. He&#8217;s already in Bloemfontein, ready to rock and roll,&#8221; Mpofu said.Malema himself tweeted: the report that I m arrested for speeding are absolute nonsense I will be at the Bloemfontein Magistrate Court this morning for Land. Provincial police spokesperson Nako Ramatso confirmed that the EFF leader had not been arrested as the media reports had alleged. Ramatso confirmed that the driver has been arrested and would be charged.Ramatso said the driver&#8217;s reason for speeding was because the pair were running late for the court appearance.-Sipho Jack
