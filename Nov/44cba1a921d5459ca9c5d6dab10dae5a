Closing the inequality gap is essential for SA s future happiness and stabilityThe proposed national minimum wage (NMW) as announced by the deputy president on November 19 is a step in the right direction in closing the inequality gap.South Africans need to close ranks and support this policy proposal with an understanding that, the NMW of R3500 per month is not a decent living wage but levels a playing field upon which ground-breaking engagements on a decent living wage can happen.The fact that 46% of the South African workforce earn less than R3000pm is a confirmation that an intervention of this nature by the government is long overdue. Ours is to work with Nedlac partners to find a lasting solution on the feasibility of the proposal while ensuring trade unions and other stakeholders negotiate a better figure.The report says the commission could not recommend R3700-R4500 proposed by Nedlac partners owing to fears it might lead to job losses.However, the difference between the requested figure and the proposal by the commission is not large, which is a good sign for further negotiations.Those who are critical of the NMW are oblivious of the inequality gap created by the apartheid wage structure. It is meant to cover basic needs for workers and their families while taking into account the realities of a domestic economy.It is not aimed at creating more jobs, other policies are to be developed to address such challenges. Wage difference is among factors blamed for the high levels of inequality in South Africa.However, the system of minimum wage proposed, which is NMW, has more advantages than the sectoral differential system as it covers all workers. It is understandable that some may have legitimate concerns about the proposed NMW.Two questions always arise in all developing countries where the minimum wage is adopted.Firstly, to what extent can the minimum wage be enforced within the environment characterised by casual wage earners and secondly, will it benefit the poor and vulnerable or will it reinforce segmentation and inequality?Even academics in developed countries believe the minimum wage only benefits formal economy workers with no poor families. India is a perfect case study because it is one of the first developing countries to adopt a minimum wage policy.To date, the Minimum Wage Act of 1948 is still considered the most important piece of legislation in India and the country has a strong minimum wage tradition.Unlike South Africa, because of its size, India adopted a sectoral minimum wage (SMW) system applicable to various sectors.Although the NMW and the SMW systems are both legitimate, international experience proves that the NMW adopted by South Africa is the most effective one.The SMW system is too complex and mostly prevalent in India, Asia, Africa, some parts of Latin America and the Caribbean.Using India to measure the impact, it is found that the minimum wage is the third most important factor in reducing poverty after education and geographic location.The fact that in India a high proportion of the poor are casual wage earners, dispels all stereotyped views of the minimum wage.What South Africa requires is a coherent implementation strategy.Simply legislating a national minimum wage will not make it happen. South Africa must adopt a three-pronged implementation approach.Firstly, reluctant employers are to be persuaded to understand the NMW improves efficiency owing to a satisfied workforce.Secondly, policy interpretation, capacity building for employers and transparency will be required.Lastly, enforcement, which requires intense monitoring focusing on detection of non-compliance and sanctioning those who refuse to comply.The fundamental principle always to be borne in mind is that the empowerment of workers is core to the enforcement of their rights in the work place. This means that a balanced approach is crucial in ensuring both employers and employees are equally capacitated.It is important to empower workers to understand what is due to them. They must be left in a position where they are able to enforce their own rights by themselves.-SIBUSISO NHLANGOTHISibusiso Nhlangothi is a senior government employee and a political analyst writing in his personal capacity
