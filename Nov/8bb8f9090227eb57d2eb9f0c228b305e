A cross-dressing social media star dubbed &#8220;Africa&#8217;s male Barbie&#8221; has shot to fame in Nigeria, sparking a charged debate in a conservative country where alternative lifestyles remain frowned upon.Okuneye Idris Olarenwaju, who goes by the name Bobrisky on SnapChat, makes his living selling 100,000 naira ($317) skin-whitening creams while chronicling online his life of luxury in Lagos.But Bobrisky really went viral in late October, when an aide to President Muhammadu Buhari and a marketing executive pulled out of appearing with him on a social media panel in Abuja, the nation&#8217;s capital.&#8220;The inclusion of Bobrisky unfortunately sensationalises and radicalises what should otherwise be a serious discourse on new approaches to media engagement,&#8221; said Alder Consulting, whose social media executive withdrew.Meanwhile, Buhari&#8217;s social media aide Bashir Ahmad said he would be &#8220;unavailable for the event&#8221;.Embracing the mantra of every successful reality star &#8212; there&#8217;s no such thing as bad publicity &#8212; Bobrisky went ahead with the talk.&#8220;The organisers invited me to speak on the fact that people are talking about Bobrisky,&#8221; the 25-year-old told AFP, characteristically referring to himself in the third person.&#8220;Them withdrawing wasn&#8217;t nice. In Nigeria, the majority of people here judge you so fast,&#8221; added Bobrisky, who recounts online how his lifestyle is funded by a rich, mystery man he refers to only as &#8220;bae.&#8221;&#8220;We are in this life once, people should be given the freedom to express themselves.&#8221;&#8211; Rebellious &#8211;In the wake of the scandal, Bobrisky has earned himself a reputation for being a rebel.It&#8217;s a dangerous reputation in a country where in 2014, former president Goodluck Jonathan signed the same-sex marriage prohibition bill, forbidding not only marriage, but same-sex cohabitation and any &#8220;public show of same-sex amorous relationship&#8221; with penalties ranging from 10 to 14 years in prison.But Bobrisky, who gets over 150,000 views on each video he posts, insisted his appeal isn&#8217;t because he&#8217;s a civil rights crusader.&#8220;People love the fact that I&#8217;m real,&#8221; he said, speaking at his apartment in Lekki, an upmarket suburb in Nigeria&#8217;s commercial hub.&#8220;It&#8217;s about the way I dance, because I&#8217;m a very good dancer, and my makeup.&#8221;Bobrisky has a slight build, with a close crop of black hair he wears in gelled curls. He&#8217;s wearing red sweatpants with a Mickey Mouse cartoon embroidered near a pocket and a hot pink mesh tanktop, as he gets ready for a night out in his small living room, decorated with gold and black wallpaper and a crystal chandelier.&#8220;I&#8217;m doing a party look, a diva look,&#8221; he said as he applies the first out of many layers of foundation, explaining that he was 12 when he first experimented with makeup. &#8220;I liked my mom&#8217;s look,&#8221; he said with a demure smile.He finishes his makeup by gluing gold glitter on the inside corner of his eyes near the tear ducts, the sparkling beginning of a swooping cat eye even Cleopatra would envy.&#8220;Beauty is pain,&#8221; he said, wincing as he applies the chemical glue, &#8220;but this is the one that holds the glitter on the longest.&#8221;&#8211; Unlikely activist &#8211;Bobrisky is the exception in Nigeria.Although no one has yet been charged under the 2014 same-sex marriage law, it has led to &#8220;real fear and abuse&#8221;, said Wendy Isaack, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, who wrote an October report on the issue.&#8220;It created opportunities for the police and members of the public to engage in extortion and get money from people they believe to be LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender),&#8221; Isaack said.&#8220;If you pass a law that leads to violence with impunity, you&#8217;re creating a situation where there&#8217;s lack of respect for rule of law in Nigeria, and that&#8217;s not helpful,&#8221; Isaack said.Still, Bobrisky says he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t bother&#8221; with the haters and instead is focussing on launching a YouTube channel where he&#8217;ll do makeup tutorials.It&#8217;s exactly that born-this-way defiance that endears him to fans.&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t have to take on a leadership role,&#8221; said Olumide Femi Makanjuola, deputy director of The Initiative for Equal Rights, a Nigeria-based non-profit organisation advocating for LGBT rights.&#8220;People like Bobrisky are creating the conversation. They didn&#8217;t start out to be an activist, but it happened. That&#8217;s one of the powerful things of pop culture.&#8221;Transvestites are almost non-existent in Nigeria, while gays are regularly the victims of violence.-AFP
