Three key players who contributed massively to Mamelodi Sundowns CAF Champions League success are yet to commit their long-term futures to the club.Added to that, coach is yet to sign a new contract, contrary to reports that he has already signed a four- year extension.Brazilians captain Hlompo Kekana and his deputy Thabo Nthethe are believed to be facing unclear futures as they are yet to put signatures to new deals.Nthethe has a one-year extension option on the two-and-a-half-year contract he signed when he joined from Bloemfontein Celtic two seasons ago.Leonardo Castro also finds himself in a similar situation as he is yet to sign a new deal.He signed a one-year contract when he arrived at Chloorkop but has since attracted interest from overseas and is understood to be holding out for a megabucks deal.The Colombian striker endeared himself to the Downs faithful with his scoring prowess that helped lead to their cup double achievement last season.Castro was part of the deadly CBD frontline partnership along with Keagan Dolly and Khama Billiat that was instrumental in the team s success, despite missing much of the CAF campaign through injury.Mosimane, however, remains the biggest concern as his successful Champions League campaign has attracted interest from as far away as Egypt where Zamalek are reportedly keen on him.Mosimane is on a rolling month to month deal at Sundowns and this should be a cause for concern for the club to which he has brought a lot of success since he arrived more than three years ago.Unconfirmed reports are that Mosimane could be in line for the Bafana Bafana job once again, with incumbent Shakes Mashaba facing a disciplinary hearing over his criticism of Safa officials.Mosimane has not been drawn to comment on a possible Bafana return, but his thirst for continental football is well known.Sundowns spokesperson Thulani Thuswa said the club would offer comment on developments in terms of contracts, but had not responded by the time of going to press.Linda Ximbanews@thenewage.co.za
