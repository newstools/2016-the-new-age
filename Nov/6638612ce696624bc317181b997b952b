Veteran New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor was cleared Wednesday to play in the second Test against Pakistan after undergoing a further eye examination.However, he will required surgery on his left eye after the match, team physiotherapist Tommy Simsek said.Taylor&#8217;s left eye had a form of scarring that needed attention, but it was not yet impacting on the 32-year-old&#8217;s sight, he added.&#8220;Ross has a pterygium on his left eye, which is gradually getting bigger. Both the specialists he&#8217;s seen in recent days have advised Ross still has 20/20 vision and Ross himself feels confident he is ready to play,&#8221; Simsek said.However, the 77-Test veteran Taylor will miss the limited overs series in Australia early next month while he undergoes surgery.&#8220;Ross will still need to undergo a medical procedure on his eye to remove the pterygium before it gets any larger,&#8221; Simsek said.&#8220;He&#8217;ll have surgery following the Test which rule him out of cricket for approximately four to six weeks.&#8221;-AFP
