Decolonisation Foundation Leader Mzwanele Manyi says South Africa&#8217;s democracy is being abused by people in high positions who have the ability to tarnish reputations without providing facts.The comments come following the surprise resignation of Eskom Chief Executive Officer Brian Molefe on Friday.Manyi believes due to Molefe&#8217;s integrity being called into question following the release of Thuli Madonsela&#8217;s state capture report,South Africa&#8217;s democracy is being abused.&#8220;Our democracy is being abused and this is serious abuse of office by people in positions of power to rubbish people and not provide them with an opportunity to have their say. This is a travesty of justice.&#8221; said ManyiOn Friday Eskom CEO Brian Molefe released a statement announcing his resignation from the power utility.Molefe said he was resigning for personal reasons and that his stepping down was not an admission of guilt on his part.In his statement announcing his exit from the state power utility Molefe says observations made in Madonsela&#8217;s report to his conduct are &#8221; in material respects inaccurate, based on part-facts or simply unfounded.&#8221;&#8221; What the previous Public Protector has done is not herself to investigate to completion, or to allow her office to complete what she initiated too late to complete herself. She has also determined on recording observations without, in crucial respects, putting intended harmful disclosures to me first- as she was by law required to do. She has effectively deffered my constitutional right to be heard to a future date, and to a further body which she has ordered others to assemble.&#8221; reads part of Molofe&#8217;s statement.Trade Federation COSATU President Sdumo Dlamini said the federation would continue to monitor developments around the story adding that he was surprised at Molefes resignation. We will have to hear what the reasons are in the matter at this time and for such a resignation to happen it begs a lot of questions and he would have to take South Africans into his confidence beyond the just the reasons stated, said DlaminiLast week following the release of the State Capture Report Molefe slammed the former public protector for ignoring information supplied to her and failing to afford the victims of her report enough time to respond to allegations.On Friday Molefe said he was confident that when the time came he would clear his name of any wrong doing.&#8211;TNA Reporter
