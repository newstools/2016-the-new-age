An usual excitement displayed by a group of pupils at Giyani High School in Mopani district after writing the mathematics paper 1 question paper alerted invigilators to suspect that something was amiss.Upon further investigation by the invigilators, enough grounds emerged to strengthen their suspicion that the question paper might have been seen by the pupils before entering examination rooms, a source close to the investigation, said.The department of basic education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga yesterday said investigations into the saga were progressing well, but nobody had been implicated yet.Mhlanga said the pupils allegedly shared the paper via Whatsapp before it was written. The department has since ordered that the scripts from suspected pupils be quarantined pending further investigations by the Hawks. Hawks spokesperson Lt-Col Robert Netshiunda yesterday said it was their hope that investigations did not disrupt the entire examination process. A docket has been opened already and investigations are in full swing. There is no time frame to make an arrest for now, but it can be made any time, Netshiunda said.Congress of SA Students leader Ayanda Mokwana had not responded at the time of going to press yesterday.However, several pupils in Mopani district said they were shocked by the leakage. This bad thing will disturb us all because our results may be withheld and a rewrite be ordered while most of us are innocent, a matric pupil said.The latest matric examination paper leakage scandal in the province followed a similar incident during the class of 2015. The life sciences paper 1 and paper 2 question papers were leaked at Marude High School in Mvudi Circuit in Vhembe district last year.The leaked papers were shared by some pupils in the provinces of Gauteng and Mpumalanga via Whatsapp. A total of 15 960 full-time and 1 540 part-time candidates were later forced to rewrite the two papers.montshom@thenewage.co.za
