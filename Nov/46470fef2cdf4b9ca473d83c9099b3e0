African National Congress (ANC) Parliamentary Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu has laid charges against South African Broadcasting Commission s (SABC) group executive of Corporate Affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng on Thursday.In October Motsoeneng alleged that Mthembu had tried to lobby him for a possible business deal in favour of a certain company.ANC s chief whip s legal team sent a letter to Motsoeneng demanding that he immediately issue a public apology and retract his alleged defamatory claims against Mthembu.He further demanded that Motsoeneng must disclose details of the meeting where an attempt of capture allegedly took placed.The chief whip s letter further stated that Motsoeneng failed to provide his legal team with facts of the meeting resulted in lodging papers with the court. There is no doubt that Mr Motsoeneng s claims are unfounded, unsubstantiated and blatantly false. The made-up accusations, aired publicly on live television, were intended to impugn the character of the Chief Whip.Imputing improper motives on the Chief Whip was clearly designed to threaten and blackmail him and the ANC in Parliament into silence on a matter of principle with the hope that the inquiry into the SABC, which the ANC caucus has outspokenly pursued, would be abandoned, Office of the ANC Chief Whip said in a statement.In addition he asked the court to order the SABC s group executive of Corporate Affairs to pay him a tune of R1M. And further issue unconditional public apology for the damage caused to him as a result of Motsoeneng utterances.Mthembu demanded Motsoeneng to issue an apology in both print and broadcast media within seven days of the judgement.-Sipho Jack
